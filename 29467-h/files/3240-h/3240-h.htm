    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A LAMB FOR THE SACRIFICE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; observed Captain Eri cheerfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to average up with
      the mistakes of Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was seated by the open door of the dining room, in the rocker
      with the patched cane seat. He was apparently very busy doing something
      with a piece of fishline and a pair of long-legged rubber boots. Captain
      Perez, swinging back and forth in the parlor rocker with the patch-work
      cushion, was puffing deliberately at a wooden pipe, the bowl of which was
      carved into the likeness of a very rakish damsel with a sailor&rsquo;s cap set
      upon the side of her once flaxen head. In response to his companion&rsquo;s
      remark he lazily turned his sunburned face toward the cane-seated rocker
      and inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on airth are you doin&rsquo; with them boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri tied a knot with his fingers and teeth and then held the boots
      out at arm&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Perez,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m averagin&rsquo; up, same as I told you. Providence
      made me a two-legged critter, and a two-legged critter needs two boots.
      I&rsquo;ve always been able to find one of these boots right off whenever I
      wanted it, but it&rsquo;s took me so plaguey long to find the other one that
      whatever wet there was dried up afore I got out of the house. Yesterday
      when I wanted to go clammin&rsquo; I found the left one on the mantelpiece, no
      trouble at all, but it was pretty nigh high water before I dug the other
      one out of the washb&rsquo;iler. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m splicin&rsquo; &lsquo;em together this way.
      I don&rsquo;t want to promise nothin&rsquo; rash, but I&rsquo;m in hopes that even Jerry
      can&rsquo;t lose &lsquo;em now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Perez. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of that plan. &lsquo;Stead
      of losin&rsquo; one you&rsquo;ll lose both of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but then I shan&rsquo;t care. If there ain&rsquo;t NO boots in sight; I&rsquo;ll go
      barefoot or stay at home. It&rsquo;s the kind of responsibleness that goes with
      havin&rsquo; one boot that&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo; me out. Where IS Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went out to feed Lorenzo. I heard him callin&rsquo; a minute ago. That cat
      ain&rsquo;t been home sence noon, and Jerry&rsquo;s worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A stentorian shout of &ldquo;Puss! puss! Come, kitty, kitty, kitty!&rdquo; came from
      somewhere outside. Captain Eri smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid Lorenzo&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; dissipated in his old age,&rdquo; he observed.
      Then, as a fat gray cat shot past the door, &ldquo;There he is! Reg&rsquo;lar prodigal
      son. Comes home when the fatted ca&rsquo;f&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Captain Jerry appeared, milk pitcher in hand. He entered
      the dining room and, putting the pitcher down on the table, pulled forward
      the armchair with the painted sunset on the back, produced his own pipe,
      and proceeded to hunt through one pocket after the other with a troubled
      expression of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in tunket is my terbacker?&rdquo; he asked, after finishing the round of
      pockets and preparing to begin all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it on the top of the clock a spell ago,&rdquo; said Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that yours, Jerry?&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Eri. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s too bad! I
      see it there and thought &lsquo;twas mine. Here &lsquo;tis, or what&rsquo;s left of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry took the remnant of a plug from his friend and said in an
      aggrieved tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest like you, Eri! Never have a place for nothin&rsquo; and help
      yourself to anything you happen to want, don&rsquo;t make no odds whose &lsquo;tis.
      Why don&rsquo;t you take care of your terbacker, same&rsquo;s I do of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here, Jerry! I ain&rsquo;t so sure that is yours. Let me see it. Humph!
      I thought so! This is &lsquo;Navy Plug&rsquo; and you always smoke &lsquo;Sailor&rsquo;s
      Sweetheart.&rsquo; Talk about havin&rsquo; a place for things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s MY terbacker, if you want to know,&rdquo; observed Captain Perez. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got yours, Eri. Here &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, where IS mine?&rdquo; said Captain Jerry somewhat snappishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet a dollar you&rsquo;ve got it in your pocket,&rdquo; said Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet ten dollars I ain&rsquo;t! I ain&rsquo;t quite a fool yit, Eri Hedge. I guess I
      know&mdash;well, I snum! I forgot that upper vest pocket!&rdquo; and from the
      pocket mentioned Captain Jerry produced the missing tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general laugh, in which Captain Jerry was obliged to join, and
      the trio smoked in silence for a time, while the expanse of water to the
      eastward darkened, and the outer beach became but a dusky streak
      separating the ocean from the inner bay. At length Captain Perez rose and,
      knocking the ashes from his pipe, announced that he was going to &ldquo;show a
      glim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go ahead, Jerry!&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s darker in the grave,&rdquo; observed Captain Perez with lugubrious
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then for the land&rsquo;s sake let&rsquo;s have it light while we can! Here, Jerry!
      them matches is burnt ones. Try this, &lsquo;twon&rsquo;t be so damagin&rsquo; to the
      morals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry took the proffered match and lit the two bracket lamps,
      fastened to the walls of the dining room. The room, seen by the lamplight,
      was shiplike, but as decidedly not shipshape. The chronometer on the
      mantel was obscured by a thick layer of dust. The three gorgeous oil
      paintings&mdash;from the brush of the local sign painter&mdash;respectively
      representing the coasting packet Hannah M., Eri Hedge, Master, and the
      fishing schooners, Georgie Baker, Jeremiah Burgess, Master, and the Flying
      Duck, Perez Ryder, Master, were shrouded in a very realistic fog of the
      same dust. Even the imposing gilt-lettered set of &ldquo;Lives of Great Naval
      Commanders,&rdquo; purchased by Captain Perez some months before, and being
      slowly paid for on an apparently never-ending installment plan, was
      cloaked with it. The heap of newspapers, shoved under the couch to get
      them out of the way, peeped forth in a tell-tale manner. The windows were
      not too clean and the floor needed sweeping. Incidentally the supper table
      had not been cleared. Each one of the three noted these things and each
      sighed. Then Captain Eri said, as if to change the subject, though no one
      had spoken:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What started you talkin&rsquo; about the grave, Perez? Was it them clam
      fritters of Jerry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the ex-skipper of the Flying Duck, pulling at his grizzled
      scrap of throat whisker and looking rather shamefaced. &ldquo;You see, M&rsquo;lissy
      Busteed dropped in a few minutes this mornin&rsquo; while you fellers was out
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Captain Eri and Captain Jerry set up a hilarious shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw! haw!&rdquo; roared the former, slapping his knee. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be so
      fascinatin&rsquo; as you be for no money, Perez. She&rsquo;ll have you yit; you can&rsquo;t
      git away! But say, I don&rsquo;t wonder you got to thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout the grave. Ten
      minutes of M&rsquo;lissy gits me thinkin&rsquo; of things way t&rsquo;other side of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, belay there, Eri&rdquo; protested Captain Perez testily. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t my fault.
      I didn&rsquo;t see her comin&rsquo; or I&rsquo;d have got out of sight. She was cruisin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;round the way she always does with a cargo of gabble, and, she put in
      here to unload. Talk! I never heard a woman talk the way she can! She&rsquo;d be
      a good one to have on board in a calm. Git her talkin&rsquo; abaft the mains&rsquo;l
      and we&rsquo;d have a twenty-knot breeze in a shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it this time?&rdquo; asked Captain Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little of everything. She begun about the &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; sermon that
      Mr. Perley preached at the last &lsquo;Come-Outers&rsquo;&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;. That was what
      started me thinkin&rsquo; about the grave, I guess. Then she pitched into Seth
      Wingate&rsquo;s wife for havin&rsquo; a new bunnit this season when the old one wan&rsquo;t
      ha&rsquo;f wore out. She talked for ten minutes or so on that, and then she
      begun about Parker&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; let go over at the cable station and about the
      new feller that&rsquo;s been signed to take his place. She&rsquo;s all for Parker.
      Says he was a &lsquo;perfectly lovely&rsquo; man and that &lsquo;twas outrageous the way he
      was treated, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t the only one that thinks so,&rdquo; observed Captain Jerry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a heap of folks in this town that think Parker was a mighty fine feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s worth while noticin&rsquo; who they be.
      Perez&rsquo; friend, M&rsquo;lissy, thinks so, and &lsquo;Squealer&rsquo; Wixon and his gang think
      so, and &lsquo;Web&rsquo; Saunders thinks so, and a lot more like them. Parker was TOO
      good a feller, that&rsquo;s what was the matter with him. His talk always
      reminded me of washday at the poorhouse, lots of soft soap with plenty of
      lye in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, M&rsquo;lissy says that the men over to the station&mdash;all except
      Langley, of course&mdash;are mad as all git-out because Parker was let go,
      and she says somebody told somebody else, and somebody else told somebody
      else, and somebody else told HER&mdash;she says it come reel straight&mdash;that
      the men are goin&rsquo; to make it hot for the new feller when he comes. She
      says his name&rsquo;s Hazeltine, or somethin&rsquo; like that, and that he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      get here to-morrer or next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mercy M&rsquo;lissy found it out. If that man
      should git here and she not know it aforehand &lsquo;twould kill her sure as
      fate, and think what a blow that would be to you, Perez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his old-fashioned watch from his pocket and glanced at the dial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t be settin&rsquo; round here much longer,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;John Baxter&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to have that little patch of cranberry swamp of his picked
      to-morrer, and he&rsquo;s expectin&rsquo; some barrels down on to-night&rsquo;s train. John
      asked me to git Zoeth Cahoon to cart &lsquo;em down for him, but I ain&rsquo;t got
      nothin&rsquo; special to do to-night, so I thought I&rsquo;d hitch up and go and git
      &lsquo;em myself. You and Jerry can match cents to see who does the dishes. I
      did &lsquo;em last night, so it&rsquo;s my watch below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t do &lsquo;em,&rdquo; declared Captain Perez. &ldquo;Blessed if I&rsquo;d do
      the durn things to-night if the President of the United States asked me
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sputtered Captain Jerry. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you fellers think I&rsquo;ll do &lsquo;em
      all the time. If you do you&rsquo;re mistook, that&rsquo;s all. &lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t last night you
      done &lsquo;em, Eri; &lsquo;twas the night afore. I done &lsquo;em last night, and I&rsquo;m ready
      to take my chances agin if we match, but I&rsquo;m jiggered if I let you shove
      the whole thing off onto me. I didn&rsquo;t ship for cook no more &lsquo;n the rest of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the others saw fit to answer this declaration of independence
      and there was a pause in the conversation. Then Captain Jerry said
      moodily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use. It don&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What don&rsquo;t work?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this plan of ours. I thought when we fellers give up goin&rsquo; to sea
      reg&rsquo;lar and settled down here to keep house ourselves and live economical
      and all that, that &lsquo;twas goin&rsquo; to be fine. I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t mind doin&rsquo; 
      my share of the work a bit, thought &lsquo;twould be kind of fun to swab decks
      and all that. Well, &lsquo;twas for a spell, but &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t now. I&rsquo;m so sick of it
      that I don&rsquo;t know what to do. And I&rsquo;m sick of livin&rsquo; in a pigpen, too.
      Look at them dead-lights! They&rsquo;re so dirty that when I turn out in the
      mornin&rsquo; and go to look through &lsquo;em, I can&rsquo;t tell whether it&rsquo;s foul weather
      or fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri looked at the windows toward which his friend pointed and
      signed assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to have a steward aboard
      this craft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Perez emphatically, &ldquo;a steward or a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A WOMAN!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Eri. Then he shook his head solemnly and
      added, &ldquo;There, Jerry! What did I tell you? M&rsquo;lissy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Perez did not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t foolin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry thought of the spick-and-span days of his wife, dead these
      twenty years, and sighed again. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose we might have a housekeeper,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Housekeeper!&rdquo; sneered Captain Eri. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d you hire? Perez don&rsquo;t,
      seemin&rsquo;ly, take to M&rsquo;lissy, and there ain&rsquo;t nobody else in Orham that you
      could git, &lsquo;less &lsquo;twas old A&rsquo;nt Zuby Higgins, and that would be actin&rsquo; 
      like the feller that jumped overboard when his boat sprung a leak. No,
      sir! If A&rsquo;nt Zuby ships aboard here I heave up MY commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said anything about A&rsquo;nt Zuby or housekeepers either?&rdquo; inquired
      Captain Perez. &ldquo;I said we&rsquo;d got to have a woman, and we have. One of us
      &lsquo;ll have to git married, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARRIED!&rdquo; roared the two in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said, married, and take the others to board in this house.
      Look here now! When a shipwrecked crew&rsquo;s starvin&rsquo; one of &lsquo;em has to be
      sacrificed for the good of the rest, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to do. One
      of us has got to git married for the benefit of the other two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri shouted hilariously. &ldquo;Good boy, Perez!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to be
      the first offerin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless it&rsquo;s my luck, Eri. We&rsquo;ll all three match for it, same as we do
      &lsquo;bout washin&rsquo; the dishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you goin&rsquo; to find a wife?&rdquo; asked Captain Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s jest what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to show you. I see how things was goin&rsquo;,
      and I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; this over for a consid&rsquo;rable spell. Hold on a
      minute till I overhaul my kit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the front bedroom, and through the open door they could see
      him turning over the contents of the chest with P. R. in brass nails on
      the lid. He scattered about him fish-lines, hooks, lead for sinkers,
      oilcloth jackets, whales&rsquo; teeth, and various other articles, and at length
      came back bearing a much-crumpled sheet of printed paper. This he spread
      out upon the dining table, first pushing aside the dishes to make room,
      and, after adjusting his spectacles, said triumphantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! There she is! The Nup-ti-al Chime. A Journal of Matrimony. I see a
      piece about it in the Herald the other day, and sent a dime for a sample
      copy. It&rsquo;s chock-full of advertisements from women that wants husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri put on his spectacles and hitched his chair up to the table.
      After giving the pages of the Nuptial Chime a hurried inspection, he
      remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be a strong runnin&rsquo; to &lsquo;vi-va-ci-ous brunettes&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;blondes with tender and romantic dispositions.&rsquo; Which of them kinds are
      you sufferin&rsquo; for, Perez? Oh, say! here&rsquo;s a lady that&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to heave
      herself away on a young and handsome bachelor with a income of ten
      thousand a year. Seems to me you ought to answer that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush up, Eri! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;d want to write to any of them in
      there. The thing for us to do would be to write out a advertisement of our
      own; tell what sort of woman we want, and then set back and wait for
      answers. Now, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri looked at the advocate of matrimony for a moment without
      speaking. Then he said: &ldquo;Do you really mean it, Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s a good idee,&rdquo; said that ancient mariner decisively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
      to do somethin&rsquo;, and this looks like the only sensible thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Eri&rsquo;s GOT to do it!&rdquo; asserted Captain Perez dogmatically. &ldquo;We agreed
      to stick together, and two to one&rsquo;s a vote. Come on now, Eri, we&rsquo;ll
      match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Eri!&rdquo; ordered Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to mutiny, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to the ship. Only,&rdquo; he added,
      with a quizzical glance at his companions, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got to be settled that
      the feller that&rsquo;s stuck can pick his wife, and don&rsquo;t have to marry unless
      he finds one that suits him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The others agreed to this stipulation, and Captain Perez, drawing a long
      breath, took a coin from his pocket, flipped it in the air and covered it,
      as it fell on the table, with a big hairy hand. Captain Eri did likewise;
      so did Captain Jerry. Then Captain Eri lifted his hand and showed the coin
      beneath; it was a head. Captain Jerry&rsquo;s was a tail. Under Captain Perez&rsquo; 
      hand lurked the hidden fate. The Captain&rsquo;s lips closed in a grim line.
      With a desperate glance at the others he jerked his hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The penny lay head uppermost. Captain Jerry was &ldquo;stuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri rose, glanced at his watch, and, taking his hat from the shelf
      where the dishes should have been, opened the door. Before he went out,
      however, he turned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez, you and Jerry can be fixin&rsquo; up the advertisement while I&rsquo;m gone.
      You can let me see it when I come back. I say, Jerry,&rdquo; he added to the
      &ldquo;sacrifice,&rdquo; who sat gazing at the pennies on the table in a sort of
      trance, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel bad about it. Why, when you come to think of it, it&rsquo;s
      a providence it turned out that way. Me and Perez are bachelors, and we&rsquo;d
      be jest green hands. But you&rsquo;re a able seaman, you know what it is to
      manage a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; groaned Captain Jerry lugubriously. &ldquo;Durn it, that&rsquo;s jest
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri was chuckling as, lantern in hand, he passed around the corner
      of the little white house on the way to the barn. He chuckled all through
      the harnessing of Daniel, the venerable white horse. He was still
      chuckling as, perched on the seat of the &ldquo;truck wagon,&rdquo; he rattled and
      shook out of the yard and turned into the sandy road that led up to the
      village. And an outsider, hearing these chuckles, and knowing what had
      gone before, might have inferred that perhaps Captain Eri did not view the
      &ldquo;matching&rdquo; and the matrimonial project with quite the deadly seriousness
      of the other two occupants of the house by the shore.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRAIN COMES IN
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is in Orham a self-appointed committee whose duty it is to see the
      train come in. The committeemen receive no salary for their services; the
      sole compensation is the pleasure derived from the sense of duty done.
      Rain, snow, or shine, the committee is on hand at the station&mdash;the
      natives, of course, call it the &ldquo;deepo&rdquo;&mdash;to consume borrowed tobacco
      and to favor Providence with its advice concerning the running of the
      universe. Also it discusses local affairs with fluency and more or less
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. &ldquo;Squealer&rdquo; Wixon, a lifelong member of this committee, was the first
      to sight Captain Eri as the latter strolled across the tracks into the
      circle of light from the station lamps. The Captain had moored Daniel to a
      picket in the fence over by the freight-house. He had heard the clock in
      the belfry of the Methodist church strike eight as he drove by that
      edifice, but he heard no whistle from the direction of the West Orham
      woods, so he knew that the down train would arrive at its usual time, that
      is, from fifteen to twenty minutes behind the schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; shouted Mr. Wixon with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Eri! Well, Cap,
      how&rsquo;s she headin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout no&rsquo;theast by no&rsquo;th,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;Runnin&rsquo; fair, but with
      lookout for wind ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t got a spare chaw nowheres about you, have you, Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; anxiously
      inquired &ldquo;Bluey&rdquo; Batcheldor. Mr. Batcheldor is called &ldquo;Bluey&rdquo; for the same
      reason that Mr. Wixon is called &ldquo;Squealer,&rdquo; and that reason has been
      forgotten for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri obligingly produced a black plug of smoking tobacco, and Mr.
      Batcheldor bit off two-thirds and returned the balance. After adjusting
      the morsel so that it might interfere in the least degree with his vocal
      machinery, he drawled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you ain&rsquo;t heard the news, Eri. Web Saunders has got his
      original-package license. It come on the noon mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain turned sharply toward the speaker. &ldquo;Is that a fact?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See it myself. So did Squealer and a whole lot more. Web was showin&rsquo; it
      round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jabez Smalley, a member of the committee whose
      standing was somewhat impaired, inasmuch as he went fishing occasionally
      and was, therefore, obliged to miss some of the meetings, &ldquo;what kind of a
      fit John Baxter would have now. He&rsquo;s been pretty nigh distracted ever
      sence Web started his billiard room, callin&rsquo; it a &lsquo;ha&rsquo;nt of sin&rsquo; and a
      whole lot more names. There ain&rsquo;t been a &lsquo;Come-Outers&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; &lsquo;sence I
      don&rsquo;t know when that he ain&rsquo;t pitched into that saloon. Now, when he hears
      that Web&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sell rum, he&rsquo;ll bust a biler sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The committee received this prophecy with an hilarious shout of approval
      and each member began to talk. Captain Eri took advantage of this
      simultaneous expression of opinion to walk away. He looked in at the
      window of the ticket-office, exchanged greetings with Sam Hardy, the
      stationmaster, and then leaned against the corner of the building furthest
      removed from Mr. Wixon and his friends, lit his pipe and puffed
      thoughtfully with a troubled expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the clump of blackness that indicated the beginning of the West Orham
      woods came a long-drawn dismal &ldquo;toot&rdquo;; then two shorter ones. The
      committee sprang to its feet and looked interested. Sam Hardy came out of
      the ticket office. The stage-driver, a sharp-looking boy of about
      fourteen, with a disagreeable air of cheap smartness sticking out all over
      him, left his seat in the shadow of Mr. Batcheldor&rsquo;s manly form, tossed a
      cigarette stump away and loafed over to the vicinity of the &ldquo;depot wagon,&rdquo;
       which was backed up against the platform. Captain Eri knocked the ashes
      from his pipe and put that service-stained veteran in his pocket. The
      train was really &ldquo;coming in&rdquo; at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this had been an August evening instead of a September one, both train
      and platform would have been crowded. But the butterfly summer maiden had
      flitted and, as is his wont, the summer man had flitted after her, so the
      passengers who alighted from the two coaches that, with the freight car,
      made up the Orham Branch train, were few in number and homely in flavor.
      There was a very stout lady with a canvas extension case and an umbrella
      in one hand and a bulging shawl-strap and a pasteboard box in the other,
      who panted and wheezed like the locomotive itself and who asked the
      brakeman, &ldquo;What on airth DO they have such high steps for?&rdquo; There was a
      slim, not to say gawky, individual with a chin beard and rubber boots,
      whom the committee hailed as &ldquo;Andy&rdquo; and welcomed to its bosom. There were
      two young men, drummers, evidently, who nodded to Hardy, and seemed very
      much at home. Also, there was another young man, smooth-shaven and
      square-shouldered, who deposited a suit-case on the platform and looked
      about him with the air of being very far from home, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drummers and the stout lady got into the stage. The young man with the
      suit-case picked up the latter and walked toward the same vehicle. He
      accosted the sharp boy, who had lighted another cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you direct me to the cable station?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing!&rdquo; said the youth, and there was no Cape Cod twist to his
      accent. &ldquo;Git aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to ride,&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was you goin&rsquo; to do? Walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if it&rsquo;s not far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy grinned, and the members of the committee, who had been staring
      with all their might, grinned also. The young man&rsquo;s mention of the cable
      station seemed to have caused considerable excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t too FAR!&rdquo; said the stage-driver. Then he added: &ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re
      the new electrician, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man hesitated for a moment. Then he said, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and suggested,
      &ldquo;I asked the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two blocks to the right; that&rsquo;s the main road, keep on that for four
      blocks, then turn to the left, and if you keep on straight ahead you&rsquo;ll
      get to the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blocks?&rdquo; The stranger smiled. &ldquo;I think you must be from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; inquired the youthful prodigy, climbing to the wagon seat.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to keep straight ahead after you turn off the main road. Git
      dap! So long, fellers!&rdquo; He leaned over the wheel, as the stage turned, and
      bestowed a wink upon the delighted &ldquo;Squealer,&rdquo; who was holding one
      freckled paw over his mouth; then the &ldquo;depot wagon&rdquo; creaked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square-shouldered young man looked after the equipage with an odd
      expression of countenance. Then he shrugged his shoulders, picked up the
      suitcase, and walked off the platform into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wixon removed the hand from his mouth and displayed a mammoth grin,
      that grew into a shriek of laughter in which every member of the committee
      joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw! haw!&rdquo; bellowed &ldquo;Bluey,&rdquo; &ldquo;so that&rsquo;s the feller that done Parker out
      of his job! Well, he may be mighty smart, but if that Joe Bartlett ain&rsquo;t
      smarter then I&rsquo;m a skate, that&rsquo;s all! Smartest boy ever I see! &lsquo;If you
      keep on straight ahead you&rsquo;ll git to the station!&rsquo; Gosh! he&rsquo;ll have to
      wear rubbers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s web-footed,&rdquo; suggested Smalley, and they laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Captain Eri, with a dozen new, clean-smelling cranberry
      barrels in the wagon behind him, drove slowly down the &ldquo;depot road.&rdquo; It
      was a clear night, but there was no moon, and Orham was almost at its
      darkest, which is very dark, indeed. The &ldquo;depot road&rdquo;&mdash;please bear in
      mind that there are no streets in Orham&mdash;was full of ruts, and
      although Daniel knew his way and did his best to follow it, the cranberry
      barrels rattled and shook in lively fashion. There are few homes near the
      station, and the dwellers in them conscientiously refrain from showing
      lights except in the ends of the buildings furthest from the front.
      Strangers are inclined to wonder at this, but when they become better
      acquainted with the town and its people, they come to know that front
      gates and parlors are, by the majority of the inhabitants, restricted in
      their use to occasions such as a funeral, or, possibly, a wedding. For the
      average Orham family to sit in the parlor on a week evening would be an
      act bordering pretty closely on sacrilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is from the hill by the Methodist church that the visitor to Orham gets
      his best view of the village. It is all about him, and for the most part
      below him. At night the lights in the houses show only here and there
      through the trees, but those on the beaches and at sea shine out plainly.
      The brilliant yellow gleam a mile away is from the Orham lighthouse on the
      bluff. The smaller white dot marks the light on Baker&rsquo;s Beach. The tiny
      red speck in the distance, that goes and comes again, is the flash-light
      at Setuckit Point, and the twinkle on the horizon to the south is the
      beacon of the lightship on Sand Hill Shoal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is on his arrival at this point, too, that the stranger first notices
      the sound of the surf. Being a newcomer, he notices this at once; after he
      has been in the village a few weeks, he ceases to notice it at all. It is
      like the ticking of a clock, so incessant and regular, that one has to
      listen intently for a moment or two before his accustomed ear will single
      it out and make it definite. One low, steady, continuous roar, a little
      deeper in tone when the wind is easterly, the voice of the old dog Ocean
      gnawing with foaming mouth at the bone of the Cape and growling as he
      gnaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that the young man with the square shoulders and the suit-case
      had paused at the turn of the road by the church to listen to this song of
      the sea; at any rate he was there, and when Captain Eri steered Daniel and
      the cranberry barrels around the corner and into the &ldquo;main road,&rdquo; he
      stepped out and hailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m mixed in my directions. The
      stage-driver told me the way to the cable station, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten
      whether he said to turn to the right when I reached here, or to the left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri took his lantern from the floor of the wagon and held it up.
      He had seen the stranger when the latter left the train, but he had not
      heard the dialogue with Josiah Bartlett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was you cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to go to the station?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I intended to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell them fellers at the depot that you wanted to walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan! And they give you the direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; a little impatiently; &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t they? So many blocks till I
      got to the main street, or road, and so many more, till I got somewhere
      else, and then straight on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blocks, hey? That&rsquo;s Joe Bartlett. That boy ought to be mastheaded, and
      I&rsquo;ve told Perez so more&rsquo;n once. Well, Mister, I guess maybe you&rsquo;d better
      not try to walk to the cable station to-night. You see, there&rsquo;s one thing
      they forgot to tell you. The station&rsquo;s on the outer beach, and there&rsquo;s a
      ha&rsquo;f mile of pretty wet water between here and there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man whistled. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sartin do, unless there&rsquo;s been an almighty drought since I left the
      house. I tell you what! If you&rsquo;ll jump in here with me, and don&rsquo;t mind
      waitin&rsquo; till I leave these barrels at the house of the man that owns &lsquo;em,
      I&rsquo;ll drive you down to the shore and maybe find somebody to row you over.
      That is,&rdquo; with a chuckle, &ldquo;if you ain&rsquo;t dead set on walkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger laughed heartily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so stubborn as all that,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good of you, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Give us your satchel. Now your
      flipper! There you are! Git dap, Dan&rsquo;l!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daniel accepted the Captain&rsquo;s command in a tolerant spirit. He paddled
      along at a jog-trot for perhaps a hundred yards, and then, evidently
      feeling that he had done all that could be expected, settled back into a
      walk. The Captain turned towards his companion on the seat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I mentioned it,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;but my name is Hedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr. Hedge,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;My name is Hazeltine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kind of jedged it might be when you said you wanted to git to the cable
      station. We heard you was expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? From Mr. Langley, I presume.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, not d&rsquo;rectly. Of course, we knew Parker had been let go, and that
      somebody would have to take his place. I guess likely it was one of the
      operators that told it fust that you was the man, but anyhow it got as fur
      as M&rsquo;lissy Busteed, and after that &lsquo;twas plain sailin&rsquo;. You come from New
      York, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know how &lsquo;tis when a thing gits into the papers. Orham ain&rsquo;t
      big enough to have a paper of its own, so the Almighty give us M&rsquo;lissy, I
      jedge, as a sort of substitute. She can spread a little news over more
      country than anybody I know. If she spreads butter the same way, she could
      make money keepin&rsquo; boarders. Is this your fust visit to the Cape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I hardly know why I&rsquo;m here now. I have been with the Cable Company
      at their New York experimental station for some years, and the other day
      the General Manager called me into his office and told me I was expected
      to take the position of electrician here. I thought it might add to my
      experience, so I accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Did he say anything about the general liveliness of things around
      the station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazeltine laughed. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;now that you speak of it, I
      remember that he began by asking me if I had any marked objection to
      premature burial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain chuckled. &ldquo;The outer beach in winter ain&rsquo;t exactly a
      camp-meeting for sociableness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And the idea of that Bartlett
      boy tellin&rsquo; you how to walk there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a specimen of your Cape Cod youngsters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. He&rsquo;s a new shipment from New York. Grand-nephew of a
      messmate of mine, Cap&rsquo;n Perez Ryder. Perez, he&rsquo;s a bachelor, but his
      sister&rsquo;s daughter married a feller named Bartlett. Maybe you knew him; he
      used to run a tugboat in the Sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazeltine, much amused, denied the acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose you wouldn&rsquo;t, nat&rsquo;rally,&rdquo; continued the Captain. &ldquo;Anyhow,
      Perez&rsquo;s niece&rsquo;s husband died, and the boy sort of run loose, as yer might
      say. Went to school when he had to, and raised Ned when he didn&rsquo;t, near&rsquo;s
      I can find out. &lsquo;Lizabeth, that&rsquo;s his ma, died last spring, and she made
      Perez promise&mdash;he being the only relation the youngster had&mdash;to
      fetch the boy down here and sort of bring him up. Perez knows as much
      about bringing up a boy as a hen does about the Ten Commandments, and
      &lsquo;Lizabeth made him promise not to lick the youngster and a whole lot more
      foolishness. School don&rsquo;t commence here till October, so we got him a job
      with Lem Mullett at the liv&rsquo;ry stable. He&rsquo;s boardin&rsquo; with Lem till school
      opens. He ain&rsquo;t a reel bad boy, but he knows too much &lsquo;bout some things
      and not ha&rsquo;f enough &lsquo;bout others. You&rsquo;ve seen fellers like that, maybe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazeltine nodded. &ldquo;There are a good many of that kind in New York, I&rsquo;m
      afraid,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri smiled. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The boys down here
      think Josiah&rsquo;s the whole crew, and the girls ain&rsquo;t fur behind. There&rsquo;s
      been more deviltry in this village sence he landed than there ever was
      afore. He needs somethin&rsquo;, and needs it bad, but I ain&rsquo;t decided jest what
      it is yit. Are you a married man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here. Never had the disease. Perez, he&rsquo;s had symptoms every once in
      a while, but nothin&rsquo; lastin&rsquo;. Jerry&rsquo;s the only one of us three that&rsquo;s been
      through the mill. His wife died twenty year ago. I don&rsquo;t know as I told
      you, but Jerry and Perez and me are keepin&rsquo; house down by the shore. That
      is, we call it keepin&rsquo; house, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Captain broke off and seemed to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Hazeltine forbore to interrupt, and occupied himself by scrutinizing
      the buildings that they were passing. They were nearing the center of the
      town now, and the houses were closer together than they had been on the
      &ldquo;depot road,&rdquo; but never so close as to be in the least crowded. Each house
      had its ample front yard, and the new arrival could smell the box hedges
      and see, now and then, the whiteness of the kalsomined stones that
      bordered a driveway. It was too dark for the big seashells at the front
      steps to be visible, but they were there, all the same; every third house
      of respectability in Orham has them. There was an occasional shop, too,
      with signs like &ldquo;Cape Cod Variety Store,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Boston Dry Goods
      Emporium,&rdquo; over their doors. On the platform of one a small crowd was
      gathered, and from the interior came shouts of laughter and the sound of a
      tin-panny piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the billiard saloon,&rdquo; volunteered Captain Eri, suddenly waking
      from his trance. &ldquo;Play pool, Mr. Hazeltine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye play it with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, with a cue, generally speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so! Most of the fellers in there play it with their mouths. Miss a
      shot and then spend the rest of the evenin&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; how it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should care to play it that way,&rdquo; said Ralph, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has its good p&rsquo;ints. Kind of all-round exercise; develops the
      lungs and strengthens the muscles, as the patent-medicine almanac says.
      Parker played it considerable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judge that your opinion of my predecessor isn&rsquo;t a high one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Oh, Parker! He was all right in his way. Good many folks in this
      town swore by him. I understand the fellers over at the station thought he
      was about the ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Langley included?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Langley, bein&rsquo; manager, had his own ideas, I s&rsquo;pose! Langley
      don&rsquo;t play pool much; not at Web Saunders&rsquo; place, anyhow. We turn in
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rolled up a long driveway, very dark and overgrown with trees, and
      drew up at the back door of a good-sized two-story house. There was a
      light in the kitchen window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa, Dan&rsquo;l!&rdquo; commanded the Captain. Then he began to shout, &ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo;
       at the top of his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen door opened and a man came out, carrying a lamp, its light
      shining full upon his face. It was an old face, a stern face, with white
      eyebrows and a thin-lipped mouth. Just such a face as looked on with
      approval when the executioner held up the head of Charles I., at
      Whitehall. There was, however, a tremble about the chin that told of
      infirm health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, John!&rdquo; said Captain Eri heartily. &ldquo;John, let me make you
      acquainted with Mr. Hazeltine, the new man at the cable station. Mr.
      Hazeltine, this is my friend, Cap&rsquo;n John Baxter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two shook hands, and then Captain Eri said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, I brought down them barrels for you. Hawkins got &lsquo;em here, same as
      he always does, by the skin of his teeth. Stand by now, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve got to
      deliver Mr. Hazeltine at the station, and it&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Baxter said nothing, beyond thanking his friend for the good turn,
      but he &ldquo;stood by,&rdquo; as directed, and the barrels were quickly unloaded. As
      they were about to drive out of the yard, Captain Eri turned in his seat
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, guess I&rsquo;ll be up some time to-morrow. I want to talk with you about
      that billiard-room business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lamp in Baxter&rsquo;s hand shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God A&rsquo;mighty&rsquo;s got his eye on that place, Eri Hedge,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and on
      them that&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Then the job&rsquo;s in good hands, and
      we ain&rsquo;t got to worry. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of this assurance, Hazeltine noticed that his driver was
      silent and preoccupied until they reached the end of the road by the
      shore, when he brought the willing Daniel to a stand still and announced
      that it was time to &ldquo;change cars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a fifteen-minute row from the mainland to the outer beach, and
      Captain Eri made it on schedule time. Hazeltine protested that he was used
      to a boat, and could go alone and return the dory in the morning, but the
      Captain wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. The dory slid up on the sand and the
      passenger climbed out. The sound of the surf on the ocean side of the
      beach was no longer a steady roar, it was broken into splashing plunges
      and hisses with, running through it, a series of blows like those of a
      muffled hammer. The wind was wet and smelt salty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the station,&rdquo; said the Captain, pointing to a row of lighted
      windows a quarter of a mile away. &ldquo;It IS straight ahead this time, and the
      walkin&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n it has been for the last few minutes. Good-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electrician put his hand in his pocket, hesitated, and then withdrew
      it, empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much obliged to you for all this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have
      made your acquaintance, and I hope we shall see each other often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here!&rdquo; said the Captain heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely to git together once
      in a while, seein&rsquo; as we&rsquo;re next-door neighbors, right across the road, as
      you might say. That&rsquo;s my berth over yonder, where you see them lights.
      It&rsquo;s jest &lsquo;round the corner from the road we drove down last. Good-night!
      Good luck to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he settled himself for the row home.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE &ldquo;COME-OUTERS&rsquo;&rdquo; MEETING
    </h3>
    <p>
      The house where the three Captains lived was as near salt water as it
      could be and remain out of reach of the highest tides. When Captain Eri,
      after beaching and anchoring his dory and stabling Daniel for the night,
      entered the dining room he found his two messmates deep in consultation,
      and with evidences of strenuous mental struggle written upon their faces.
      Captain Perez&rsquo;s right hand was smeared with ink and there were several
      spatters of the same fluid on Captain Jerry&rsquo;s perspiring nose. Crumpled
      sheets of note paper were on the table and floor, and Lorenzo, who was
      purring restfully upon the discarded jackets of the two mariners, alone
      seemed to be enjoying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you fellers look as if you&rsquo;d had a rough v&rsquo;yage,&rdquo; commented Captain
      Eri, slipping out of his own jacket and pulling his chair up beside those
      of his friends. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh, Eri, I&rsquo;m glad to see you!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Perez, drawing the
      hand, just referred to, across his forehead and thereby putting that
      portion of his countenance into mourning. &ldquo;How do you spell
      conscientious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, unless it&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;What do you want
      to spell it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve writ much as four hundred advertisements, I do believe!&rdquo; said
      Captain Jerry, &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t one of them fit to feed to a pig. Perez
      here, he&rsquo;s got such hifalutin&rsquo; notions, that nothin&rsquo; less than a circus
      bill &lsquo;ll do him. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t see why somethin&rsquo; plain and sensible like
      &lsquo;Woman wanted to do dishes and clean house for three men,&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be all
      right; but no, it&rsquo;s got to have more fancy trimmin&rsquo;s than a Sunday bunnit.
      Foolishness, I call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have a whole lot of women answerin&rsquo; that advertisement, now
      wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; snorted Captain Perez hotly. &ldquo;&lsquo;To do dishes for three men!&rsquo; 
      That&rsquo;s a healthy bait to catch a wife with, ain&rsquo;t it? I can see &lsquo;em
      comin&rsquo;. I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d stay single till Jedgment, and then you wouldn&rsquo;t
      git one. No, sir! The thing to do is to be sort of soft-soapy and
      high-toned. Let &lsquo;em think they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to git a bargain when they git
      you. Make believe it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a privilege to git sech a husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; declared the sacrifice indignantly. &ldquo;They might git a
      dum-sight worse one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;s so, Jerry,&rdquo; said Captain Eri. &ldquo;Still, Perez ain&rsquo;t
      altogether wrong. Guess you&rsquo;d better keep the dishwashin&rsquo; out of it. I
      know dishwashin&rsquo; would never git ME; I&rsquo;ve got so I hate the sight of soap
      and hot water as bad as if I was a Portugee. Pass me that pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez gladly relinquished the writing materials, and Captain Eri,
      after two or three trials, by which he added to the paper decorations of
      the floor, produced the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife Wanted&mdash;By an ex-seafaring man of steady habbits. Must be
      willing to Work and Keep House shipshape and aboveboard. No sea-lawyers
      need apply. Address&mdash;Skipper, care the Nuptial Chime, Boston, Mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The line relating to sea-lawyers was insisted upon by Captain Jerry.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll shut out the tonguey kind,&rdquo; he explained. The advertisement, with
      this addition, being duly approved, the required fifty cents was inclosed,
      as was a letter to the editor of the matrimonial journal requesting all
      answers to be forwarded to Captain Jeremiah Burgess, Orham, Mass. Then the
      envelope was directed and the stamp affixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s done. All you&rsquo;ve got to do now, Jerry,
      is to pick out your wife and let us know what you want for a weddin&rsquo; 
      present. You&rsquo;re a lucky man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, let&rsquo;s talk about somethin&rsquo; else,&rdquo; said the lucky one rather gloomily.
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news up at the depot, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They received the tidings of the coming of Hazeltine with the interest due
      to such an event. Captain Eri gave them a detailed account of his meeting
      with the new electrician, omitting, however, in consideration for the
      feelings of Captain Perez, to mention the fact that it was the Bartlett
      boy who started that gentleman upon his walk to the cable station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did you think of him?&rdquo; asked Captain Perez, when the recital
      was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seemed to me like a pretty good feller,&rdquo; answered Captain Eri
      deliberately. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t git mad at the joke the gang played on him, for
      one thing. He ain&rsquo;t so smooth-tongued as Parker used to be and he didn&rsquo;t
      treat Baxter and me as if Cape Codders was a kind of animals, the way some
      of the summer folks do. He had the sense not to offer to pay me for takin&rsquo; 
      him over to the station, and I liked that. Take it altogether, he seemed
      like a pretty decent chap&mdash;for a New Yorker,&rdquo; he added, as an after
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But say,&rdquo; he said a moment later, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some more news and it ain&rsquo;t
      good news, either. Web Saunders has got his liquor license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me!&rdquo; said Captain Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both said, &ldquo;What will John Baxter do now?&rdquo; And Captain Eri shook
      his head dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cod bit well next morning and Captain Eri did not get in from the
      Windward Ledge until afternoon. By the way, it may be well to explain that
      Captain Jerry&rsquo;s remarks concerning &ldquo;settlin&rsquo; down&rdquo; and &ldquo;restin&rsquo;,&rdquo; which we
      chronicled in the first chapter must not be accepted too literally. While
      it is true that each of the trio had given up long voyages, it is equally
      true that none had given up work entirely. Some people might not consider
      it restful to rise at four every weekday morning and sail in a catboat
      twelve miles out to sea and haul a wet cod line for hours, not to mention
      the sail home and the cleaning and barreling of the catch. Captain Eri did
      that. Captain Perez was what he called &ldquo;stevedore&rdquo;&mdash;that is, general
      caretaker during the owner&rsquo;s absence, at Mr. Delancy Barry&rsquo;s summer estate
      on the &ldquo;cliff road.&rdquo; As for Captain Jerry, he was janitor at the
      schoolhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The catch was heavy the next morning, as has been said, and by the time
      the last fish was split and iced and the last barrel sent to the railway
      station it was almost supper time. Captain Eri had intended calling on
      Baxter early in the day, but now he determined to wait until after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain had bad luck in the &ldquo;matching&rdquo; that followed the meal, and it
      was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock before he finished washing dishes. This
      distasteful task being completed, he set out for the Baxter homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s views on the liquor question were broader than those of many
      Orham citizens. He was an abstainer, generally speaking, but his scruples
      were not as pronounced as those of Miss Abigail Mullett, whose proudest
      boast was that she had refused brandy when the doctor prescribed it as the
      stimulant needed to save her life. Over and over again has Miss Abigail
      told it in prayer-meeting; how she &ldquo;riz up&rdquo; in her bed, &ldquo;expectin&rsquo; every
      breath to be the last&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Dr. Palmer, if it&rsquo;s got to be liquor or
      death, then death referred to!&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, it is fair to presume, that
      death was preferred rather than the brandy. With much more concerning her
      miraculous recovery through the aid of a &ldquo;terbacker and onion poultice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On general principles the Captain objected to the granting of a license to
      a fellow like &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders, but it was the effect that this action of
      the State authorities might have upon his friend John Baxter that troubled
      him most.
    </p>
    <p>
      For forty-five years John Baxter was called by Cape Cod people &ldquo;as smart a
      skipper as ever trod a plank.&rdquo; He saved money, built an attractive home
      for his wife and daughter, and would, in the ordinary course of events,
      have retired to enjoy a comfortable old age. But his wife died shortly
      after the daughter&rsquo;s marriage to a Boston man, and on a voyage to Manila,
      Baxter himself suffered from a sunstroke and a subsequent fever, that left
      him a physical wreck and for a time threatened to unsettle his reason. He
      recovered a portion of his health and the threatened insanity disappeared,
      except for a religious fanaticism that caused him to accept the Bible
      literally and to interpret it accordingly. When his daughter and her
      husband were drowned in the terrible City of Belfast disaster, it is an
      Orham tradition that John Baxter, dressed in gunny-bags and sitting on an
      ash-heap, was found by his friends mourning in what he believed to be the
      Biblical &ldquo;sackcloth and ashes.&rdquo; His little baby granddaughter had been
      looked out for by some kind friends in Boston. Only Captain Eri knew that
      John Baxter&rsquo;s yearly trip to Boston was made for the purpose of visiting
      the girl who was his sole reminder of the things that might have been, but
      even the Captain did not know that the money that paid her board and, as
      she grew older, for her gowns and schooling, came from the bigoted, stern
      old hermit, living alone in the old house at Orham.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Orham, and in other sections of the Cape as well, there is a sect
      called by the ungodly, &ldquo;The Come-Outers.&rdquo; They were originally seceders
      from the Methodist churches who disapproved of modern innovations. They
      &ldquo;come out&rdquo; once a week to meet at the houses of the members, and theirs
      are lively meetings. John Baxter was a &ldquo;Come-Outer,&rdquo; and ever since the
      enterprising Mr. Saunders opened his billiard room, the old man&rsquo;s tirades
      of righteous wrath had been directed against this den of iniquity. Since
      it became known that &ldquo;Web&rdquo; had made application for the license, it was a
      regular amusement for the unregenerate to attend the gatherings of the
      &ldquo;Come-Outers&rdquo; and hear John Baxter call down fire from Heaven upon the
      billiard room, its proprietor, and its patrons. Orham people had begun to
      say that John Baxter was &ldquo;billiard-saloon crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And John Baxter was Captain Eri&rsquo;s friend, a friendship that had begun in
      school when the declaimer of Patrick Henry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liberty or Death&rdquo; speech on
      Examination Day took a fancy to and refused to laugh at the little chap
      who tremblingly ventured to assert that he loved &ldquo;little Pussy, her coat
      is so warm.&rdquo; The two had changed places until now it was Captain Eri who
      protected and advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Captain rapped at John Baxter&rsquo;s kitchen door no one answered,
      and, after yelling &ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; through the keyhole a number of times, he
      was forced to the conclusion that his friend was not at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lookin&rsquo; fer Cap&rsquo;n Baxter?&rdquo; queried Mrs. Sarah Taylor, who lived just
      across the road. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to Come-Outers&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;, I guess. There&rsquo;s one
      up to Barzilla Small&rsquo;s to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barzilla Small lived in that part of the village called &ldquo;down to the
      neck,&rdquo; and when the Captain arrived there, he found the parlor filled with
      the devout, who were somewhat surprised to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how do you do?&rdquo; said Mrs. Small, resplendent in black &ldquo;alpaca&rdquo; and
      wearing her jet earrings. &ldquo;I snum if you ain&rsquo;t a stranger! We&rsquo;ll have a
      reel movin&rsquo; meetin&rsquo; to-night because Mr. Perley&rsquo;s here, and he says he
      feels the sperrit a-workin&rsquo;. Set right down there by the what-not.
      Luther,&rdquo; to her oldest but three, &ldquo;give Cap&rsquo;n Hedge your chair. You can
      set on the cricket. Yes, you can! Don&rsquo;t answer back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, ma!&rdquo; burst out the indignant Luther, &ldquo;how d&rsquo;yer think I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
      set on that cricket? My laigs &lsquo;ll be way up under my chin. Make Hart set
      on it; he&rsquo;s shorter&rsquo;n me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t nuther, Lute Small!&rdquo; declared Hartwell, a freckle-faced youngster,
      who was the next step downward in the family stair of children. &ldquo;Set on it
      yourself. Make him, ma, now! You said he&rsquo;d have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, ma, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, both of you! I sh&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d be ashamed, with everybody here
      so! Oh, my soul and body!&rdquo; turning to the company, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t enough to
      try a saint! Sometimes seems&rsquo;s if I SHOULD give up. You be thankful,
      Abigail,&rdquo; to Miss Mullett, who sat by the door, &ldquo;that you ain&rsquo;t got nine
      in a family and nobody to help teach &lsquo;em manners. If Barzilla was like
      most men, he&rsquo;d have some dis-CIP-line in the house; but no, I have to do
      it all, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Small, thus publicly rebuked, rose from his seat in the corner by the
      melodeon and proclaimed in a voice that he tried hard not to make
      apologetic:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Luther, if I was you I&rsquo;d be a good boy and mind ma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even this awe-inspiring command had little effect upon the reluctant
      Luther, but Captain Eri, who, smiling and bowing right and left, had been
      working his passage to the other side of the room, announced that he was
      all right and would &ldquo;squeeze in on the sofy &lsquo;side of Cap&rsquo;n Baxter.&rdquo; So
      there was peace once more, that is, as much peace as half a dozen feminine
      tongues, all busy with different subjects, would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eri&rdquo; whispered John Baxter, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here. I&rsquo;m
      glad, though; Lord knows every God-fearin&rsquo; man in this town has need to be
      on his knees this night. Have you heard about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n John means about the rum-sellin&rsquo; license that Web Saunders has
      got,&rdquo; volunteered Miss Melissa Busteed, leaning over from her seat in the
      patent rocker that had been the premium earned by Mrs. Small for selling
      one hundred and fifty pounds of tea for a much-advertised house. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it
      awful? I says to Prissy Baker this mornin&rsquo;, soon &lsquo;s I heard of it,
      &lsquo;Prissy,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I, &lsquo;there &lsquo;ll be a jedgment on this town sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re a
      livin&rsquo; woman,&rsquo; s&rsquo; I. Says she, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s so, M&rsquo;lissy,&rsquo; s&rsquo; she, and I says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, when Miss Busteed talks, interruptions are futile, so Captain Eri
      sat silent, as the comments of at least one-tenth of the population of
      Orham were poured into his ears. The recitation was cut short by Mrs.
      Small&rsquo;s vigorous pounding on the center table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re blessed this evenin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the hostess with emotion, &ldquo;in havin&rsquo; 
      Mr. Perley with us. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to lead the meetin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Mr. Perley&mdash;Reverend by courtesy; he had never been
      ordained&mdash;stood up, cleared his throat with vigor, rose an inch or
      two on the toes of a very squeaky pair of boots, sank to heel level again
      and announced that everyone would join in singing, &ldquo;Hymn number one
      hundred and ten, omitting the second and fourth stanzas: hymn number one
      hundred and ten, second and fourth stanzas omitted.&rdquo; The melodeon,
      tormented by Mrs. Lurania Bassett, shrieked and groaned, and the hymn was
      sung. So was another, and yet another. Then Mr. Perley squeaked to his
      tiptoes again, subsided, and began a lengthy and fervent discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perley had been a blacksmith in Ostable before he &ldquo;got religion,&rdquo; and
      now spent the major portion of his time in &ldquo;boardin&rsquo; &lsquo;round&rdquo; with
      &ldquo;Come-Outers&rdquo; up and down the Cape and taking part in their meetings. His
      services at such gatherings paid for his food and lodging. He had been a
      vigorous horseshoer in the old days; now he preached just as vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of the faithful few here gathered together. He spoke of the
      scoffing of those outside the pale and hinted at the uncomfortable future
      that awaited them. He ran over the various denominations one by one, and
      one by one showed them to be worshipers of idols and followers after
      strange gods. He sank hoarsely into the bass and quavered up into falsetto
      and a chorus of &ldquo;Amens!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallelujahs!&rdquo; followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, brothers and sisters!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;here we are a-kneelin&rsquo; at the
      altar&rsquo;s foot and what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on outside? Why, the Devil&rsquo;s got his
      clutches in our midst. The horn of the wicked is exalted. They&rsquo;re sellin&rsquo; 
      rum&mdash;RUM&mdash;in this town! They&rsquo;re a-sellin&rsquo; rum and drinkin&rsquo; of it
      and gloryin&rsquo; in their shame. But the Lord ain&rsquo;t asleep! He&rsquo;s got his eye
      on &lsquo;em! He&rsquo;s watchin&rsquo; &lsquo;em! And some of these fine days he&rsquo;ll send down
      fire out of Heaven and wipe &lsquo;em off the face of the earth!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Amen! Glory!
      Glory! Glory!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baxter was on his feet, his lean face working, the perspiration
      shining on his forehead, his eyes gleaming like lamps under his rough
      white eyebrows, and his clenched fists pounding the back of the chair in
      front of him. His hallelujahs were the last to cease. Captain Eri had to
      use some little force to pull him down on the sofa again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Small struck up, &ldquo;Oh, brother, have you heard?&rdquo; and they sang it
      with enthusiasm. Next, Miss Mullett told her story of the brandy and the
      defiance of the doctor. Nobody seemed much interested except a nervous
      young man with sandy hair and a celluloid collar, who had come with Mr.
      Tobias Wixon and was evidently a stranger. He had not heard it before and
      seemed somewhat puzzled when Miss Abigail repeated the &ldquo;Death referred to&rdquo;
       passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more singing. Mrs. Small &ldquo;testified.&rdquo; So did Barzilla, with many
      hesitations and false starts and an air of relief when it was over. Then
      another hymn and more testimony, each speaker denouncing the billiard
      saloon. Then John Baxter arose and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by saying that the people of Orham had been slothful in the
      Lord&rsquo;s vineyard. They had allowed weeds to spring up and wax strong. They
      had been tried and found wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, brothers and sisters,&rdquo; he declaimed, leaning over the chair
      back and shaking a thin forefinger in Mr. Perley&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;God has given us
      a task to do and how have we done it? We&rsquo;ve set still and let the Devil
      have his way. We&rsquo;ve talked and talked, but what have we done? Nothin&rsquo;!
      Nothin&rsquo; at all; and now the grip of Satan is tighter on the town than it
      ever has been afore. The Lord set us a watch to keep and we&rsquo;ve slept on
      watch. And now there&rsquo;s a trap set for every young man in this c&rsquo;munity. Do
      you think that that hell-hole down yonder is goin&rsquo; to shut up because we
      talk about it in meetin&rsquo;? Do you think Web Saunders is goin&rsquo; to quit
      sellin&rsquo; rum because we say he ought to? Do you think God&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to walk
      up to that door and nail it up himself? No, sir! He don&rsquo;t work that way!
      We&rsquo;ve talked and talked, and now it&rsquo;s time to DO. Ain&rsquo;t there anybody here
      that feels a call? Ain&rsquo;t there axes to chop with and fire to burn? I tell
      you, brothers, we&rsquo;ve waited long enough! I&mdash;old as I am&mdash;am
      ready. Lord, here I am! Here I am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swayed, broke into a fit of coughing, and sank back upon the sofa,
      trembling all over and still muttering that he was ready. There was a
      hushed silence for a moment or two, and then a storm of hallelujahs and
      shouts. Mr. Perley started another hymn, and it was sung with tremendous
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just behind the nervous young man with the celluloid collar sat a stout
      individual with a bald head. This was Abijah Thompson, known by the
      irreverent as &ldquo;Barking&rdquo; Thompson, a nickname bestowed because of his
      peculiar habit of gradually puffing up, like a frog, under religious
      excitement, and then bursting forth in an inarticulate shout,
      disconcerting to the uninitiated. During Baxter&rsquo;s speech and the singing
      of the hymn his expansive red cheeks had been distended like balloons, and
      his breath came shorter and shorter. Mr. Perley had arisen and was holding
      up his hand for silence, when with one terrific &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Barking&rdquo;
       Thompson&rsquo;s spiritual exaltation exploded directly in the ear of the
      nervous stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shot out of his chair as if Mr. Thompson had fired a
      dynamite charge beneath him. &ldquo;Oh, the Devil!&rdquo; he shrieked, and then
      subsided, blushing to the back of his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow this interruption took the spirit out of the meeting. Giggles from
      Luther and the younger element interfered with the solemnity of Mr.
      Perley&rsquo;s closing remarks, and no one else was brave enough to &ldquo;testify&rdquo;
       under the circumstances. They sang again, and the meeting broke up. The
      nervous young man was the first one to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri got his friend out of the clutches of the &ldquo;Come-Outers&rdquo; as
      quickly as possible, and piloted him down the road toward his home. John
      Baxter was silent and absent-minded, and most of the Captain&rsquo;s cheerful
      remarks concerning Orham affairs in general went unanswered. As they
      turned in at the gate the elder man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri, do you believe that man&rsquo;s law ought to be allowed to interfere with
      God&rsquo;s law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, John, in most cases it&rsquo;s my jedgment that it pays to steer pretty
      close to both of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose God called you to break man&rsquo;s law and keep His; what would you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess the fust thing would be to make sure &lsquo;twas the Almighty that was
      callin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to say nothin&rsquo; to hurt your feelin&rsquo;s, but I should
      advise the feller that thought that he had that kind of a call to &lsquo;beware
      of imitations,&rsquo; as the soap folks advertise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri, I&rsquo;ve got a call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, John Baxter, you listen. You and me have been sailin&rsquo; together, as
      you might say, for forty odd years. I ain&rsquo;t a religious man &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to
      your way of thinkin&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;ve generally found that the Lord runs things
      most as well as us folks could run &lsquo;em. When there&rsquo;s a leak at one end of
      the schooner it don&rsquo;t pay to bore a hole at the other end to let the water
      out. Don&rsquo;t you worry no more about Web Saunders and that billiard saloon.
      The s&rsquo;lectmen &lsquo;ll attend to them afore very long. Why don&rsquo;t you go up to
      Boston for a couple of weeks? &lsquo;Twill do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Eri? Well, maybe &lsquo;twould&mdash;maybe &lsquo;twould. Sometimes
      I feel as if my head was kind of wearin&rsquo; out. I&rsquo;ll think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not think any more; better go right ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, next day, &ldquo;seems to me some kinds of religion
      is like whisky, mighty bad for a weak head. I wish somebody &lsquo;d invent a
      gold cure for Come-Outers.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A PICTURE SENT AND A CABLE TESTED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Something over a fortnight went by and the three captains had received no
      answers from the advertisement in the Nuptial Chime. The suspense affected
      each of them in a different manner. Captain Jerry was nervous and
      apprehensive. He said nothing, and asked no questions, but it was
      noticeable that he was the first to greet the carrier of the &ldquo;mail box&rdquo;
       when that individual came down the road, and, as the days passed and
      nothing more important than the Cape Cod Item and a patent-medicine
      circular came to hand, a look that a suspicious person might have deemed
      expressive of hope began to appear in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez, on the contrary, grew more and more disgusted with the
      delay. He spent a good deal of time wondering why there were no replies,
      and he even went so far as to suggest writing to the editor of the Chime.
      He was disposed to lay the blame upon Captain Eri&rsquo;s advertisement, and
      hinted that the latter was not &ldquo;catchy&rdquo; enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, alone of the trio, got any amusement out of the situation. He
      pretended to see in Captain Jerry an impatient bridegroom and administered
      comfort in large doses by suggesting that, in all probability, there had
      been so many replies that it had been found necessary to charter a
      freight-car to bring them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Jerry!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough on you, I know, but think of all
      them poor sufferin&rsquo; females that&rsquo;s settin&rsquo; up nights and worryin&rsquo; for fear
      they won&rsquo;t be picked out. Why, say, when you make your ch&rsquo;ice you&rsquo;ll have
      to let the rest know right off; &lsquo;twould be cruelty to animals not to. You
      ought to put &lsquo;em out of their misery quick&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry&rsquo;s laugh was almost dismal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first batch of answers from the Chime came by an evening mail. Captain
      Eri happened to beat the post-office that night and brought them home
      himself. They filled three of his pockets to overflowing, and he dumped
      them by handfuls on the dining table, under the nose of the pallid Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I tell you, Jerry?&rdquo; he crowed. &ldquo;I knew they was on the way. What
      have you got to say about my advertisement now, Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were twenty-six letters altogether. It was surprising how many women
      were willing, even anxious, to ally themselves with &ldquo;an ex-seafaring man
      of steady habbits.&rdquo; But most of the applicants were of unsatisfactory
      types. As Captain Perez expressed it, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too many of them
      everlastin&rsquo; &lsquo;blondes&rsquo; and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one note, however, that even Captain Eri was disposed to
      consider seriously. It was postmarked Nantucket, was written on half a
      sheet of blue-lined paper, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MR. SKIPPER:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir: I saw your advertisements in the paper and think perhaps you might
      suit me. Please answer these questions by return mail. What is your
      religious belief? Do you drink liquor? Are you a profane man? If you want
      to, you might send me your real name and a photograph. If I think you will
      suit maybe we might sign articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARTHA B. SNOW. &ldquo;NANTUCKET, MASS.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I like about that is the shipshape way she puts it,&rdquo; commented
      Captain Perez. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t say that she &lsquo;jest adores the ocean.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s mighty handy about takin&rsquo; hold and bossin&rsquo; things; there ain&rsquo;t no
      doubt of that,&rdquo; said Captain Eri. &ldquo;Notice it&rsquo;s us that&rsquo;s got to suit her,
      not her us. I kind of like that &lsquo;signin&rsquo; articles,&rsquo; too. You bet she&rsquo;s
      been brought up in a seagoin&rsquo; family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to know a Jubal Snow that hailed from Nantucket,&rdquo; suggested Perez;
      &ldquo;maybe she&rsquo;s some of his folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely,&rdquo; sniffed Captain Jerry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more Snows in Nantucket
      than you can shake a stick at. You can&rsquo;t heave a rock without hittin&rsquo; 
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve she&rsquo;s jest the kind we want,&rdquo; said Captain Perez with
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Jerry?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be the lucky
      man, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. What&rsquo;s the use of hurryin&rsquo;? More &lsquo;n likely the next lot
      of letters &lsquo;ll have somethin&rsquo; better yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s jest like you, Jerry Burgess!&rdquo; exclaimed Perez disgustedly.
      &ldquo;Want to put off and put off and put off. And the house gittin&rsquo; more like
      the fo&rsquo;castle on a cattleboat every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve myself you&rsquo;d do much better, Jerry,&rdquo; said Captain Eri
      seriously. &ldquo;I like that letter somehow. Seems to me it&rsquo;s worth a try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right! Have it your own way. Of course, <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t got
      nothin&rsquo; to say. I&rsquo;m only the divilish fool that&rsquo;s got to git married and
      keep boarders; that&rsquo;s all <i>I</i> am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful! She asked if you was a profane man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, shut up! You fellers are enough to make a minister swear. <i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t care what you do. Go ahead and write to her if you want to, only I
      give you fair warnin&rsquo;, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have her if she don&rsquo;t suit. I
      ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to marry no scarecrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between them, and with much diplomacy, they soothed the indignant
      candidate for matrimony until he agreed to sign his name to a letter to
      the Nantucket lady. Then Captain Perez said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I say, Jerry; she wants your picture. Have you got one to send her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that daguerreotype I had took when I was married afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rummaged it out of his chest and displayed it rather proudly. It showed
      him as a short, sandy-haired youth, whose sunburned face beamed from the
      depths of an enormous choker, and whose head was crowned with a tall,
      flat-brimmed silk hat of a forgotten style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose that might do,&rdquo; said Cap&rsquo;n Perez hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! &lsquo;Twill HAVE to do, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s got,&rdquo; said Captain Eri. &ldquo;Good
      land!&rdquo; he chuckled; &ldquo;look at that hat! Say, Jerry, she&rsquo;ll think you done
      your seafarin&rsquo; in Noah&rsquo;s ark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Jerry was oblivious to sarcasm just then. He was gazing at the
      daguerreotype in a sentimental sort of way, blowing the dust from the
      glass, and tilting it up and down so as to bring it to the most effective
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swan!&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve looked at that afore. I
      remember when I bought that hat, jest as well. Took care of it and brushed
      it&mdash;my! my! I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s somewheres around now. I thought I
      was jest about the ticket then, and&mdash;and I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t BAD lookin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s
      a fact!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last with a burst of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho! Perez,&rdquo; roared Captain Eri; &ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s fallin&rsquo; in love with his own
      picture. Awful thing for one so young, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t such a turrible sight older &lsquo;n you be, Eri Hedge,&rdquo; sputtered the
      prospective bridegroom with righteous indignation. Then he added in a
      rather crestfallen tone, &ldquo;But I am a heap older &lsquo;n I was when I had that
      daguerreotype took. See here; if I send that Nantucket woman this picture
      won&rsquo;t she notice the difference when she sees me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if she does?&rdquo; broke in Captain Perez. &ldquo;You can tell her how &lsquo;twas.
      Talk her over. A feller that&rsquo;s been married, like you, ought to be able to
      talk ANY woman over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry didn&rsquo;t appear sanguine concerning his ability to &ldquo;talk her
      over,&rdquo; but his fellow-conspirators made light of his feeble objections,
      and the daguerreotype, carefully wrapped, was mailed the next morning,
      accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of the original and his avowed
      adherence to the Baptist creed and the Good Templar&rsquo;s abstinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;ll hurry up and answer,&rdquo; said the impatient Captain Perez. &ldquo;I
      want to get this thing settled one way or another. Don&rsquo;t you, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the hesitating reply. &ldquo;One way or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri had seen John Baxter several times since the evening of the
      &ldquo;Come-Outers&rsquo;&rdquo; meeting. The old man was calmer apparently, and was
      disposed to take the billiard-saloon matter less seriously, particularly
      as it was reported that the town selectmen were to hold a special meeting
      to consider the question of allowing Mr. Saunders to continue in business.
      The last-named gentleman had given what he was pleased to call a
      &ldquo;blow-out&rdquo; to his regular patrons in celebration of the granting of the
      license, and &ldquo;Squealer&rdquo; Wixon and one or two more spent a dreary day and
      night in the town lock-up in consequence. Baxter told the Captain that he
      had not yet made up his mind concerning the proposed Boston trip, but he
      thought &ldquo;more &lsquo;n likely&rdquo; he should go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri was obliged to be content with this assurance, but he
      determined to keep a close watch on his friend just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had met Ralph Hazeltine once or twice since the latter&rsquo;s arrival in
      Orham, and, in response to questions as to how he was getting on at the
      station, the new electrician invariably responded, &ldquo;First-rate.&rdquo; Gossip,
      however, in the person of Miss Busteed, reported that the operators were
      doing their best to keep Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s lot from being altogether a bed
      of roses, and there were dark hints of something more to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning following the receipt of the letter from the Nantucket
      lady, Captain Eri was busy at his fish shanty, putting his lines in order
      and sewing a patch on the mainsail of his catboat. These necessary repairs
      had prevented his taking the usual trip to the fishing grounds. Looking up
      from his work, he saw, through the open door, Ralph Hazeltine just
      stepping out of the cable-station skiff. He tucked his sail needle into
      the canvas and hailed the young man with a shouted &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge?&rdquo; said Hazeltine, walking toward the shanty.
      &ldquo;Good weather, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tip-top. Long &lsquo;s the wind stays westerly and there ain&rsquo;t no Sunday-school
      picnics on, we don&rsquo;t squabble with the weather folks. The only thing that
      &lsquo;ll fetch a squall with a westerly wind is a Sunday-school picnic. That
      &lsquo;ll do it, sure as death. Busy over across?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty busy just now. The cable parted day before yesterday, and I&rsquo;ve
      been getting things ready for the repair ship. She was due this morning,
      and we&rsquo;re likely to hear from her at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Cable broke, hey? Now it&rsquo;s a queer thing, but I&rsquo;ve never
      been inside that station since &lsquo;twas built. Too handy, I guess. I&rsquo;ve got a
      second cousin up in Charlestown, lived there all his life, and he&rsquo;s never
      been up in Bunker Hill monument yit. Fust time I landed in Boston I dug
      for that monument, and I can tell you how many steps there is in it to
      this day. If that cable station was fifty mile off I&rsquo;d have been through
      it two weeks after it started up, but bein&rsquo; jest over there, I ain&rsquo;t ever
      done it. Queer, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to go over with me. I&rsquo;m going up to the post-office,
      and when I come back I should be glad of your company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s kind of you. I cal&rsquo;late I will. You might sing out as
      you go past. I&rsquo;ve got a ha&rsquo;f-hour job on this sail and then it&rsquo;s my watch
      below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cable station at Orham is a low whitewashed building with many
      windows. The vegetation about it is limited exclusively to &ldquo;beach grass&rdquo;
       and an occasional wild-plum bush. The nearest building which may be
      reached without a boat is the life-saving station, two miles below. The
      outer beach changes its shape every winter. The gales tear great holes in
      its sides, and then, as if in recompense, throw up new shoals and build
      new promontories. From the cable-station doorway in fair weather may be
      counted the sails of over one hundred vessels going and coming between
      Boston and New York. They come and go, and, alas! sometimes stop by the
      way. Then the life-saving crews are busy and the Boston newspapers report
      another wreck. All up and down the outer beach are the sun-whitened bones
      of schooners and ships; and all about them, and partially covering them,
      is sand, sand, sand, as white and much coarser than granulated sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazeltine&rsquo;s post-office trip and other errands had taken much more time
      than he anticipated, and more than two hours had gone by before he called
      for Captain Eri. During the row to the beach the electrician explained to
      the Captain the processes by which a break in the cable is located and
      repaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as soon as the line breaks we set about finding where
      it is broken. To do this we use an instrument called the Wheatstone
      bridge. In this case the break is about six hundred miles from the
      American shore. The next thing is to get at the company&rsquo;s repair ship. She
      lies, usually, at Halifax when she isn&rsquo;t busy, and that is where she was
      this time. We wired her and she left for the spot immediately. It was up
      to me to get ready the testing apparatus&mdash;we generally set up special
      instruments for testing. Judging by the distance, the ship should have
      been over the break early this morning. She will grapple for the broken
      cable ends, and as soon as she catches our end she&rsquo;ll send us a message.
      It&rsquo;s simple enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like takin&rsquo; wormwood tea&mdash;easy enough if you&rsquo;ve been brought up that
      way. I think I&rsquo;d make more money catchin&rsquo; codfish, myself,&rdquo; commented the
      Captain dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed. &ldquo;Well, it really is a very simple matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
      only thing we have to be sure of is that our end of the line is ready by
      the time the ship reaches the break. If the weather is bad the ship can&rsquo;t
      work, and so, when she does work, she works quick. I had my instruments in
      condition yesterday, so we&rsquo;re all right this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They landed at the little wharf and plodded through the heavy sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dismal-looking place, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Hazeltine, as he opened the back
      door of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know; it has its good p&rsquo;ints,&rdquo; replied his companion. &ldquo;Your
      neighbors&rsquo; hens don&rsquo;t scratch up your garden, for one thing. What do you
      do in here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the room where we receive and send. This is the receiver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain noticed with interest the recorder, with its two brass
      supports and the little glass tube, half filled with ink, that, when the
      cable was working, wrote the messages upon the paper tape traveling
      beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nigh as finicky as a watch, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fully as delicate in its way. Do you see this little screw on the
      centerpiece? Turn that a little, one way or the other, and the operator on
      the other side might send until doomsday, we wouldn&rsquo;t know it. I&rsquo;ll show
      you the living rooms and the laboratory now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door at the other end of the room opened, and a man, whom
      Captain Eri recognized as one of the operators, came in. He started when
      he saw Hazeltine and turned to go out again. Ralph spoke to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peters,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where is Mr. Langley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the fellow gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. Tell me where Mr. Langley is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is. He went over to the village a while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the rest of the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impudence and thinly veiled hostility in the man&rsquo;s tone were
      unmistakable. Hazeltine hesitated, seemed about to speak, and then
      silently led the way to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the laboratory later on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up to the
      testing room now.&rdquo; Then he added, apparently as much to himself as to his
      visitor, &ldquo;I told those fellows that I wouldn&rsquo;t be back until noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a door at the top of the stairs. Ralph opened this quietly. As
      they passed through, Captain Eri noticed that Peters had followed them
      into the hall and stood there, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper hall had a straw matting on the floor. There was another door at
      the end of the passage, and this was ajar. Toward it the electrician
      walked rapidly. From the room behind the door came a shout of laughter;
      then someone said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better give it another turn, hadn&rsquo;t I, to make sure? If two turns fixes
      it so we don&rsquo;t hear for a couple of hours, another one ought to shut it up
      for a week. That&rsquo;s arithmetic, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laugh that followed this was cut short by Hazeltine&rsquo;s throwing the
      door wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, close at the electrician&rsquo;s heels, saw a long room, empty save
      for a few chairs and a table in the center. Upon this table stood the
      testing instruments, exactly like those in the receiving room downstairs.
      Three men lounged in the chairs, and standing beside the table, with his
      fingers upon the regulating screw at the centerpiece of the recorder, was
      another, a big fellow, with a round, smooth-shaven face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men in the chairs sprang to their feet as Hazeltine came in. The face
      of the individual by the table turned white and his fingers fell from the
      regulating screw, as though the latter were red hot. The Captain
      recognized the men; they were day operators whom he had met in the village
      many times. Incidentally, they were avowed friends of the former
      electrician, Parker. The name of the taller one was McLoughlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke. Ralph strode quickly to the table, pushed McLoughlin to one
      side and stooped over the instruments. When he straightened up, Captain
      Eri noticed that his face also was white, but evidently not from fear. He
      turned sharply and looked at the four operators, who were doing their best
      to appear at ease and not succeeding. The electrician looked them over,
      one by one. Then he gave a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned sneaks!&rdquo; he said, and turned again to the testing apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began slowly to turn the regulating screw on the recorder. He had given
      it but a few revolutions when the point of the little glass siphon, that
      had been tracing a straight black line on the sliding tape, moved up and
      down in curving zigzags. Hazeltine turned to the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Palmer,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;answer that call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man addressed seated himself at the table, turned a switch, and
      clicked off a message. After a moment the line on the moving tape
      zigzagged again. Ralph glanced at the zigzags and bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apologize to them,&rdquo; he said to Palmer. &ldquo;Tell them we regret exceedingly
      that the ship should have been kept waiting. Tell them our recorder was
      out of adjustment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The operator cabled the message. The three men at the end of the room
      glanced at each other; this evidently was not what they expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steps sounded on the stairs and Peters hurriedly entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Langley, the superintendent of the station, had been in the company&rsquo;s
      employ for years. He had been in charge of the Cape Cod station since it
      was built, and he liked the job. He knew cable work, too, from A to Z,
      and, though he was a strict disciplinarian, would forgive a man&rsquo;s getting
      drunk occasionally, sooner than condone carelessness. He was eccentric,
      but even those who did not like him acknowledged that he was &ldquo;square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came into the room, tossed a cigar stump out of the window, and nodded
      to Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Captain Hedge?&rdquo; he said. Then, stepping to the table, he
      picked up the tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything all right, Mr. Hazeltine?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Hello! What does this
      mean? They say they have been calling for two hours without getting an
      answer. How do you explain that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very quiet in the room when the electrician answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The recorder here was out of adjustment, sir,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of adjustment! I thought you told me everything was in perfect order
      before you left this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, sir, but I find the screw was too loose. That would account
      for the call not reaching us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too loose! Humph!&rdquo; The superintendent looked steadfastly at Hazeltine,
      then at the operators, and then at the electrician once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;I will hear what explanations you may
      have to make in my office later on. I will attend to the testing myself.
      That will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri silently followed his young friend to the back door of the
      station. Hazeltine had seen fit to make no comment on the scene just
      described, and the captain did not feel like offering any. They were
      standing on the steps when the big operator, McLoughlin, came out of the
      building behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said gruffly to the electrician. &ldquo;Shall I quit now or wait
      until Saturday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I git out now or wait till Saturday night? I suppose you&rsquo;ll have me
      fired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Hazeltine&rsquo;s pent-up rage boiled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean that I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Langley of your cowardly trick and have
      you discharged&mdash;No! I don&rsquo;t pay my debts that way. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
      this,&mdash;you and your sneaking friends. If you try another game like
      that,&mdash;yes, or if you so much as speak to me, other than on business
      while I&rsquo;m here, I WILL fire you&mdash;out of the window. Clear out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; said Captain Eri a few moments later, &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t
      mind my sayin&rsquo; that I like you fust-rate. Me and Perez and Jerry ain&rsquo;t the
      biggest bugs in town, but we like to have our friends come and see us. I
      wish you&rsquo;d drop in once &lsquo;n a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will,&rdquo; said the young man, and the two shook hands. That
      vigorous handshake was enough of itself to convince Ralph Hazeltine that
      he had made, at any rate, one friend in Orham.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we may as well add here that he had made two. For that evening Jack
      McLoughlin said to his fellow conspirators:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d fire me out of the window,&mdash;ME, mind you! And, by
      thunder! I believe he&rsquo;d have DONE it too. Boys, there ain&rsquo;t any more &lsquo;con&rsquo; 
      games played on that kid while I&rsquo;m around&mdash;Parker or no Parker. He&rsquo;s
      white, that&rsquo;s what HE is!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE WOMAN FROM NANTUCKET
    </h3>
    <p>
      Conversation among the captains was, for the next two days, confined to
      two topics, speculation as to how soon they might expect a reply from the
      Nantucket female and whether or not Mr. Langley would discharge Hazeltine.
      On the latter point Captain Eri was decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be bounced,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;now you just put that down in
      your log. Langley ain&rsquo;t a fool, and he can put two and two together as
      well as the next feller. If I thought there was any need of it, I&rsquo;d just
      drop him a hint myself, but there ain&rsquo;t, so I shan&rsquo;t put my oar in. But I
      wish you two could have heard that youngster talk to that McLoughlin
      critter; &lsquo;twould have done you good. That boy&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry was alone when the expected letter came. He glanced at the
      postmark, saw that it was Nantucket, and stuck the note behind the clock.
      He did his best to forget it, but he looked so guilty when Captain Perez
      returned at supper time that that individual suspected something, made his
      friend confess, and, a little later when Captain Eri came in, the
      envelope, bearing many thumb-prints, was propped up against the sugar bowl
      in the middle of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t open it, Eri,&rdquo; said Perez proudly. &ldquo;We did want to, but we
      thought all hands ought to be on deck when anything as important as this
      was goin&rsquo; to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been holdin&rsquo; it up to the light for the last ha&rsquo;f hour,&rdquo; sneered
      Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Anybody &lsquo;d think it had a million dollars in it. For the
      land&rsquo;s sake, open it, Eri, &lsquo;fore he has a fit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri picked up the letter, looked it over very deliberately, and
      then tore off the end of the envelope. The inclosure was another sheet of
      note paper like the first epistle. The Captain took out his spectacles,
      wiped them, and read the following aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CAPTAIN JEREMIAH BURGESS.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir: I like your looks well enough, though it don&rsquo;t pay to put too much
      dependence in looks, as nobody knows better than me. Besides, I judge that
      picture was took quite a spell ago. Anyway, you look honest, and I am
      willing to risk money enough to carry me to Orham and back, though the
      dear land knows I ain&rsquo;t got none to throw away. If we don&rsquo;t agree to sign
      articles, I suppose likely you will be willing to stand half the fare.
      That ain&rsquo;t any more than right, the way I look at it. I shall come to
      Orham on the afternoon train, Thursday. Meet me at the depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARTHA B. SNOW.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I should have liked it better if you was a Methodist, but we
      can&rsquo;t have everything just as we want it in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nobody spoke for a moment after the reading of this intensely practical
      note. Captain Eri whistled softly, scratched his head, and then read the
      letter over again to himself. At length Captain Perez broke the spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerusalem!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t lose no time, does she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty prompt, that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; assented Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry burst forth in indignation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is THAT all you&rsquo;ve got to say?&rdquo; he inquired with sarcasm, &ldquo;after gittin&rsquo; 
      me into a scrape like this? Well now, I tell you one thing, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go on your beam ends, Jerry,&rdquo; interrupted Captain Eri. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
      no harm done yit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no harm done? Why how you talk, Eri Hedge! Here&rsquo;s a woman that I
      ain&rsquo;t never seen, and might be a hundred years old, for all I know, comin&rsquo; 
      down here to-morrow night to marry me by main force, as you might say, and
      you set here and talk about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, hold on, hold on, Jerry! She ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to marry you unless you
      want her to, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely. More I think of it, the more I like the
      woman&rsquo;s way of doin&rsquo; things. She&rsquo;s got sense, there&rsquo;s no doubt of that.
      You can&rsquo;t sell HER a cat in a bag. She&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; down here to see you and
      talk the thing over, and I glory in her spunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants me to pay her fare! I see myself doin&rsquo; it! I&rsquo;ve got ways enough to
      spend my money without paying fares for Nantucket folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you and she sign articles, as she calls it, you&rsquo;ll have to pay more
      than fares,&rdquo; said Captain Perez, in a matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;I think same
      as Eri does; she&rsquo;s a smart woman. We&rsquo;ll have to meet her at the depot, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t! Cheeky thing! Let her find out where I am! I
      cal&rsquo;late she&rsquo;ll have to do some huntin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, Jerry,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;you was jest as anxious to have
      one of us get married as anybody else. You haven&rsquo;t got to marry the woman
      unless you want to, but you have got to help us see the thing through. I
      wish myself that we hadn&rsquo;t been quite so pesky anxious to give her the
      latitude and longitude, and had took some sort of an observation
      ourselves; but we didn&rsquo;t, and now we&rsquo;ve got to treat her decent. You&rsquo;ll be
      at that depot along with Perez and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Eri spoke in that tone his two cronies usually obeyed orders.
      Even the rebellious Jerry, who had a profound respect for his younger
      friend, gave in after some grumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat up until late, speculating concerning the probable age and
      appearance of the expected visitor. Captain Perez announced that he didn&rsquo;t
      know why it was, but he had a notion that she was about forty and slim.
      Captain Jerry, who was in a frame of mind where agreement with anyone was
      out of the question, gave it as his opinion that she was thirty odd and
      rather plump. Captain Eri didn&rsquo;t hazard a guess, but suggested that they
      wait and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even Captain Eri&rsquo;s calmness was more or less assumed, for he did not
      go fishing the next morning, but stayed about the house, whittling at the
      model of a clipper ship and tormenting Captain Jerry. The model was one
      that he had been at work upon at odd times ever since he gave up
      sea-going. It had never been completed for the very good reason that when
      one part was finished the Captain tore another part to pieces, and began
      over again. It was a sort of barometer of his feelings, and when his
      companions saw him take down the clipper and go to work, they knew he was
      either thinking deeply upon a perplexing problem or was troubled in his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez sang a good deal, principally confining his musical efforts
      to a ballad with a chorus of,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     |          &ldquo;Storm along, John;
     |           John, storm along;
     |     Ain&rsquo;t I glad my day&rsquo;s work&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Also, he glanced at his watch every few minutes and then went to consult
      the chronometer to make sure of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry went up to the schoolhouse and gave its vacant rooms a
      thorough sweeping for no particular reason except to be doing something.
      His appetite was poor, and he actually forgot to feed Lorenzo, a hitherto
      unheard-of slight, and one that brought down upon him a long lecture from
      Captain Eri, who vowed that loss of memory was a sure sign of
      lovesickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started for the railway station immediately after supper. As they
      passed John Baxter&rsquo;s house they noticed a light in an upper chamber, and
      wondered if the old man was ill. Captain Eri would have stopped to find
      out, but Captain Perez insisted that it could be done just as well when
      they came back, and expressed a fear that they might miss the train.
      Captain Jerry hadn&rsquo;t spoken since they left home, and walked gloomily
      ahead with his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders, fat and in his pink-striped shirtsleeves, sat upon the
      steps of his saloon as they went by. He wished them an unctuous
      good-evening. The oily smoothness of Mr. Saunders&rsquo; voice cannot be
      described with plain pen and ink; it gurgled with sweetness, like molasses
      poured from a jug. This was not a special tone put on for the occasion; no
      one except his wife ever heard him speak otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The response from the three captains was not enthusiastic, but Mr.
      Saunders continued to talk of the weather, the fishing, and the cranberry
      crop until a customer came and gave them a chance to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slick! slick! slick!&rdquo; commented Captain Eri, as they hurried along.
      &ldquo;Blessed if he don&rsquo;t pretty nigh purr. I like a cat fust-rate, but I&rsquo;m
      always suspicious of a cat-man. You know he&rsquo;s got claws, but you can&rsquo;t
      tell where he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to use &lsquo;em. When a feller like that comes slidin&rsquo; 
      around and rubbin&rsquo; his head against my shin, I always feel like keepin&rsquo; 
      t&rsquo;other foot ready for a kick. You&rsquo;re pretty sartin to need it one time or
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The train was nearly an hour late this evening, owing to a hot box, and
      the &ldquo;ex-seafaring man&rdquo; and his two friends peered anxiously out at it from
      around the corner of the station. The one coach stopped directly under the
      lights, and they could see the passengers as they came down the steps. Two
      or three got out, but these were men. Then came an apparition that caused
      Captain Jerry to gasp and clutch at Perez for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the steps of the car came a tall, coal-black negress, and in her hand
      was a canvas extension case, on the side of which was blazoned in two-inch
      letters the fateful name, &ldquo;M. B. Snow, Nantucket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri gazed at this astounding spectacle for a full thirty seconds.
      Then he woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey domino!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;BLACK! BLACK! Run! Run for your lives,
      &lsquo;fore she sees us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This order was superfluous. Captain Jerry was already half-way to the
      fence, and going at a rate which bid fair to establish a record for his
      age. The others fell into his wake, and the procession moved across
      country like a steeplechase.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed over stone walls and splashed into meadows. They took every
      short cut between the station and their home. As they came in sight of the
      latter, Captain Perez&rsquo; breath gave out almost entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave to!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Heave to, or I&rsquo;ll founder. I wouldn&rsquo;t run another
      step for all the darkies in the West Indies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri paused, but it was only after a struggle that Captain Jerry
      was persuaded to halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do it, Eri!&rdquo; he vowed wildly. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do it! There ain&rsquo;t no
      use askin&rsquo; me; I won&rsquo;t marry that black woman! I won&rsquo;t, by thunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! Jerry!&rdquo; said Captain Eri soothingly. &ldquo;Nobody wants you to.
      There ain&rsquo;t no danger now. She didn&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no danger! There you go again, Eri Hedge! She&rsquo;ll ask where I live
      and come right down in the depot wagon. Oh! Lordy! Lordy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frantic sacrifice was about to bound away again, when Captain Eri
      caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll scoot for Eldredge&rsquo;s shanty and hide
      there till she gits tired and goes away. P&rsquo;raps she won&rsquo;t come, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deserted fish shanty, property of the heirs of the late Nathaniel
      Eldredge, was situated in a hollow close to the house. In a few moments
      the three were inside, with a sawhorse against the door. Then Captain Eri
      pantingly sat down on an overturned bucket and laughed until the tears
      came into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, laff!&rdquo; almost sobbed Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Set there and tee-hee
      like a Bedlamite. It&rsquo;s what you might expect. Wait till the rest of the
      town finds out about this; they&rsquo;ll do the laffin&rsquo; then, and you won&rsquo;t feel
      so funny. We&rsquo;ll never hear the last of it in this world. If that darky
      comes down here, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll drown her; I will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame Jerry,&rdquo; said Perez indignantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see much to laff
      at. Oh, my soul and body there she comes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard the rattle of a heavy carriage, and, crowding together at the
      cobwebbed window, saw the black shape of the &ldquo;depot wagon&rdquo; rock past. They
      waited, breathless, until they saw it go back again up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you lock the dining-room door, Perez?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I didn&rsquo;t. Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a rather senseless question. Nobody locks doors in Orham except at
      bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Eri. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see the light in the dining room,
      and go inside and wait, more &lsquo;n likely. Well, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; for us to do
      but to stay here for a while, and then, if she ain&rsquo;t gone, one of us &lsquo;ll
      have to go up and tell her she won&rsquo;t suit and pay her fare home, that&rsquo;s
      all. I think Jerry ought to be the one,&rdquo; he added mischievously. &ldquo;He bein&rsquo; 
      the bridegroom, as you might say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; almost shouted the frantic Captain Jerry. &ldquo;You go to grass! You
      fellers got me into this scrape, and now let&rsquo;s see you git me out of it. I
      don&rsquo;t stir one step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat there in darkness, the silence unbroken, save for an occasional
      chuckle from the provoking Eri. Perez, however, was meditating, and
      observed, after a while:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow! That&rsquo;s a queer name for a darky, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That colored man up at Barry&rsquo;s place was named White,&rdquo; said Captain
      Jerry, &ldquo;and he was black as your hat. Names don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say colored folks make good cooks, Jerry,&rdquo; slyly remarked Eri.
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unlucky victim of chance did not deign an answer, and the minutes
      crept slowly by. After a long while they heard someone whistling. Perez
      went to the window to take an observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; he said disappointedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been to our house, too. My
      land! I hope he didn&rsquo;t go in. It&rsquo;s that feller Hazeltine; that&rsquo;s who
      &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Eri eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! so &lsquo;tis. Let&rsquo;s give him a
      hail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could be stopped he had pulled the saw-horse from the door, had
      opened the latter a little way, and, with his face at the opening, was
      whistling shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician looked up and down the dark road in a puzzled sort of way,
      but evidently could not make up his mind from what quarter the whistles
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine!&rdquo; hailed the Captain, in what might be called a whispered
      yell or a shouted whisper. &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine! Here, on your lee bow. In the
      shanty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;shanty&rdquo; was the only part of the speech that brought light to
      Ralph&rsquo;s mind, but that was sufficient; he came down the hill, left the
      road, and plunged through the blackberry vines to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why, hello, Captain! What on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri signaled him to silence, and then, catching his arm, pulled
      him into the shanty and shut the door. Captain Jerry hastened to set the
      saw-horse in place again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;let me make you acquainted with Cap&rsquo;n
      Perez and Cap&rsquo;n Jerry, shipmates of mine. You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph, in the darkness, shook two big hands and heard whispered voices
      express themselves as glad to know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Eri in a somewhat embarrassed fashion, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re sort of
      layin&rsquo; to, as yer might say, waitin&rsquo; to git our bearin&rsquo;s. We ain&rsquo;t out of
      our heads; I tell you that, &lsquo;cause I know that&rsquo;s what it looks like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bewildered Hazeltine laughed and said he was glad to hear it. To tell
      the truth, he had begun to think that something or other had suddenly driven
      his nearest neighbors crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it to you,&rdquo; the Captain
      stumbled on. &ldquo;Fact is, I guess I won&rsquo;t jest yit, if you don&rsquo;t mind. It
      does sound so pesky ridic&rsquo;lous, although it ain&rsquo;t, when you understand it.
      What we want to know is, have you been to our house and is there anybody
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I&rsquo;ve been there. I rowed over and dropped in for a minute, as
      you suggested the other day. The housekeeper&mdash;I suppose it was the
      housekeeper&mdash;that opened the door, said you were out, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a hopeless groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; wailed Captain Jerry. &ldquo;I knew it! And you said there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      no danger, Eri!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush up, Jerry, a minute, for the love of goodness! What was she doin&rsquo;,
      Mr. Hazeltine, this woman you thought was the housekeeper? Did she look as
      if she was gettin&rsquo; ready to go out? Did she have her bunnit on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She seemed to be very much at home. That&rsquo;s why I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But again Captain Jerry broke in, &ldquo;Well, by mighty!&rdquo; he ejaculated.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, now, ain&rsquo;t it! SHE goin&rsquo; away! You bet she ain&rsquo;t! She&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to stay there and wait, if it&rsquo;s forever. She&rsquo;s got too good a thing.
      Jest as like &lsquo;s not, M&rsquo;lissy Busteed, or some other gab machine like her,
      &lsquo;ll be the next one to call, and if they see that great black critter! Oh!
      my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black!&rdquo; said Ralph amazedly. &ldquo;Why, the woman at your house isn&rsquo;t black.
      She&rsquo;s as white as I am, and not bad-looking for a woman of her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; This was the trio in chorus. Then Captain Eri said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine, now, honest and true, is that a fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain wiped his forehead. &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if anybody had
      told me a fortn&rsquo;t ago that I was one of the three biggest fools in Orham,
      I&rsquo;d have prob&rsquo;ly rared up some. As &lsquo;tis now, I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;d thank him for
      lettin&rsquo; me off so easy. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse us to-night, I&rsquo;m afraid.
      We&rsquo;re in a ridic&rsquo;lous scrape that we&rsquo;ve got to git out of all alone. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you &lsquo;bout it some day. Jest now wish you&rsquo;d keep this kind of quiet to
      oblige me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazeltine saw that this was meant as a gentle hint for his immediate
      departure, and although he had a fair share of curiosity, felt there was
      nothing else to do. He promised secrecy, promised faithfully to call again
      later in the week, and then, the sawhorse having been removed by Captain
      Perez,&mdash;Captain Jerry was apparently suffering from a sort of dazed
      paralysis,&mdash;he went away. As soon as he had gone, Captain Eri began
      to lay down the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been some sort of a mistake; that&rsquo;s plain
      enough. More &lsquo;n likely, the darky took the wrong satchel when she got up
      to come out of the car. That woman at the house is the real Marthy Snow
      all right, and we&rsquo;ve got to go right up there and see her. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Jerry mutinied outright. He declared that the sight of that
      darky had sickened him of marrying forever, and that he would not see the
      candidate from Nantucket, nor any other candidate. No persuasion could
      budge him. He simply would not stir from that shanty until the house had
      been cleared of female visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and see her yourself, if you&rsquo;re so set on it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
      shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Captain Eri calmly. &ldquo;I will. I&rsquo;ll tell her you&rsquo;re
      bashful, but jest dyin&rsquo; to be married, and that she can have you if she
      only waits long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he turned on his heel and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Eri!&rdquo; shouted the frantic Jerry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it! Don&rsquo;t you
      tell her that! Land of love, Perez, do you s&rsquo;pose he will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the answer in a disgusted tone. &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      have been so pig-headed, Jerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, with set teeth and determination written on his face, walked
      straight to the dining-room door. Drawing a long breath, he opened it and
      stepped inside. A woman, who had been sitting in Captain Perez&rsquo; rocker,
      rose as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked at the Captain and the Captain looked at her. She was of
      middle age, inclined to stoutness, with a pair of keen eyes behind
      brass-rimmed spectacles, and was dressed in a black &ldquo;alpaca&rdquo; gown that was
      faded a little in places and had been neatly mended in others. She spoke
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Cap&rsquo;n Burgess?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the Captain uneasily. &ldquo;My name is Hedge. I&rsquo;m a sort of
      messmate of his. You&rsquo;re Miss Snow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Snow. I&rsquo;m a widow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands. Mrs. Snow calmly expectant; the Captain very nervous and
      not knowing how to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if I knew you, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; said the widow, as the Captain
      slid into his own rocker. &ldquo;The boy on the depot wagon told me a lot about
      you and Cap&rsquo;n Ryder and Cap&rsquo;n Burgess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, hey?&rdquo; The Captain inwardly vowed vengeance on his chum&rsquo;s
      grandnephew. &ldquo;Hope he gave us a clean bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo; against you, if that&rsquo;s what you mean. If he
      had, I don&rsquo;t think it would have made much diff&rsquo;rence. I&rsquo;ve lived long
      enough to want to find out things for myself, and not take folks&rsquo; say-so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady seeming to expect some sort of answer to this statement, Captain
      Eri expressed his opinion that the plan of finding out things for one&rsquo;s
      self was a good &ldquo;idee.&rdquo; Then, after another fidgety silence, he observed
      that it was a fine evening. There being no dispute on this point, he
      endeavored to think of something else to say. Mrs. Snow, however, saved
      him the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;m here on what you might call a bus&rsquo;ness
      errand, and as I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; pretty nigh two hours already, p&rsquo;raps
      we&rsquo;d better talk about somethin&rsquo; besides fine evenin&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve got to be
      lookin&rsquo; up a hotel or boardin&rsquo; house or somewheres to stay to-night, and I
      can&rsquo;t wait much longer. I jedge you got my letter and was expectin&rsquo; me.
      Now, if it ain&rsquo;t askin&rsquo; too much, I&rsquo;d like to know where Cap&rsquo;n Burgess is,
      and why he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t at the depot to meet me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a leading question, and the Captain was more embarrassed than
      ever. However, he felt that something had to be done and that it was
      wisest to get it over with as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&mdash;we got your letter all right, and, to
      tell you the truth, we was at the depot&mdash;Perez and me and Jerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You WAS! Well, then, for the land of goodness, why didn&rsquo;t you let me know
      it? Such a time as I had tryin&rsquo; to find out where you lived and all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain saw but one plausible explanation, and that was the plain
      truth. Slowly he told the story of the colored woman and the extension
      case. The widow laughed until her spectacles fell off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If that don&rsquo;t beat all! I don&rsquo;t blame Cap&rsquo;n
      Burgess a mite. Poor thing! I guess I&rsquo;d have run, too, if I&rsquo;d have seen
      that darky. She was settin&rsquo; right in the next seat to me, and she had a
      shut-over bag consid&rsquo;rable like mine, and when she got up to git out, she
      took mine by mistake. I was a good deal put out about it, and I expect I
      talked to her like a Dutch uncle when I caught up with her. Dear! dear!
      Where is Cap&rsquo;n Burgess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shut up in a fish shanty down the road, and he&rsquo;s so upsot that I
      dunno&rsquo;s he&rsquo;ll stir from there tonight. Jerry ain&rsquo;t prejudiced, but that
      darky was too much for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they both laughed, the widow because of the ludicrous nature of
      the affair and the Captain because of the relief that the lady&rsquo;s
      acceptance of it afforded his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow was the first to become grave. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      one or two things I must say right here. In the first place, I ain&rsquo;t in
      the habit of answerin&rsquo; advertisements from folks that wants to git
      married; I ain&rsquo;t so hard up for a man as all that comes to. Next thing, I
      didn&rsquo;t come down here with my mind made up to marry Cap&rsquo;n Burgess, not by
      no means. I wanted to see him and talk with him, and tell him jest all
      about how things was with me and find out about him and then&mdash;why, if
      everything was shipshape, I might, p&rsquo;raps, think about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest so, ma&rsquo;am, jest so,&rdquo; broke in her companion. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the way
      we felt. You see, there&rsquo;s prob&rsquo;ly a long story on both sides, and if
      you&rsquo;ll excuse me I&rsquo;ll go down to the shanty and see if I can&rsquo;t git Jerry
      up here. It&rsquo;ll be a job, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you shan&rsquo;t either. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. It&rsquo;s awful late now
      and I must be gittin&rsquo; up to the tavern. S&rsquo;pose, if &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t too much
      trouble, you walk up there with me and I&rsquo;ll stay there to-night and
      to-morrer I&rsquo;ll come down here, and we&rsquo;ll all have a common-sense talk.
      P&rsquo;raps by that time your friend &lsquo;ll have the darky woman some off his
      mind, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say Captain Eri agreed to this plan with alacrity. The widow
      carefully tied on a black, old-fashioned bonnet, picked up a fat,
      wooden-handled umbrella and the extension case, and said that she was
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked up the road together, the Captain carrying the extension case.
      They talked, but not of matrimonial prospects. Mrs. Snow knew almost as
      much about the sea and the goings and comings thereon as did her escort,
      and the conversation was salty in the extreme. It developed that the
      Nantucket lady had a distant relative who was in the life-saving service
      at Cuttyhunk station, and as the Captain knew every station man for twenty
      miles up and down the coast, wrecks and maritime disasters of all kinds
      were discussed in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Traveler&rsquo;s Rest Mrs. Snow was introduced by the unblushing Eri as a
      cousin from Provincetown, and, after some controversy concerning the price
      of board and lodging, she was shown up to her room. Captain Eri walked
      home, absorbed in meditation. Whatever his thoughts were they were not
      disagreeable, for he smiled and shook his head more than once, as if with
      satisfaction. As he passed John Baxter&rsquo;s house he noticed that the light
      in the upper window was still burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez was half asleep when Eri opened the door of the shanty.
      Captain Jerry, however, was very much awake and demanded to be told things
      right away. His friend briefly explained the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if she stays here till doomsday,&rdquo; emphatically declared the
      disgruntled one, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t marry her. What&rsquo;s she like, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised at the enthusiasm of Captain Eri&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a mighty good woman; that&rsquo;s what I think she is, and she&rsquo;d make a
      fust-class wife for any man. I hope you&rsquo;ll say so, too, when you see her.
      There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; hity-tity about her, but she&rsquo;s got more common-sense
      than any woman I ever saw. But there! I shan&rsquo;t talk another bit about her
      to-night. Come on home and turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And go home and turn in they did, but not without protestation from the
      pair who had yet to meet the woman from Nantucket.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SCHOOLHOUSE BELL RINGS
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All hands on deck! Turn out there! Turnout!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri grunted and rolled over in his bed; for a moment or two he
      fancied himself back in the fo&rsquo;castle of the Sea Mist, the bark in which
      he had made his first voyage. Then, as he grew wider awake, he heard,
      somewhere in the distance, a bell ringing furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out, all hands! Turn out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri sat up. That voice was no part of a dream. It belonged to
      Captain Jerry, and the tone of it meant business. The bell continued to
      ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, Jerry! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire! There&rsquo;s a big fire up in the village. Look out of the window, and
      you can see. They&rsquo;re ringing the schoolhouse bell; don&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, wide awake enough by this time, jumped out of bed, carrying
      the blankets with him, and ran to the window. Opening it, he thrust out
      his head. The wind had changed to the eastward, and a thick fog had come
      in with it. The house was surrounded by a wet, black wall, but off to the
      west a red glow shone through it, now brighter and now fainter. The
      schoolhouse bell was turning somersaults in its excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once, since Captain Jerry had been janitor, had the schoolhouse bell
      been rung except in the performance of its regular duties. That once was
      on a night before the Fourth of July, when some mischievous youngsters
      climbed in at a window and proclaimed to sleeping Orham that Young America
      was celebrating the anniversary of its birth. Since then, on nights before
      the Fourth, Captain Jerry had slept in the schoolhouse, armed with a
      horsewhip and an ancient navy revolver. The revolver was strictly for
      show, and the horsewhip for use, but neither was called into service, for
      even if some dare-devil spirits did venture near the building, the
      Captain&rsquo;s snores, as he slumbered by the front door, were danger signals
      that could not be disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no flavor of the Fourth in the bell&rsquo;s note this night.
      Whoever the ringer might be, he was ringing as though it was his only hope
      for life, and the bell swung back and forth without a pause. The red glow
      in the fog brightened again as the Captain gazed at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry came tumbling up the stairs, breathless and half dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you make it out to be?&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere&rsquo;s nigh the post-office. Looks &lsquo;s if it might be Weeks&rsquo;s store.
      Where&rsquo;s Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri had lighted a lamp and was pulling on his boots, as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I be!&rdquo; shouted the missing member of the trio from the dining room
      below. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready. Hurry up, Eri!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri jumped into his trousers, slipped into a faded pea-jacket and
      clattered downstairs, followed by the wildly excited Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land, Perez!&rdquo; he cried, as he came into the dining room, &ldquo;I thought
      you said you was all ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez paused in the vain attempt to make Captain Jerry&rsquo;s hat cover
      his own cranium and replied indignantly, &ldquo;Well, I am, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;d put somethin&rsquo; on my feet besides them socks, if I was
      you. You might catch cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez glanced down at his blue-yarn extremities in blank astonishment.
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if I hain&rsquo;t forgot my boots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, git &lsquo;em on, and be quick. There&rsquo;s your hat. Give Jerry his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The excited Perez vanished through the door of his chamber, and Captain
      Eri glanced at the chronometer; the time was a quarter after two.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried out of the door and through the yard. The wind, as has been
      said, was from the east, but there was little of it and, except for the
      clanging of the bell, the night was very still. The fog was heavy and wet,
      and the trees and bushes dripped as if from a shower. There was the salt
      smell of the marshes in the air, and the hissing and splashing of the surf
      on the outer beach were plainly to be heard. Also there was the clicking
      sound of oars in row-locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody is comin&rsquo; over from the station,&rdquo; gasped Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      run so, Eri. It&rsquo;s too dark. I&rsquo;ve pretty nigh broke my neck already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed the lily pond, where the frogs had long since adjourned their
      concert and gone to bed, dodged through the yard of the tightly shuttered
      summer hotel, and came out at the corner of the road, having saved some
      distance by the &ldquo;short-cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t Weeks&rsquo;s store,&rdquo; declared Captain Perez, who was in the lead.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Web Saunders&rsquo;s place; that&rsquo;s what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri paused and looked over to the left in the direction of the
      Baxter homestead. The light in the window was still burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned into the &ldquo;main road&rdquo; at a dog trot and became part of a crowd
      of oddly dressed people, all running in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Web&rsquo;s place, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Eri of Seth Wingate, who was lumbering
      along with a wooden bucket in one hand and the pitcher of his wife&rsquo;s best
      washstand set in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathlessly answered Mr. Wingate, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a goner, they tell me.
      Every man&rsquo;s got to do his part if they&rsquo;re going to save it. I allers said
      we ought to have a fire department in this town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Considering that Seth had, for the past eight years, persistently opposed
      in town-meeting any attempt to purchase a hand engine, this was a rather
      surprising speech, but no one paid any attention to it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was in the billiard saloon sure enough, and the back portion of
      the building was in a blaze when they reached it. Ladders were placed
      against the eaves, and a line of men with buckets were pouring water on
      the roof. The line extended to the town pump, where two energetic youths
      in their shirtsleeves were working the handle with might and main. The
      houses near at hand were brilliantly illuminated, and men and women were
      bringing water from them in buckets, tin pails, washboilers, and even
      coalscuttles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the saloon another hustling crowd was busily working to &ldquo;save&rdquo; Mr.
      Saunders&rsquo; property. A dozen of the members had turned the biggest pool
      table over on its back and were unscrewing the legs, heedless of the fact
      that to attempt to get the table through the front door was an
      impossibility and that, as the back door was in the thickest of the fire,
      it, too, was out of the question. A man appeared at the open front window
      of the second story with his arms filled with bottles of various liquids,
      &ldquo;original packages&rdquo; and others. These, with feverish energy, he threw one
      by one into the street, endangering the lives of everyone in range and, of
      course, breaking every bottle thrown. Some one of the cooler heads calling
      his attention to these facts, he retired and carefully packed all the
      empty bottles, the only ones remaining, into a peach basket and tugged the
      latter downstairs and to a safe place on a neighboring piazza. Then he
      rested from his labors as one who had done all that might reasonably be
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders himself, lightly attired in a nightshirt tucked into a pair
      of trousers, was rushing here and there, now loudly demanding more water,
      and then stopping to swear at the bottle-thrower or some other enthusiast.
      &ldquo;Web&rsquo;s&rdquo; smoothness was all gone, and the language he used was, as Abigail
      Mullett said afterward, &ldquo;enough to bring down a jedgment on anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri caught him by the sleeve as he was running past and inquired,
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it start, Web?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it START? I know mighty well HOW it started, and &lsquo;fore I git
      through I&rsquo;ll know WHO started it. Somebody &lsquo;ll pay for this, now you hear
      me! Hurry up with the water, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tore frantically away to the pump and the three captains joined the
      crowd of volunteer firemen. Captain Eri, running round to the back of the
      building, took in the situation at once. Back of the main portion of the
      saloon was an ell, and it was in this ell that the fire had started. The
      ell, itself, was in a bright blaze, but the larger building in front was
      only just beginning to burn. The Captain climbed one of the ladders to the
      roof and called to the men at work there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shed&rsquo;s gone, Ben,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Chuck your water on the main part here.
      Maybe, if we had some ropes we might be able to pull the shed clear, and
      then we could save the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you fasten the ropes?&rdquo; was the panted reply. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all ablaze, and
      a rope would burn through in a minute if you tied it anywheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git some grapples and anchors out of Rogers&rsquo; shop. He&rsquo;s got a whole lot
      of &lsquo;em. Keep on with the water bus&rsquo;ness. I&rsquo;ll git the other stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He descended the ladder and explained his idea to the crowd below. There
      was a great shout and twenty men and boys started on a run after ropes,
      while as many more stormed at the door of Nathaniel Rogers&rsquo; blacksmith
      shop. Rogers was the local dealer in anchors and other marine ironwork.
      The door of the shop was locked and there was a yell for axes to burst it
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arose an agonized shriek of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t chop! don&rsquo;t chop!&rdquo; and Mr. Rogers
      himself came struggling to the defense of his property. In concert the
      instant need was explained to him, but he remained unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here arguin&rsquo; all night!&rdquo; roared one of the leaders. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      got to let us in. Go ahead and chop! I&rsquo;ll hold him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you fair warnin&rsquo;, Squealer Wixon! If you chop that door, I&rsquo;ll have
      the law onto you. I just had that door painted, and&mdash;STOP! I&rsquo;ve got
      the key in my pocket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that the majority were still in favor of chopping, as
      affording a better outlet for surplus energy, but they waited while Mr.
      Rogers, still protesting, produced the key and unlocked the door. In
      another minute the greater portion of the ironwork in the establishment
      was on its way to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope-seekers were just returning, laden with everything from
      clothes-lines to cables. Half a dozen boat anchors and a grapnel were
      fastened to as many ropes, and the crowd pranced gayly about the burning
      ell, looking for a chance to make them fast. Captain Eri found a party
      with axes endeavoring to cut a hole through the side of the saloon in
      order to get out the pool table. After some endeavor he persuaded them to
      desist and they came around to the rear and, taking turns, ran in close to
      the shed and chopped at it until the fire drove them away. At last they
      made a hole close to where it joined the main building, large enough to
      attach the grapnel. Then, with a &ldquo;Yo heave ho!&rdquo; everyone took hold of the
      rope and pulled. Of course the grapnel pulled out with only a board or
      two, but they tried again, and, this time getting it around a beam, pulled
      a large portion of the shed to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, another ax party had attached an anchor to the opposite side,
      and were making good progress. In due time the shed yawned away from the
      saloon, tottered, and collapsed in a shower of sparks. A deluge of water
      soon extinguished these. Then everyone turned to the main building, and,
      as the fire had not yet taken a firm hold of this, they soon had it under
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri worked with the rest until he saw that the worst was over.
      Then he began the search that had been in his mind since he first saw the
      blaze. He found Captain Jerry and Captain Perez perspiringly passing
      buckets of water from hand to hand in the line, and, calling them to one
      side, asked anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have either of you fellers seen John Baxter tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez looked surprised, and then some of the trouble discernible
      in Eri&rsquo;s face was apparent in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen him, now you speak of it.
      Everybody in town&rsquo;s here, too. Queer, ain&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen him, either, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry answered with a shake of the head. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;Perez and me have been right here by the pump ever sence we come. He
      might be &lsquo;most anywheres else, and we wouldn&rsquo;t see him. Want me to ask
      some of the other fellers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed his friend, almost fiercely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mention his name
      to a soul, nor let &lsquo;em know you&rsquo;ve thought of him. If anybody should ask,
      tell &lsquo;em you guess he&rsquo;s right around somewheres. You two git to work
      ag&rsquo;in. I&rsquo;ll let you know if I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair took up their buckets, and the Captain walked on from group to
      group, looking carefully at each person. The Reverend Perley and some of
      his flock were standing by themselves on a neighboring stoop, and to them
      the searcher turned eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cap&rsquo;n Eri!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Busteed, the first to identify him, &ldquo;how
      you&rsquo;ve worked! You must be tired pretty nigh to death. Ain&rsquo;t it awful! But
      it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s; I&rsquo;m jest as sure of that as I can be, and I says
      so to Mr. Perley. Didn&rsquo;t I, Mr. Perley? I says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lookin&rsquo; for anybody, Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo; interrupted the reverend gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; lied the Captain calmly, &ldquo;jest walkin&rsquo; around to git cooled off a
      little. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the most likely place, and John Baxter was not there. Certainly
      every citizen in Orham, who was able to crawl, would be out this night,
      and if the old puritan hermit of the big house was not present to exult
      over the downfall of the wicked, it would be because he was ill or because&mdash;The
      Captain didn&rsquo;t like to think of the other reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders, quietly weeping, was seated on a knoll near the pump.
      Three of the Saunders&rsquo; hopefuls, also weeping, but not quietly, were
      seated beside her. Another, the youngest of the family, was being rocked
      soothingly in the arms of a stout female, who was singing to it as
      placidly as though fires were an every day, or night, occurrence. The
      Captain peered down, and the stout woman looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Snow!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady from Nantucket made no immediate reply. She rose, however, shook
      down the black &ldquo;alpaca&rdquo; skirt, which had been folded up to keep it out of
      the dew, and, still humming softly to the child, walked off a little way,
      motioning with her head for the Captain to follow. When she had reached a
      spot sufficiently remote from Mrs. Saunders, she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge? I guess the wust is over now, isn&rsquo;t it? I saw
      you workin&rsquo; with them ropes; you must be awful tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here?&rdquo; asked the Captain somewhat astonished at
      her calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I come right down as soon as I heard the bell. I&rsquo;m kind of used to
      fires. My husband&rsquo;s schooner got afire twice while I was with him. He used
      to run a coal vessel, you know. I got right up and packed my bag, &lsquo;cause I
      didn&rsquo;t know how the fire might spread. You never can tell in a town like
      this. Ssh&rsquo;h, dearie,&rdquo; to the baby, &ldquo;there, there, it&rsquo;s all right. Lay
      still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you git acquainted with her?&rdquo; nodding toward the wife of the
      proprietor of the scorched saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see the poor thing settin&rsquo; there with all them children and nobody
      paying much attention to her, so I went over and asked if I couldn&rsquo;t help
      out. I haven&rsquo;t got any children of my own, but I was number three in a
      fam&rsquo;ly of fourteen, so I know how it&rsquo;s done. Oh! that husband of hers!
      He&rsquo;s a nice one, he is! Would you b&rsquo;lieve it, he come along and she spoke
      to him, and he swore at her somethin&rsquo; dreadful. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s cryin&rsquo;.
      Poor critter, I guess by the looks she&rsquo;s used to it. Well, I give HIM a
      piece of my mind. He went away with a flea in his ear. I do despise a
      profane man above all things. Yes, the baby&rsquo;s all right, Mrs. Saunders.
      I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;. Good-night, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge. I s&rsquo;pose I shall see you all in the
      mornin&rsquo;. You ought to be careful and not stand still much this damp night.
      It&rsquo;s bad when you&rsquo;re het up so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went back, still singing to the baby, to where Mrs. Saunders sat, and
      the Captain looked after her in a kind of amazed fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mighty!&rdquo; he muttered, and then repeated it. Then he resumed his
      search.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that there had been a number of people on the side of the
      burning shed opposite that on which he had been employed, and he
      determined to have one look there before going to the Baxter homestead.
      Almost the first man he saw as he approached the dying fire was Ralph
      Hazeltine. The electrician&rsquo;s hands and face were blackened by soot, and
      the perspiration sparkled on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Captain!&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand. &ldquo;Lively for a while,
      wasn&rsquo;t it? They tell me you were the man who suggested pulling down the
      shed. It saved the day, all right enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d been workin&rsquo; some yourself. Was you one of the
      fellers that got that anchor in on this side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was THE one,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Wingate, who was standing at Hazeltine&rsquo;s
      elbow. &ldquo;He waded in with an ax and stayed there till I thought he&rsquo;d burn
      the hair off his head. Web ought to pay you and him salvage, Eri. The
      whole craft would have gone up if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if they got that pool table out,&rdquo; laughed Ralph. &ldquo;They did
      everything but saw it into chunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw Bluey Bacheldor work so afore,&rdquo; commented the Captain. &ldquo;I
      wish somebody&rsquo;d took a photograph of him. I&rsquo;ll bet you could sell &lsquo;em
      round town for curiosities. Well, I can&rsquo;t be standin&rsquo; here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going home I&rsquo;ll go along with you. I may as well be getting
      down toward the station. The excitement is about over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; right home, Mr. Hazeltine. I&rsquo;ve got an errand to do.
      Prob&rsquo;ly I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; pretty soon, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right! I&rsquo;ll wait here a while longer then. See you later
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fog had lifted somewhat and as the Captain, running silently, turned
      into the &ldquo;shore road,&rdquo; he saw that the light in the Baxter homestead had
      not been extinguished. The schoolhouse bell had ceased to ring, and the
      shouts of the crowd at the fire sounded faintly. There were no other
      sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the driveway Captain Eri hurried. There were no lights in the lower
      part of the house and the dining-room door was locked. The kitchen door,
      however, was not fastened and the Captain opened it and entered. Shutting
      it carefully behind him, he groped along to the entrance of the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John!&rdquo; he called softly. There was no answer, and the house was perfectly
      still save for the ticking of the big clock. Captain Eri scratched a match
      and by its light climbed the stairs. His friend&rsquo;s room was empty. The lamp
      was burning on the bureau and a Bible was open beside it. The bed had not
      been slept in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly alarmed now, the Captain, lamp in hand, went through one room
      after the other. John Baxter was not at home, and he was not with the
      crowd at the fire. Where was he? There was, of course, a chance that his
      friend had passed him on the way or that he had been at the fire, after
      all, but this did not seem possible. However, there was nothing to do but
      go back, and this time the Captain took the path across the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baxter house was on the &ldquo;shore road,&rdquo; and the billiard room and
      post-office were on the &ldquo;main road.&rdquo; People in a hurry sometimes avoided
      the corner by climbing the fence opposite the Baxter gate, going through
      the Dawes&rsquo; pasture and over the little hill back of the livery stable, and
      coming out in the rear of the post-office and close to the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, worried, afraid to think of the fire and its cause, and only
      anxious to ascertain where his friend was and what he had been doing that
      night, trotted through the pasture and over the hill. Just as he came to
      the bayberry bushes on the other side he stumbled and fell flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew what it was that he had stumbled over the moment that he fell
      across it, and his fingers trembled, so that he could scarcely scratch the
      match that he took from his pocket. But it was lighted at last and, as its
      tiny blaze grew brighter, the Captain saw John Baxter lying face downward
      in the path, his head pointed toward his home and his feet toward the
      billiard saloon.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CAPTAIN ERI FINDS A NURSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a second, only, Captain Eri stood there motionless, stooping over the
      body of his friend. Then he sprang into vigorous action. He dropped upon
      his knees and, seizing the shoulder of the prostrate figure, shook it
      gently, whispering, &ldquo;John! John!&rdquo; There was no answer and no responsive
      movement, and the Captain bent his head and listened. Breath was there and
      life; but, oh, so little of either! The next thought was, of course, to
      run for help and for a doctor, but he took but a few steps when a new idea
      struck him and he came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lighting another match he examined the fallen man hurriedly. The old
      &ldquo;Come-Outer&rdquo; lay in the path with his arms outstretched, as if he had
      fallen while running. He was bare-headed, and there was no sign of a wound
      upon him. One coat-sleeve was badly scorched, and from a pocket in the
      coat protruded the neck of a bottle. The bottle was empty, but its odor
      was strong; it had contained kerosene. The evidence was clear, and the
      Captain knew that what he had feared was the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood erect and pondered as to what was best to do.
      Whatever it was, it must be done quickly, but if the doctor and those that
      might come with him should find the burned coat and the tell-tale bottle,
      it were better for John Baxter that consciousness and life never were his
      again. There might, and probably would, be suspicion; but here was proof
      absolute that meant prison and disgrace for a man whom all the community
      had honored and respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri weighed the chances, speculated on the result, and then did
      what seemed to him right. He threw the bottle as far away from the path as
      he could and then stripped off the coat, and, folding it into a small
      bundle, hid it in the bushes near by. Then he lifted the limp body, and
      turned it so that the gray head was toward the billiard saloon instead of
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perez and Jerry were still busy with the water buckets when their friend
      came panting up the knoll to the pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Eri!&rdquo; said the former, wiping his forehead with his arm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;bout out, ain&rsquo;t it? Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;; nothin&rsquo; to speak of. Put down them buckets, and you and Jerry
      come with me. I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; that I want you to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding and exchanging congratulations with acquaintances in the crowd on
      the success of the fire-fighting, Captain Eri led his messmates to a dark
      corner under a clump of trees. Then he took each of them by the arm and
      whispered sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Palmer&rsquo;s somewheres in this crowd. I want each of you fellers to go
      diff&rsquo;rent ways and look for him. Whichever one finds him fust can bring
      him up to the corner by the post-office. Whistle when you git there and
      the rest of us &lsquo;ll come. Don&rsquo;t stop to ask questions. I ain&rsquo;t hurt, but
      John Baxter&rsquo;s had a stroke or somethin&rsquo;. I can&rsquo;t tell you no more now.
      Hurry! And say, don&rsquo;t you mention to a soul what the matter is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sea-faring life has its advantages. It teaches prompt obedience, for one
      thing. The two mariners did not hesitate an instant, but bolted in
      opposite directions. Captain Eri watched them go, and then set off in
      another. He was stopped every few moments and all sorts of questions and
      comments concerning the fire and its cause were fired at him, but he put
      off some inquiries with a curt &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and others with nods or
      negatives, and threaded his way from one clump of townspeople to another.
      As he came close to the blackened and smoking billiard saloon, Ralph
      Hazeltine caught him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said the electrician. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you gone home yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yit. Say, I&rsquo;ll ask you, &lsquo;cause I cal&rsquo;late you can keep your mouth
      shut if it&rsquo;s necessary: Have you seen the Doctor anywheres &lsquo;round lately?
      He was here, &lsquo;cause I saw him when I fust come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, Dr. Palmer? No; I haven&rsquo;t seen him. Is anyone hurt? Can I help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not. John Baxter&rsquo;s sick, but&mdash;oh, Lord! Here comes Wingate.
      He&rsquo;ll talk for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seth, panting and excited, was pushing his way toward them, shouting the
      Captain&rsquo;s name at the top of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Eri!&rdquo; he hailed. &ldquo;I want to know if you&rsquo;ll sign a petition to git
      the town a fire ingyne? I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; to a couple of the s&rsquo;lectmen and
      they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Wingate,&rdquo; interrupted Ralph, &ldquo;Mr. Mullett&rsquo;s been looking for you.
      He&rsquo;s over there by the pump, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, Lem Mullett? Is that so! He&rsquo;s jest the feller I want to see. See you
      later, Eri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grinned appreciatively as the convert to the hand-engine
      proposal disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t so bad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged. Hey! There&rsquo;s the
      whistle. Come on, Mr. Hazeltine, if you ain&rsquo;t in a special hurry. Maybe we
      WILL need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the corner by the post-office to find Dr. Palmer, who had
      practiced medicine in Orham since he received his diploma, waiting for
      them. Captain Perez, who had discovered the physician on the Nickerson
      piazza, was standing close by with his fingers in his mouth, whistling
      with the regularity of a foghorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut it short, Perez!&rdquo; commanded Eri. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Jerry ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And the whistling began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up, for the land&rsquo;s sake! D&rsquo;you want to fetch the whole tribe here?
      There&rsquo;s Jerry, now. Come on, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Baxter was lying just as the Captain had left him, and the others
      watched anxiously as the doctor listened at the parted lips, and thrust
      his hand inside the faded blue waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;but unconscious. We must get him
      home at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He heard the bell and was runnin&rsquo; to the fire when he was took,&rdquo; said
      Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Run out in his shirt sleeves, and was took when he got as
      fur as here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I figger it,&rdquo; said Eri unblushingly. &ldquo;Lift him carefully,
      you fellers. Now then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I warned him against over-exertion or excitement months ago,&rdquo; said the
      Doctor, as they bore the senseless burden toward the big house, now as
      black as the grave that was so near its owner. &ldquo;We must find someone to
      take care of him at once. I don&rsquo;t believe the old man has a relation
      within a hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we take him to our house?&rdquo; suggested Captain Jerry. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t
      seem so plaguey lonesome, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mighty!&rdquo; ejaculated Captain Eri in astonishment. &ldquo;Well, Jerry, I&rsquo;ll be
      switched if you ain&rsquo;t right down brilliant once in a while. Of course we
      will. He can have the spare room. Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so John Baxter, who had not paid a visit in his native village since
      his wife died, came at last to his friend&rsquo;s home to pay what seemed likely
      to be a final one. They carried him up the stairs to the spare room, as
      dismal and cheerless as spare rooms in the country generally are,
      undressed him as tenderly as their rough hands would allow, robed him in
      one of Captain Jerry&rsquo;s nightshirts&mdash;the buttons that fastened it had
      been sewed on by the Captain himself, and were all sizes and colors&mdash;and
      laid him in the big corded bedstead. The Doctor hastened away to procure
      his medicine case. Ralph Hazeltine, having been profusely thanked for his
      services and promising to call the next day, went back to the station, and
      the three captains sat down by the bedside to watch and wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri was too much perturbed to talk, but the other two, although
      sympathetically sorry for the sufferer, were bursting with excitement and
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if THIS ain&rsquo;t been a night!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Seem&rsquo;s if
      everything happened at once. Fust that darky and then the fire and then
      this. Don&rsquo;t it beat all?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; said Captain Perez anxiously, &ldquo;was John layin&rsquo; jest the same way
      when you found him as he was when we come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right in the same place,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say in the same place. I asked if he was layin&rsquo; the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t moved a muscle. Laid jest as if he was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be noticed that Captain Eri was adhering strictly to the truth.
      Luckily, Perez seemed to be satisfied, for he asked no further questions,
      but observed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we&rsquo;ve got a crowd to swear how we found
      him. There&rsquo;s a heap of folks in this town would be sayin&rsquo; he set that fire
      if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of &lsquo;em will be sayin&rsquo; it anyhow,&rdquo; remarked Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks &lsquo;ll say anything but their prayers,&rdquo; snapped Eri savagely.
      &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t say it while I&rsquo;m around. And look here! if you hear anybody
      sayin&rsquo; it, you tell &lsquo;em it&rsquo;s a lie. If that don&rsquo;t keep &lsquo;em quiet, let me
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right. WE know he didn&rsquo;t set it. I was jest sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, you&rsquo;re techy! Guess fires and colored folks don&rsquo;t agree with you.
      What are we goin&rsquo; to do now? If John don&rsquo;t die, and the Lord knows I hope
      he won&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s likely to be sick here a long spell. Who are we goin&rsquo; to
      git to take care of him? That&rsquo;s what I want to know. Somebody&rsquo;s got to do
      it and we ain&rsquo;t fit. If Jerry &lsquo;d only give in and git married now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Jerry&rsquo;s protest against matrimony was as obstinate as ever.
      Even Perez gave up urging after a while and conversation lagged again. In
      a few minutes the Doctor came back, and his examination of the patient and
      demands for glasses of water, teaspoons, and the like, kept Perez and
      Jerry busy. It was some time before they noticed that Captain Eri had
      disappeared. Even then they did not pay much attention to the
      circumstance, but watched the physician at work and questioned him
      concerning the nature of their guest&rsquo;s illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&rsquo;you think he&rsquo;ll die, Doctor?&rdquo; inquired Jerry in a hushed voice, as they
      came out of the sick room into the connecting chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say. He has had a stroke of paralysis, and there seem to be other
      complications. If he regains consciousness I shall think he has a chance,
      but not a very good one. His pulse is a little stronger. I don&rsquo;t think
      he&rsquo;ll die to-night, but if he lives he will need a good nurse, and I don&rsquo;t
      know of one in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me neither,&rdquo; said Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, A&rsquo;nt Zuby might come,&rdquo; suggested Jerry, &ldquo;but I should hate to have
      her nuss me, and as for bein&rsquo; WELL in a house where she was&mdash;whew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo;nt Zuby!&rdquo; sneered his messmate. &ldquo;If Lorenzo had a fit and they called
      A&rsquo;nt Zuby he&rsquo;d have another one and die. A&rsquo;nt Zuby! I&rsquo;d &lsquo;bout as soon have
      M&rsquo;lissy and be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t doubt YOU WOULD,&rdquo; was the anything but gentle retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Perez would have said to this thrust must be surmised, for just then
      the dining-room door opened and closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Eri,&rdquo; said Captain Jerry. Then he added in an alarmed whisper,
      &ldquo;Who on airth has he got with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard their friend&rsquo;s voice warning someone to be careful of the top
      step, and then the chamber door opened and Captain Eri appeared. There
      were beads of perspiration on his forehead, and he was carrying a shabby
      canvas extension-case. Captain Jerry gazed at the extension-case with
      bulging eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri put down the extension-case and opened the door wide. A woman
      came in; a stout woman dressed in black &ldquo;alpaca&rdquo; and wearing brass-rimmed
      spectacles. Captain Jerry gasped audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Palmer,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;let me make you acquainted with Mrs. Snow
      of Nantucket. Mrs. Snow, this is Dr. Palmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor and the lady from Nantucket shook hands, the former with a
      puzzled expression on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; continued the Captain, &ldquo;let me make you known to Mrs. Snow&mdash;Mrs.
      Marthy B. Snow,&rdquo;&mdash;this with especial emphasis,&mdash;&ldquo;of Nantucket.
      Mrs. Snow, this is Cap&rsquo;n Perez Ryder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands; Captain Perez managed to say that he was glad to meet
      Mrs. Snow. Captain Jerry said nothing, but he looked like a criminal
      awaiting the fall of the drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; continued the Captain, paying no attention to the signals of
      distress displayed by his friend, &ldquo;I heard you say a spell ago that John
      here needed somebody to take care of him. Well, Mrs. Snow&mdash;she&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;sort
      of relation of Jerry&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;just a suspicion of a smile accompanied this
      assertion&mdash;&ldquo;and she&rsquo;s done consid&rsquo;rable nussin&rsquo; in her time. I&rsquo;ve
      been talkin&rsquo; the thing over with her and she&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to look out for
      John till he gits better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician adjusted his eyeglasses and looked the volunteer nurse over
      keenly. The lady paid no attention to the scrutiny, but calmly removed her
      bonnet and placed it on the bureau. The room was Captain Eri&rsquo;s, and the
      general disarrangement of everything movable was only a little less marked
      than in those of his companions. Mrs. Snow glanced over the heap of odds
      and ends on the bureau and picked up a comb. There were some teeth in it,
      but they were distant neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use that comb very much,&rdquo; said Captain Eri rather apologetically.
      &ldquo;I gin&rsquo;rally use the one downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new-found relative of Captain Jerry said nothing, but, laying down the
      ruin, marched over to the extension-case, opened it, and took out another
      comb&mdash;a whole one. With this she arranged the hair on her forehead.
      It, the hair, was parted in the middle and drawn back smoothly at the
      sides, and Captain Eri noticed that it was brown with a little gray in it.
      When the last stray wisp was in place, she turned calmly to the Doctor and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Baxter&rsquo;s in here, I s&rsquo;pose. Shall I walk right in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man of medicine seemed a little surprised at the lady&rsquo;s command of the
      situation, but he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, ma&rsquo;am; I guess you may. You have nursed before, I think the
      Captain said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years with my husband. He had slow consumption. Before that with my
      mother, and most of my brothers and sisters at one time or another. I&rsquo;ve
      seen consid&rsquo;rable sickness all my life. More of that than anything else, I
      guess. Now, if you&rsquo;ll come in with me, so&rsquo;s to tell me about the medicine
      and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a short &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; the physician followed her into the sick room, while
      the three mariners gazed wide-eyed in at the door. They watched, as Doctor
      Palmer explained medicines and gave directions. It did not need an expert
      to see that the new nurse understood her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Doctor came out his face shone with gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;If all your relatives are like that,
      Cap&rsquo;n Burgess, I&rsquo;d like to know &lsquo;em; &lsquo;twould help me in my business.&rdquo; Then
      he added in response to a question, &ldquo;He seems to be a little better just
      now. I think there will be no change for a while; if there should be, send
      for me. I&rsquo;ll call in the morning. Gracious! it&rsquo;s almost daylight now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw him to the door and then came back upstairs. Mrs. Snow was busy,
      arranging the pillows, setting the room in something like order, and
      caring for her patient&rsquo;s garments, that had been tossed helter-skelter on
      the floor in the hurry of undressing. She came to the door as they entered
      Captain Eri&rsquo;s chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Snow,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better sleep in my room here long&rsquo;s
      you stay. I&rsquo;ll bunk in with Perez downstairs. I&rsquo;ll git my dunnage out of
      here right off. I think likely you&rsquo;ll want to clean up some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady from Nantucket glanced at the bureau top and seemed about to say
      something, but checked herself. What she did say was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d better introduce me to Cap&rsquo;n Burgess. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve
      ever met, if we ARE relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri actually blushed a little. &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Excuse
      me, ma&rsquo;am. Jerry, this is Mrs. Snow. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s got into me,
      bein&rsquo; so careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifice shook the nurse&rsquo;s hand and said something, nobody knew
      exactly what. Mrs. Snow went on to say, &ldquo;Now, I want you men to go right
      on to bed, for I know you&rsquo;re all tuckered out. We can talk to-morrow&mdash;I
      mean to-day, of course: I forgot &lsquo;twas next-door to daylight now. I shall
      set up with Cap&rsquo;n Baxter, and if I need you I&rsquo;ll call you. I&rsquo;ll call you
      anyway when I think it&rsquo;s time. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They protested, of course, but the lady would not listen. She calmly
      seated herself in the rocker by the bed and waved to them to go, which two
      of them reluctantly did after a while. The other one had gone already. It
      would be superfluous to mention his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs again and in Perez&rsquo; room Captain Eri came in for a questioning
      that bade fair to keep up forever. He shut off all inquiries, however,
      with the announcement that he wouldn&rsquo;t tell them a word about it till he&rsquo;d
      had some sleep. Then he would explain the whole thing, and they could
      decide whether he had done right or not. There were all sorts of things to
      be considered, he said, and they had better take a nap now while they
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d jest like to ask you this, Eri Hedge,&rdquo; demanded Captain Jerry.
      &ldquo;What in time did you tell the Doctor that she was a relation of mine for?
      That was a nice thing to do, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ll have to answer more fool
      questions &lsquo;bout that than a little. What sort of a relation shall I tell
      folks she is? Jest tell me that, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tell &lsquo;em she&rsquo;s a relation by marriage,&rdquo; was the answer, muffled by
      the bed clothes. &ldquo;Maybe that &lsquo;ll be true by the time they ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll BET it won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snorted the rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez fell asleep almost immediately. Captain Jerry, tired out,
      did the same, but Captain Eri&rsquo;s eyes did not close. The surf pounded and
      grumbled. A rooster, early astir, crowed somewhere in the distance. Daniel
      thumped the side of his stall and then subsided for another nap. The gray
      morning light brightened the window of the little house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Captain Eri slid silently out of bed, dressed with elaborate
      precautions against noise, put on his cap, and tiptoed out of the house.
      He walked through the dripping grass, climbed the back fence and hurried
      to the hill where John Baxter had fallen. Once there, he looked carefully
      around to be sure that no one was watching. Orham, as a rule, is an early
      riser, but this morning most of the inhabitants, having been up for the
      greater part of the night, were making up lost sleep and the Captain was
      absolutely alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assured of this, he turned to the bush underneath which he had hidden the
      burned coat, pushed aside the drenched boughs with their fading leaves and
      reached down for the tell-tale garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he made an unpleasant discovery. The coat was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent an agitated quarter of an hour hunting through every clump of
      bushes in the immediate vicinity, but there was no doubt of it. Someone
      had been there before him and had taken the coat away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOUSEKEEPER AND BOOK AGENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was a knock on the door of Captain Perez&rsquo;s sleeping apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow, &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge! I&rsquo;m sorry to wake you up, but
      it&rsquo;s &lsquo;most ten o&rsquo;clock and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Ten o&rsquo;clock! Godfrey scissors! Of all the lazy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be out in
      a jiffy. Perez, turn out there! Turn out, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri had fallen asleep in the rocker where he had seated himself
      upon his return from the fruitless search for the coat. He had had no
      intention of sleeping, but he was tired after his strenuous work at the
      fire, and had dropped off in the midst of his worry. He sprang to his
      feet, and tried to separate dreams from realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land of love, Perez!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Here you and me have been sleepin&rsquo; 
      ha&rsquo;f the forenoon. We&rsquo;d ought to be ashamed of ourselves. Let&rsquo;s git
      dressed quicker &lsquo;n chain lightnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dressed?&rdquo; queried Perez, sitting up in bed. &ldquo;I should think you was
      dressed now, boots and all. What are you talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain glanced down at his clothes and seemed as much surprised as
      his friend. He managed to pull himself together, however, and stammered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dressed? Oh, I&rsquo;m dressed, of course. It&rsquo;s you I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to git some life
      into.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you call a feller, &lsquo;stead of gittin&rsquo; up and dressin&rsquo; all
      by yourself. I never see such a critter. Where&rsquo;s my socks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To avoid further perplexing questions Captain Eri went into the dining
      room. The table was set, really set, with a clean cloth and dishes that
      shone. The knives and forks were arranged by the plates, not piled in a
      heap for each man to help himself. The Captain gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan to man!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Has Jerry had a fit or what&rsquo;s struck him?
      I ain&rsquo;t seen him do anything like this for I don&rsquo;t know when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cap&rsquo;n Burgess didn&rsquo;t fix the table, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; said
      the new nurse. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Baxter seemed to be sleepin&rsquo; or in a stupor like,
      and the Doctor, when he come, said I might leave him long enough to run
      downstairs for a few minutes, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Doctor? Has the Doctor been here this mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he come &lsquo;bout an hour ago. Now, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind goin&rsquo; up and
      stayin&rsquo; with Cap&rsquo;n Baxter for a few minutes while I finish gettin&rsquo; 
      breakfast. I&rsquo;ve been up and down so many times in the last ha&rsquo;f hour, I
      don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m sartin whether I&rsquo;m on my head or my heels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain went upstairs in a dazed state. As he passed through what had
      been his room he vaguely noticed that the bureau top was clean, and that
      most of the rubbish that had ornamented it had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man lay just as he had left him, his white face as colorless as
      the clean pillow case against which it rested. Captain Eri remembered that
      the pillow cases in the spare room had looked a little yellow the night
      before, possibly owing to the fact that, as the room had not been occupied
      for months, they had not been changed. He reasoned that the improvement
      was another one of the reforms instituted by the lady from Nantucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the rocker by the bed and thought, with a shiver, of the
      missing coat. There were nine chances out of ten that whoever found it
      would recognize it as belonging to the old &ldquo;Come-Outer.&rdquo; The contents of
      the pocket would be almost certain to reveal the secret if the coat itself
      did not. It remained to be seen who the finder was and what he would do.
      Meanwhile there was no use worrying. Having come to this conclusion the
      Captain, with customary philosophy, resolved to think of something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow entered and announced that breakfast was ready and that he must
      go down at once and eat it while it was hot. She, having breakfasted some
      time before, would stay with the patient until the meal was over. Captain
      Eri at first flatly declined to listen to any such arrangement, but the
      calm insistence of the Nantucket visitor prevailed as usual. The Captain
      realized that the capacity for &ldquo;bossin&rsquo; things,&rdquo; that he had discerned in
      the letter, was even more apparent in the lady herself. One thing he did
      insist upon, however, and this was that Mrs. Snow should &ldquo;turn in&rdquo; as soon
      as breakfast was over. One of the three would take the watch in the sick
      room while the other two washed the dishes. The nurse was inclined to balk
      on the dishwashing proposition, saying that she could do it herself after
      she had had a wink or two, but this the Captain wouldn&rsquo;t hear of. He went
      away, however, with an unsettled conviction that, although he and his
      partners might wash the dishes, Mrs. Snow would wash them again as soon as
      she had an opportunity. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say so, but she sort of looked it,&rdquo; he
      explained afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his friends seated at the table and feasting on hot biscuits,
      eggs, and clear, appetizing coffee. They greeted him joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Eri!&rdquo; hailed Captain Perez. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this gay? Look at them eggs;
      b&rsquo;iled jest to a T. Ain&rsquo;t much like Jerry&rsquo;s h&rsquo;af raw kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You needn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;, Perez,&rdquo; observed Captain Jerry, his mouth
      full of biscuit. &ldquo;When you was cook, you allers b&rsquo;iled &lsquo;em so hard they&rsquo;d
      dent the barn if you&rsquo;d fired &lsquo;em at it. How&rsquo;s John, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri gave his and the Doctor&rsquo;s opinion of his friend&rsquo;s condition
      and then said, &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ve got to have some kind of a settlement on this
      marryin&rsquo; question. Last night, when I was up in the room there, it come
      acrost me all of a sudden that, from what I&rsquo;d seen of this Nantucket
      woman, she&rsquo;d be jest the sort of nurse that John needed. So I skipped out
      while you fellers was busy with the Doctor, found her at the hotel,
      explained things to her, and got her to come down. That&rsquo;s all there is to
      that. I ain&rsquo;t made no arrangement with her, and somethin&rsquo;s got to be done.
      What do you think of her, jedgin&rsquo; by what you&rsquo;ve seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez gave it as his opinion that she was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; and added,
      &ldquo;If Jerry here wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so pigheaded all at once, he&rsquo;d marry her without
      waitin&rsquo; another minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eri nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idee,&rdquo; he said emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Jerry was as obstinate as ever. He simply would not consider
      immediate marriage. In vain his comrades reminded him of the original
      compact, and the fact that the vote was two to one against him; he
      announced that he had changed his mind, and that that was all there was
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Captain Eri lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you remind me of that old white hen we used to
      have. When we didn&rsquo;t want her to set she&rsquo;d set on anything from a doorknob
      to a rock, couldn&rsquo;t keep her off; but when we give in finally and got a
      settin&rsquo; of eggs for her, she wouldn&rsquo;t come nigher to &lsquo;em than the other
      end of the hen-yard. Now you might as well make up your mind that
      somethin&rsquo;s got to be done. This Mrs. Snow ain&rsquo;t nobody&rsquo;s fool. We put out
      a bait that anybody with sense would say couldn&rsquo;t catch nothin&rsquo; but
      sculpin, and, by mighty, we hooked a halibut! If the woman was anything
      like what you&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d be, answerin&rsquo; an advertisement like that, I&rsquo;d
      be the fust to say let her go, but she ain&rsquo;t; she&rsquo;s all right, and we need
      her to nuss John besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what we might do,&rdquo; said Perez slowly; &ldquo;we might explain to her
      that Jerry don&rsquo;t feel that &lsquo;twould be right to think of marryin&rsquo; with
      Cap&rsquo;n Baxter so sick in the house and that, if she&rsquo;s willin&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll put it
      off till he dies or gets better. Meantime, we&rsquo;ll pay her so much to stay
      here and nuss. Seems to me that&rsquo;s about the only way out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they agreed to lay this proposal before the Nantucket lady, Captain
      Jerry reluctantly consenting. Then Captain Eri took up another subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baxter, as has been said, had one relative, a granddaughter, living
      somewhere near Boston. Captain Eri felt that this granddaughter should be
      notified of the old man&rsquo;s illness at once. The difficulty was that none of
      them knew the young lady&rsquo;s address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her fust name&rsquo;s Elizabeth, same as her mothers was,&rdquo; said Eri, &ldquo;and her
      dad&rsquo;s name was Preston. They called her Elsie. John used to write to her
      every once in a while. P&rsquo;raps Sam would know where she lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest&rsquo; cause Sam&rsquo;s postmaster,&rdquo; observed Perez, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t foller that he
      reads the name on every letter that goes out and remembers &lsquo;em besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Captain Jerry decidedly, &ldquo;Mary Emma does. She
      reads everything, postals and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mary Emma Cahoon was the assistant at the post-office, and was
      possessed of a well-developed curiosity concerning other people&rsquo;s
      correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Eri, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so. We&rsquo;ll write the letter, and
      I&rsquo;ll ask Mary Emma for the address when I go up to mail it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Captain Perez went upstairs to take Mrs Snow&rsquo;s place as nurse, while
      that lady &ldquo;turned in.&rdquo; Captain Jerry went into the kitchen to wash the
      dishes, and Captain Eri sat down to write the note that should inform
      Elizabeth Preston of her grandfather&rsquo;s illness. It was a very short note,
      and merely stated the fact without further information. Having had some
      experience in that line, the Captain placed very little reliance upon the
      help to be expected from relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Palmer had spread the news as he went upon his round of visits that
      morning, and callers began to drop in to inquire after the sick man. Miss
      Busteed was one of the first arrivals, and, as Captain Eri had seen her
      through the window, he went upstairs and took Perez&rsquo; place as temporary
      nurse. To Perez, therefore, fell the delightful task of entertaining the
      voluble female for something like an hour, while she talked fire,
      paralysis, and general gossip at express speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Hazeltine came in a little later, and was introduced to Mrs. Snow,
      that lady&rsquo;s nap having been but a short one. Ralph was favorably impressed
      with the capable appearance of the new nurse, and so expressed himself to
      Captain Eri as they walked together toward the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; he said emphatically. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quiet and sensible and cheerful
      besides. She looks as if trouble didn&rsquo;t trouble her very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jedge she&rsquo;s seen enough of it in her time, too,&rdquo; observed the Captain
      reflectively. &ldquo;Queer thing how trouble acts different on folks. Kind of
      like hot weather, sours milk, but sweetens apples. She&rsquo;s one of the
      sweetened kind. And yet, I cal&rsquo;late she can be pretty sharp, too, if you
      try to tread on her toes. Sort of a sweet pickle, hey?&rdquo; and he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cahoon remembered the Preston girl&rsquo;s address. It was Cambridge,
      Kirkland Street, but the number, she did declare, had skipped her mind.
      The Captain said he would chance it without the number, so the letter was
      posted. Then, with the electrician, he strolled over to inspect the
      remains of the billiard saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a small crowd gathered about the building, prominent among its
      members being the &ldquo;train committee,&rdquo; who were evidently holding a special
      session on this momentous occasion. The busy &ldquo;Squealer,&rdquo; a trifle
      enlivened by some of Mr. Saunders&rsquo; wet goods that had escaped the efforts
      of the volunteer salvage corps, hailed the new arrivals as brother heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, Cap&rsquo;n Eri!&rdquo; he exclaimed, shaking hands vigorously. &ldquo;And Mr.
      Hazeltine, too! How&rsquo;re you feelin&rsquo; after last night? I says to Web, I
      says, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s folks in this town besides me that kept you from losin&rsquo; the
      whole thing and you ought to thank &lsquo;em,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;One of &lsquo;em &lsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Eri
      and t&rsquo;other one&rsquo;s Mr. Hazeltine. If we three didn&rsquo;t work, then <i>I</i>
      don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Web found out how the fire started yit?&rdquo; inquired the Captain with
      apparent unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he hain&rsquo;t for sure. There was a lot of us thought old Baxter might
      have set it, but they tell me it couldn&rsquo;t have been him, cause he was took
      down runnin&rsquo; to the fire. Web, he&rsquo;s sort of changed his tune, and don&rsquo;t
      seem to think anybody set it; thinks it catched itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders, his smooth self again, with all traces of mental disturbance
      gone from his face and all roughness from his tongue, came briskly up,
      smiling as if the burning of his place of business was but a trifling
      incident, a little annoying, of course, but not worth fretting about. He
      thanked the Captain and Hazeltine effusively for their service of the
      previous night, and piled the weight of his obligations upon them until,
      as Captain Eri said afterwards, &ldquo;the syrup fairly dripped off his chin.&rdquo;
       The Captain broke in upon the sugary flow as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you think it started, Web?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Saunders slowly, &ldquo;I kind of cal&rsquo;late she started
      herself. There was some of the boys in here most of the evenin&rsquo;, and, jest
      like&rsquo;s not, a cigar butt, or a match, or somethin&rsquo; dropped somewheres and
      got to smolderin&rsquo;, and smoldered along till bime-by&mdash;puff!&rdquo; An
      expressive wave of a fat hand finished the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted the Captain. &ldquo;Changed your mind sence last night. Seems
      to me I heard you then swearin&rsquo; you knew &lsquo;twas set and who set it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ye-es. I was considerable shook up last night and maybe I said
      things I hadn&rsquo;t ought to. You see there&rsquo;s been a good deal of hard
      feelin&rsquo;s towards me in town and for a spell I thought some feller&rsquo;d tried
      to burn me out. But I guess not; I guess not. More I think of it, more I
      think it catched itself. Seems to me I remember smellin&rsquo; sort of a
      scorchin&rsquo; smell when I was lockin&rsquo; up. Oh, say! I was mighty sorry to hear
      &lsquo;bout Cap&rsquo;n Baxter bein&rsquo; took sick. The old man was dreadful down on
      liquor, but I laid that to his religion and never had no hard feelin&rsquo;s
      against him. How&rsquo;s he gittin&rsquo; along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri brusquely replied that his friend was &ldquo;&lsquo;bout the same,&rdquo; and
      asked if Mr. Saunders intended to rebuild. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t know just yet. He
      was a poor man, didn&rsquo;t carry much insurance, and so on. Thought likely he
      should fix up again if it didn&rsquo;t cost too much. Did the Doctor say whether
      Captain Baxter would pull through or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri gave an evasive answer and turned away. He was silent for some
      little time, and when Ralph commented on &ldquo;Web&rsquo;s&rdquo; overnight change of
      manner, his rejoinder was to the effect that &ldquo;ile was bound to rise, but
      that didn&rsquo;t mean there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t dirty water underneath.&rdquo; On the way home he
      asked Hazeltine concerning the trouble at the cable station, and how Mr.
      Langley had treated the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph replied that Mr. Langley had said nothing to him about it. It was
      his opinion that the old gentleman understood the affair pretty well, and
      was not disposed to blame him. As for the men, they had been as docile as
      lambs, and he thought the feeling toward himself was not as bitter as it
      had been. All of which his companion said he was glad to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They separated at the gate, and the Captain entered the house to find Mrs.
      Snow wielding a broom and surrounded by a cloud of dust. Perez was
      upstairs with the patient, and Captain Jerry, whose habits had been
      considerably upset by the sweeping, was out in the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the situation was explained to Mrs. Snow by Captain Eri, in
      accordance with the talk at the breakfast table. The lady from Nantucket
      understood and respected Captain Jerry&rsquo;s unwillingness to discuss the
      marriage question while John Baxter&rsquo;s condition continued critical, and
      she agreed to act as nurse and housekeeper for a while, at least, for the
      sum of six dollars a week. This price was fixed only after considerable
      discussion by the three mariners, for Captain Eri was inclined to offer
      eight, and Captain Jerry but four.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ralph Hazeltine called late in the afternoon of the following day,
      the dining room was so transformed that he scarcely knew it. The dust had
      disappeared; the chronometer was polished till it shone; the table was
      covered with a cloth that was snow-white, and everything movable had the
      appearance of being in its place. Altogether, there was an evidence of
      order that was almost startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri came to the door in response to his knock, and grinned
      appreciatively at his caller&rsquo;s look of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you&rsquo;re s&rsquo;prised,&rdquo; he said, with a chuckle. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t begun
      to git over it yit, myself, and Lorenzo&rsquo;s so shook up he ain&rsquo;t been in the
      house sence breakfast time. He&rsquo;s out in the barn, keepin&rsquo; Dan&rsquo;l comp&rsquo;ny
      and waitin&rsquo; for the end of the world to strike, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed. &ldquo;Mrs. Snow?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Snow,&rdquo; answered the Captain. &ldquo;It beats all what a woman can do when
      she&rsquo;s that kind of a woman. She&rsquo;s done more swabbin&rsquo; decks and overhaulin&rsquo; 
      runnin&rsquo; riggin&rsquo; than a new mate on a clipper. The place is so all-fired
      clean that I feel like brushin&rsquo; myself every time I go to set down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Captain Baxter?&rdquo; asked Hazeltine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be some better. He come to a little this mornin&rsquo;, and seemed to
      know some of us, but he ain&rsquo;t sensed where he is yit, nor I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve
      he will fur a spell. Set down and keep me comp&rsquo;ny. It&rsquo;s my watch jest now.
      Perez, he&rsquo;s over to Barry&rsquo;s; Jerry&rsquo;s up to the schoolhouse, and Mrs.
      Snow&rsquo;s run up to the post-office to mail a letter. John&rsquo;s asleep, so I can
      stay downstairs a little while, long&rsquo;s the door&rsquo;s open. What&rsquo;s the news
      uptown? Web changed his mind ag&rsquo;in &lsquo;bout the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Mr. Saunders had not changed his mind, at least so
      current gossip reported. And it may be remarked here that, curiously
      enough, the opinion that the fire &ldquo;caught itself&rdquo; came at last to be
      generally accepted in the village. For some weeks Captain Eri was troubled
      with thoughts concerning the missing coat, but, as time passed, and the
      accusing garment did not turn up, he came to believe that some boy must
      have found it and that it had, in all probability, been destroyed. There
      were, of course, some persons who still suspected John Baxter as the
      incendiary, but the old man&rsquo;s serious illness and respect for his former
      standing in the community kept these few silent. The Baxter house had been
      locked up and the Captain had the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hazeltine and his host chatted for a few minutes on various topics. The
      gilt titles on the imposing &ldquo;Lives of Great Naval Commanders,&rdquo; having
      received their share of the general dusting, now shone forth resplendent,
      and the Captain noticed Ralph&rsquo;s eye as it involuntarily turned toward
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noticin&rsquo; our library?&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Perez&rsquo; property, that is. &lsquo;Gusty
      Black talked him into buyin&rsquo; &lsquo;em. Never met &lsquo;Gusty, did you? No, I guess
      likely not. She lives over to the Neck, and don&rsquo;t git down to the village
      much. &lsquo;Gusty&rsquo;s what you call a business woman. She&rsquo; always up to somethin&rsquo; 
      to make a dollar, and she&rsquo;s as slick a talker as ever was, I guess. She
      never give Perez no rest till he signed the deed for them books. Told him
      they&rsquo;d give liter&rsquo;ry tone to the shebang. Perez started to read &lsquo;em out
      loud when they fust come, but he had to stop so often to spell out the
      furrin names that me and Jerry used to go to sleep. That made him mad, and
      he said, liter&rsquo;ry tone be durned; he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to waste his breath
      readin&rsquo; us to sleep; so they&rsquo;ve been on the shelf ever sence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed. &ldquo;So you have book agents, too?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;Gusty,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s enough to keep us
      goin&rsquo;. Gits round reg&rsquo;lar as clockwork once a month to collect the two
      dollars from Perez. It&rsquo;s her day now, and I told Perez that that was why
      he sneaked off to Barry&rsquo;s. You see, &lsquo;Gusty&rsquo;s after him to buy the history
      of Methuselah, or some old critter, and he don&rsquo;t like to see her. She&rsquo;s
      after me, too, but I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid she don&rsquo;t git much encouragement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they had talked a little longer, the Captain seemed to remember
      something, for he glanced at his watch and said, &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine, I wonder
      if I could git you to do me a favor. I really ought to go down and see to
      my shanty. Ain&rsquo;t been there sence day afore yesterday, and there&rsquo;s so many
      boys &lsquo;round, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid to leave it unlocked much longer. I thought some
      of the folks would be back &lsquo;fore this, but if you could stay here long
      enough for me to run down there a minute or two, I&rsquo;d be ever so much
      obliged. I&rsquo;ll step up and see how John is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went upstairs and returned to report that the patient was quiet and
      seemed to be asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hear him groan, or anything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;jest come to the door and
      whistle. Whistle anyway, if you want me. Ain&rsquo;t nobody likely to come,
      &lsquo;less it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gusty or the Reverend Perley come to ask &lsquo;bout John. If it&rsquo;s a
      middlin&rsquo; good-lookin&rsquo; young woman with a satchel, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gusty. Don&rsquo;t
      whistle; tell her I&rsquo;m out. I&rsquo;ll be back in a jiffy, but you needn&rsquo;t tell
      either of them so unless your conscience hurts you TOO much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the Captain had gone Ralph took down a volume of the &ldquo;Great
      Commanders&rdquo; and sat down in a chair by the table to look it over. He was
      smiling over the gaudy illustrations and flamboyant descriptions of
      battles, when there was a step on the walk outside and knock at the door.
      &ldquo;Which is it,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;&lsquo;Gusty or the Reverend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obviously it was Miss Black. She stood on the mica slab that formed the
      step and looked up at him as he swung the door open. She had a small
      leather bag in her hand, just as the Captain had said she would have, but
      it flashed across Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s mind that the rest of the description
      was not a fair one; she was certainly much more than &ldquo;middlin&rsquo; 
      good-lookin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Captain Hedge in?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, from his friend&rsquo;s hints, Ralph had expected to hear a rather sharp
      and unpleasant voice,&mdash;certain disagreeable remembrances of former
      encounters with female book agents had helped to form the impression
      perhaps,&mdash;but Miss Black&rsquo;s voice was mellow, quiet, and rather
      pleasing than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Hazeltine, obeying orders with exactitude. &ldquo;Captain Hedge
      is out just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gusty&rdquo;&mdash;somehow the name didn&rsquo;t seem to fit&mdash;was manifestly
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she said, and then added, &ldquo;Will he be back soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this was a question unprovided for. Ralph stammered, and then
      miserably equivocated. He really couldn&rsquo;t say just when the Captain would
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said the young lady again. Then she seemed to be waiting for
      some further observation on the part of the gentleman at the door. None
      being forthcoming, she seemed to make up her mind to act on her own
      initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will come in and wait,&rdquo; she said with decision. And come in she
      did, Mr. Hazeltine not knowing exactly what to do, under the
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was much more in keeping with the electrician&rsquo;s preconceived
      ideas of a book agent&rsquo;s behavior; nevertheless, when he turned and found
      the young lady standing in the middle of the floor, he felt obliged to be
      at least decently polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take a chair?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the caller, and took one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was extremely awkward, but Ralph felt that loyalty to
      Captain Eri forbade his doing anything that might urge the self-possessed
      Miss Black to prolong her visit, so for a time he said nothing. The young
      lady looked out of the window and Mr. Hazeltine looked at her. He was more
      than ever of the opinion that the &ldquo;middlin&rsquo;&rdquo; term should be cut out of her
      description. He rather liked her appearance, so he decided. He liked the
      way she wore her hair; so simple an arrangement, but so effective. Also he
      liked her dress. It was the first tailor-made walking suit he had seen
      since his arrival in Orham. And worn by a country book agent, of all
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Miss Black turned and caught him intently gazing at her. She
      colored, apparently with displeasure, and looked out of the window again.
      Mr. Hazeltine colored also and fidgeted with the book on the table. The
      situation was confoundedly embarrassing. He felt that he must say
      something now, so he made the original observation that it had been a
      pleasant day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the young lady agreed, but there was no enthusiasm in her tone.
      Then Ralph, nervously fishing for another topic, thought of the book in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just reading this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I found it quite interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he realized that he had said what, of all things, was the
      most impolitic. It was nothing less than a bid for a &ldquo;canvass,&rdquo; and he
      fully expected to be confronted with the necessary order blanks without
      delay. But, strangely enough, the book lady made no such move. She looked
      at him, it is true, but with an expression of surprise and what seemed to
      be amusement on her face. He was certain that her lips twitched as she
      said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? I am glad to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This dispassionate remark was entirely unexpected, and the electrician, as
      Captain Eri would have said, &ldquo;lost his bearings&rdquo; completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er, yes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Very interesting indeed. I&mdash;I
      suppose you must take a good many orders in the course of a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many ORDERS?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. Orders for the books, I mean. The books&mdash;the &lsquo;Great Naval
      Lives&rsquo;&mdash;er&mdash;these books here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but who do you think I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was then that the perception of some tremendous blunder began to
      seize upon Mr. Hazeltine. He had been red before; now, he felt the redness
      creeping over his scalp under his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, Miss Black, I suppose; that is, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just here the door opened and Captain Eri came in. He took off his cap and
      then, seeing the visitor, remained standing, apparently waiting for an
      introduction. But the young lady did not keep him waiting long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Captain Eri Hedge?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; answered the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m SO glad. Your letter came this morning, and I hurried down on the
      first train. I&rsquo;m Elizabeth Preston.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ELSIE PRESTON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps, on the whole, it is not surprising that Captain Eri didn&rsquo;t grasp
      the situation. Neither his two partners nor himself had given much thought
      to the granddaughter of the sick man in the upper room. The Captain knew
      that there was a granddaughter, hence his letter; but he had heard John
      Baxter speak of her as being in school somewhere in Boston, and had all
      along conceived of her as a miss of sixteen or thereabouts. No wonder that
      at first he looked at the stylishly gowned young woman, who stood before
      him with one gloved hand extended, in a puzzled, uncomprehending way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said slowly, mechanically swallowing up the
      proffered hand in his own mammoth fist, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I jest caught
      the name. Would you mind sayin&rsquo; it ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth Preston,&rdquo; repeated the visitor. &ldquo;Captain Baxter&rsquo;s
      granddaughter. You wrote me that he was ill, you know, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; roared the Captain, delighted amazement lighting up his face like
      a sunrise. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you&rsquo;re &lsquo;Liz&rsquo;beth Baxter&rsquo;s gal Elsie!
      Well! Well! I want to know! If this don&rsquo;t beat all! Set down! Take your
      things right off. I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri&rsquo;s hand, with Miss Preston&rsquo;s hidden in it, was moving up and
      down as if it worked by a clock-work arrangement. The young lady withdrew
      her fingers from the trap as soon as she conveniently could, but it might
      have been noticed that she glanced at them when she had done so, as if to
      make sure that the original shape remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Captain Hedge,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now, please tell me about
      grandfather. How is he? May I see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s expression changed to one of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now, Miss Preston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your grandpa is pretty sick. Oh, I
      don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to die right off or anything like that,&rdquo; he added
      hastily. &ldquo;I mean he&rsquo;s had a stroke of palsy, or somethin&rsquo;, and he ain&rsquo;t
      got so yit that he senses much of what goes on. Now I don&rsquo;t want to
      frighten you, you know, but really there&rsquo;s a chance&mdash;a leetle mite of
      a chance&mdash;that he won&rsquo;t know you. Don&rsquo;t feel bad if he don&rsquo;t, now
      will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he must be very ill from your letter,&rdquo; said the girl simply. &ldquo;I
      was afraid that he might not be living when I reached here. They told me
      at the station that he was at your house and so I came. He has been very
      good to me and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice broke a little and she hesitated. Captain Eri was a picture of
      nervous distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry now. He&rsquo;s better;
      the Doctor said he was consid&rsquo;rably better to-day; didn&rsquo;t he, Mr.
      Hazeltine? Why, what am I thinkin&rsquo; of? Let me make you known to Mr.
      Hazeltine; next-door neighbor of ours; right acrost the road,&rdquo; and he
      waved toward the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph and Miss Preston shook hands. The electrician managed to utter some
      sort of formality, but he couldn&rsquo;t have told what it was. He was glad when
      the Captain announced that, if Mr. Hazeltine would excuse them, he guessed
      Miss Preston and he would step upstairs and see John. The young lady took
      off her hat and jacket, and Captain Eri lighted a lamp, for it was almost
      dark by this time. As its light shone upon the visitor&rsquo;s face and hair the
      crimson flush before mentioned circumnavigated the electrician&rsquo;s head once
      more, and his bump of self-esteem received a finishing blow. That any man
      supposed to possess two fairly good eyes and a workable brain could have
      mistaken her for an Orham Neck book agent by the name of &ldquo;&lsquo;Gusty&mdash;&lsquo;Gusty
      Black!&rdquo; Heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be down in a few minutes, Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Set
      still, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hazeltine wouldn&rsquo;t sit still. He announced that it was late and he
      must be going. And go he did, in spite of his host&rsquo;s protestations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for the stairs,&rdquo; cautioned the Captain, leading the way with the
      lamp. &ldquo;The feller that built &lsquo;em must have b&rsquo;lieved that savin&rsquo; distance
      lengthens out life. Come to think of it, I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if them stairs
      was the reason why me and Jerry and Perez took this house. They reminded
      us so of the shrouds on a three-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie Preston did her best to smile as her companion rattled on in this
      fashion, but both the smile and the Captain&rsquo;s cheerfulness were too
      plainly assumed to be convincing, and they passed down the hall in
      silence. At the open door of the sick room Captain Eri paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;and, remember, if he wakes up and doesn&rsquo;t
      know you, you needn&rsquo;t feel bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie slipped by him and knelt by the bed, looking into the white, old
      face on the pillow. Somehow the harsh lines had faded out of it, and it
      looked only old and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain watched the tableau for a moment or two, and then tiptoed into
      the room and placed the lamp on the bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I think likely,&rdquo; he said in a rather husky whisper, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d like
      to stay with your grandpa for a little while, so I&rsquo;ll go downstairs and
      see about supper. No, no, no!&rdquo; he added, holding up his hand as the girl
      spoke some words of protest, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; nowheres to supper. You&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to stay right here. If you want me, jest speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he hurried downstairs and into the kitchen, clearing his throat with
      vigor and making a great to-do over the scratching of a match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow returned a few minutes later and to her the news of the arrival
      was told, as it was also to Perez and Jerry when they came. Mrs. Snow took
      charge of the supper arrangements. When the meal was ready, she said to
      Captain Eri:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll go upstairs and tell her to come down. I&rsquo;ll stay with Cap&rsquo;n
      Baxter till you&rsquo;re through, and then p&rsquo;raps, if one of you&rsquo;ll take my
      place, I&rsquo;ll eat my supper and wash the dishes. You needn&rsquo;t come up now.
      I&rsquo;ll introduce myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some few minutes passed before Miss Preston came down. When she did so her
      eyes were wet, but her manner was cheerful, and the unaffected way in
      which she greeted Captain Perez and Captain Jerry, when these two rather
      bashful mariners were introduced by Eri, won them at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper was a great success. It was Saturday night, and a Saturday
      night supper to the average New Englander means baked beans. The captains
      had long ago given up this beloved dish, because, although each had tried
      his hand at preparing it, none had wholly succeeded, and the caustic
      criticisms of the other two had prevented further trials. But Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s
      baked beans were a triumph. So, also, was the brown bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I snum,&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Perez, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve I&rsquo;d sooner have
      these beans than turkey. What do you say, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I had,&rdquo; assented the sacrifice, upon whose countenance
      sat a placidity that had not been there since the night of the &ldquo;matching.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;&lsquo;Specially if the turkey was like the one we tried to cook last
      Thanksgivin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Member that, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, his mouth full, grunted an emphatic assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; said Miss Preston, who had eaten but little, but was apparently
      getting more satisfaction from watching her companions, &ldquo;did you three men
      try to keep house here alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Eri dryly. &ldquo;We tried. First we thought &lsquo;twas goin&rsquo; to be
      fine; then we thought we&rsquo;d like it better after we got used to it; finally
      we decided that by the time we got used to it we&rsquo;d die, like the horse
      that was fed on sawdust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you hired Mrs. Snow to keep house for you? Well, I don&rsquo;t see how
      you could have made a better choice; she&rsquo;s a dear, good woman; I&rsquo;m sure of
      it. And now I want to thank you all for what you&rsquo;ve done for grandfather.
      Mrs. Snow told me all about it; you&rsquo;ve been so kind that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right! that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; hastily interrupted Captain Eri.
      &ldquo;Pity if we couldn&rsquo;t help out a shipmate we&rsquo;ve sailed with for years and
      years. But you&rsquo;d ought to have tried some of OUR cookin&rsquo;. Tell her about
      the sugar cake you made, Perez. The one that killed the yaller chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Captain Perez told it, and then their visitor set them all laughing by
      relating some queer housekeeping experiences that she and a school friend
      had had while camping at Chautauqua. Somehow each one felt at home with
      her. As Captain Eri said afterwards, &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t giggle, and then ag&rsquo;in
      she didn&rsquo;t talk down at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they rose from the table the young lady asked a question concerning the
      location of the hotel. The Captain made no answer at the time, but after a
      short consultation with the remainder of the triumvirate, he came to her
      as she stood by the window and, laying his hand on her shoulder, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Elsie&mdash;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind my callin&rsquo; you Elsie, but I&rsquo;ve
      been chums with your grandpa so long seems&rsquo;s if you must be a sort of
      relation of mine&mdash;Elsie, you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to no hotel, that is, unless
      you&rsquo;re real set on it. Your grandpa&rsquo;s here and we&rsquo;re here, and there&rsquo;s
      room enough. I don&rsquo;t want to say too much, but I&rsquo;d like to have you
      b&rsquo;lieve that me and Perez and Jerry want you to stay right in this house
      jest as long&rsquo;s you stop in Orham. Now you will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled, and Captain Perez harnessed Daniel and went to the
      station for the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, just before going to bed, the captains stood by the door of
      the sick room watching Elsie and the lady from Nantucket as they sat
      beside John Baxter&rsquo;s bed. Mrs. Snow was knitting, and Elsie was reading.
      Later, as Captain Eri peered out of the dining-room window to take a final
      look at the sky in order to get a line on the weather, he said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellers, do you know what I was thinkin&rsquo; when I see them two women in
      there with John? I was thinkin&rsquo; that it must be a mighty pleasant thing to
      know that if you&rsquo;re took sick somebody like that &lsquo;ll take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez nodded. &ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this was meant to influence the betrothed one, it didn&rsquo;t succeed,
      apparently, for all Captain Jerry said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! &lsquo;Twould take more than that to make me hanker after a stroke of
      palsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the coming of Elsie Preston and Mrs. Snow life in the little
      house by the shore took on a decided change. The Nantucket lady having
      satisfied herself that John Baxter&rsquo;s illness was likely to be a long one,
      wrote several letters to persons in her native town, which letters,
      although she did not say so, were supposed by the captains to deal with
      the care of her property while she was away. Having apparently relieved
      her mind by this method, and evidently considering the marriage question
      postponed for the present, she settled down to nurse the sick man and to
      keep house as, in her opinion, a house should be kept. The captains knew
      nothing of her past history beyond what they had gathered from stray bits
      of her conversation. She evidently did not consider it necessary to tell
      anything further, and, on the other hand, asked no questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her care of Baxter she was more like a sister than a hired nurse. No
      wife could have been more tender in her ministrations or more devotedly
      anxious for the patient&rsquo;s welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her care of the house, she was neatness itself. She scoured and swept
      and washed until the rooms were literally spotless. Order was Heaven&rsquo;s
      first law, in her opinion, and she expected everyone else to keep up to
      the standard. Captain Perez and Captain Eri soon got used to the change
      and gloried in it, but to Captain Jerry it was not altogether welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cat&rsquo;s foot!&rdquo; he exclaimed one day, after hunting everywhere for his
      Sunday tie, and at length finding it in his bureau drawer. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t git
      used to this everlastin&rsquo; spruced-up bus&rsquo;ness. Way it used to be, this
      necktie was likely to be &lsquo;most anywheres &lsquo;round, and if I looked out in
      the kitchen or under the sofy, I was jest as likely to find it. But now
      everything&rsquo;s got a place and is in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the way it ought to be, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Eri. &ldquo;Then all
      you&rsquo;ve got to do is look in the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s jest it, I&rsquo;m always forgittin&rsquo; the place. My shoes is
      sech a place; my hankerchers is sech a place; my pipe is sech a place; my
      terbacker is another place. When I want my pipe I look where my shoes is,
      and when I want my shoes I go and look where I found my pipe. How a
      feller&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to keep run of &lsquo;em is what <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was the one that did most of the growlin&rsquo; when things was the old
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but jest &lsquo;cause a man don&rsquo;t want to live in a pigpen it ain&rsquo;t no
      sign he wants to be put under a glass case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie&rsquo;s influence upon the house and its inmates had become almost as
      marked as Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s. The young lady was of an artistic bent, and the
      stiff ornaments in the shut-up parlor and the wonderful oil-paintings
      jarred upon her. Strange to say, even the wax-dipped wreath that hung in
      its circular black frame over the whatnot did not appeal to her. The
      captains considered that wreath&mdash;it had been the principal floral
      offering at the funeral of Captain Perez&rsquo;s sister, and there was a lock of
      her hair framed with it&mdash;the gem of the establishment. They could
      understand, to a certain degree, why Miss Preston objected to the
      prominence given the spatter-work &ldquo;God bless our Home&rdquo; motto, but her
      failure to enthuse over the wreath was inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by degrees they became used to seeing the blinds open at the parlor
      windows the week through, and innovations like muslin curtains and vases
      filled with late wild flowers came to be at first tolerated and then
      liked. &ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s notions,&rdquo; the captains called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some great discussions on art, over the teacups after supper.
      Miss Preston painted very prettily in water-colors, and her sketches were
      received with enthusiastic praise by the captains and Mrs. Snow. But one
      day she painted a little picture of a fishing boat and, to her surprise,
      it came in for some rather sharp criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty picture, Elsie,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, holding the sketch at
      arm&rsquo;s length and squinting at it with his head on one side, &ldquo;but if that&rsquo;s
      Caleb Titcomb&rsquo;s boat, and I jedge &lsquo;tis, it seems to me she&rsquo;s carryin&rsquo; too
      much sail. What do you think, Jerry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry took the painting from his friend and critically examined
      it, also at arm&rsquo;s length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caleb&rsquo;s boat ain&rsquo;t got no sech sail as that,&rdquo; was his deliberate comment.
      &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t carry it and stand up that way. Besides, the way I look at
      it, she&rsquo;s down by the head more &lsquo;n she&rsquo;d ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t try to get it EXACTLY right,&rdquo; said the bewildered artist.
      &ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s sails were so white, and the water was so blue, and the sand
      so yellow that I thought it made a pretty picture. I didn&rsquo;t think of the
      size of the sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose you wouldn&rsquo;t, nat&rsquo;rally,&rdquo; observed Captain Perez, who was
      looking over Jerry&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;But you have to be awful careful paintin&rsquo; 
      vessels. Now you jest look at that picture,&rdquo; pointing to the glaring
      likeness of the Flying Duck, that hung on the wall. &ldquo;Jest look at them
      sails, every one of &lsquo;em drawin&rsquo; fine; and them ropes, every one in JEST
      the right place. That&rsquo;s what I call paintin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think, Captain Perez, that the waves in that picture would
      be better if they weren&rsquo;t so all in a row, like a picket fence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, that ain&rsquo;t it. That&rsquo;s a picture of the A1 two-masted schooner
      Flyin&rsquo; Duck, and the waves is only thrown in, as you might say. The reel
      thing is the schooner, rigged jest right, trimmed jest right, and colored
      jest the way the Flyin&rsquo; Duck was colored. You understand them waves was
      put there jest &lsquo;cause there had to be some to set the schooner in, that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t feel bad, Elsie,&rdquo; said Captain Jerry soothingly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
      to be expected that you could paint vessels like Eben Lothrop can. Eben he
      used to work in a shipyard up to East Boston once, and when he was there
      he had to paint schooners and things, reely put the paint onto &lsquo;em I mean,
      so, of course, when it come to paintin&rsquo; pictures of &lsquo;em, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Jerry waved his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as there was no answer to an argument like this, Miss Preston gave up
      marine painting for the time and began a water-color of the house and its
      inmates. This was an elaborate affair, and as the captains insisted that
      each member of the family, Daniel and Lorenzo included, should pose, it
      seemed unlikely to be finished for some months, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Hazeltine called on the afternoon following Elsie&rsquo;s arrival, and
      Captain Eri insisted on his staying to tea. It might have been noticed
      that the electrician seemed a trifle embarrassed when Miss Preston came
      into the room, but as the young lady was not embarrassed in the least, and
      had apparently forgotten the mistaken-identity incident, his nervousness
      soon wore off.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it came back again when Captain Eri said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Mr. Hazeltine, I forgot to ask you, did &lsquo;Gusty come
      yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph answered, rather hurriedly, that she did not. He endeavored to
      change the subject, but the Captain wouldn&rsquo;t let him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there!&rdquo; he exclaimed amazedly; &ldquo;if &lsquo;Gusty ain&rsquo;t broke her record!
      Fust time sence Perez was took with the &lsquo;Naval Commander&rsquo; disease that she
      ain&rsquo;t been on hand when the month was up, to git her two dollars. Got so
      we sort of reckoned by her like an almanac. Kind of thought she was sure,
      like death and taxes. And now she has gone back on us. Blessed if I ain&rsquo;t
      disapp&rsquo;inted in &lsquo;Gusty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;One of those book-agent critters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you called her that to her face, I expect there&rsquo;d be squalls,
      but I cal&rsquo;late she couldn&rsquo;t prove a alibi in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it may have been Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s fancy, but he could have sworn that
      there was just the suspicion of a twinkle in Miss Preston&rsquo;s eye as she
      asked, innocently enough:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a young lady, Captain Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she hopes she is,&rdquo; was the deliberate answer. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she look like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like YOU? Oh, my soul and body! Wait till you see her. What made you ask
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing! I was a little curious, that&rsquo;s all. Have you seen her, Mr.
      Hazeltine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph stammered, somewhat confusedly, that he hadn&rsquo;t had the pleasure. The
      Captain glanced from the electrician to Miss Preston and back again. Then
      he suddenly realized the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; he roared, slapping his knee and rocking back and forth in his
      chair. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t for the land&rsquo;s sake tell me you took Elsie here for &lsquo;Gusty
      Black! Don&rsquo;t now! Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me if I had taken many orders,&rdquo; remarked the young lady
      demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the general hilarity had abated a little Ralph penitently explained
      that it was dark, that Captain Eri had said Miss Black was young, and that
      she carried a bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did, so I did,&rdquo; chuckled the Captain. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose &lsquo;twas nat&rsquo;ral
      enough, but, oh dear, it&rsquo;s awful funny! Now, Elsie, you&rsquo;d ought to feel
      flattered. Wait till you see &lsquo;Gusty&rsquo;s hat, the one she got up to Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I forgiven, Miss Preston?&rdquo; asked Hazeltine, as he said good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the rather non-committal answer. &ldquo;I think I
      shall have to wait until I see &lsquo;Gusty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hazeltine apparently took his forgiveness for granted, for his
      calls became more and more frequent, until his dropping in after supper
      came to be a regular occurrence. Young people of the better class are
      scarce in Orham during the fall and winter months, and Ralph found few
      congenial companions. He liked the captains and Mrs. Snow, and Elsie&rsquo;s
      society was a relief after a day with the operators at the station. Mr.
      Langley was entirely absorbed in his business, and spent his evenings in
      his room, reading and smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      So September and October passed and November came. School opened in
      October and the captains had another boarder, for Josiah Bartlett, against
      his wishes, gave up his position as stage-driver, and was sent to school
      again. As the boy was no longer employed at the livery stable, Captain
      Perez felt the necessity of having him under his eye, and so Josiah lived
      at the house by the shore, a cot being set up in the parlor for his use.
      His coming made more work for Mrs. Snow, but that energetic lady did not
      seem to mind, and even succeeded in getting the youngster to do a few
      &ldquo;chores&rdquo; about the place, an achievement that won the everlasting
      admiration of Captain Perez, who had no governing power whatever over the
      boy, and condoned the most of his faults or scolded him feebly for the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baxter continued to waver between this world and the next. He had
      intervals of consciousness in which he recognized the captains and Elsie,
      but these rational moments were few and, although he talked a little, he
      never mentioned recent events nor alluded to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire itself became an old story and gossip took up other subjects. The
      &ldquo;Come-Outers&rdquo; held a jubilee service because of the destruction of the
      saloon, but, as &ldquo;Web&rdquo; soon began to rebuild and repair, their
      jollification was short-lived. As for Mr. Saunders, he was the same
      unctuous, smiling personage that he had formerly been. It was a curious
      fact, and one that Captain Eri noted, that he never ceased to inquire
      after John Baxter&rsquo;s health, and seemed honestly glad to hear of the old
      man&rsquo;s improvement. He asked a good many questions about Elsie, too, but
      received little satisfaction from the Captain on this subject.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MATCHMAKING AND LIFE-SAVING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry sat behind the woodshed, in the sunshine, smoking and
      thinking. He had done a good deal of the first ever since he was sixteen
      years old; the second was, in a measure, a more recent acquirement. The
      Captain had things on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those perfect, springlike mornings that sometimes come in
      early November. The sky was clear blue, and the air was so free from haze
      that the houses at Cranberry Point could be seen in every detail. The flag
      on the cable station across the bay stood out stiff in the steady breeze,
      and one might almost count the stripes. The pines on Signal Hill were a
      bright green patch against the yellow grass. The sea was a dark sapphire,
      with slashes of silver to mark the shoals, and the horizon was notched
      with sails. The boats at anchor in front of the shanties swung with the
      outgoing tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Captain Eri, also smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Captain Jerry. &ldquo;How is it you ain&rsquo;t off fishin&rsquo; a mornin&rsquo; 
      like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; else on the docket,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s matchmakin&rsquo; these
      days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now this question touched vitally the subject of Captain Jerry&rsquo;s thoughts.
      From a placid, easygoing retired mariner, recent events had transformed
      the Captain into a plotter, a man with a &ldquo;deep-laid scheme,&rdquo; as the
      gentlemanly, cigarette-smoking villain of the melodrama used to love to
      call it. To tell the truth, petticoat government was wearing on him. The
      marriage agreement, to which his partners considered him bound, and which
      he saw no way to evade, hung over him always, but he had put this threat
      of the future from his mind so far as possible. He had not found orderly
      housekeeping the joy that he once thought it would be, but even this he
      could bear. Elsie Preston was the drop too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked Mrs. Snow, except in a marrying sense. He liked Elsie better than
      any young lady he had ever seen. The trouble was, that between the two,
      he, as he would have expressed it, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have the peace of a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Elsie came, a game of checkers between Perez and himself had been
      the regular after-supper amusement. Now they played whist, Captain Eri and
      Elsie against him and his former opponent. As Elsie and her partner almost
      invariably won, and as Perez usually found fault with him because they
      lost, this was not an agreeable change. But it was but one. He didn&rsquo;t like
      muslin curtains in his bedroom, because they were a nuisance when he
      wanted to sit up in bed and look out of the window; but the curtains were
      put there, and everybody else seemed to think them beautiful, so he could
      not protest. Captain Perez and Captain Eri had taken to &ldquo;dressing up&rdquo; for
      supper, to the extent of putting on neckties and clean collars. Also they
      shaved every day. He stuck to the old &ldquo;twice-a-week&rdquo; plan for a while, but
      looked so scrubby by contrast that out of mere self-respect he had to
      follow suit. Obviously two females in the house were one too many.
      Something had to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Hazeltine&rsquo;s frequent calls gave him the inspiration he was looking
      for. This was to bring about a marriage between Ralph and Miss Preston.
      After deliberation he decided that if this could be done the pair would
      live somewhere else, even though John Baxter was still too ill to be
      moved. Elsie could come in every day, but she would be too busy with her
      own establishment to bother with the &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; of theirs. It wasn&rsquo;t a
      very brilliant plan and had some vital objections, but Captain Jerry
      considered it a wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broached it to his partners, keeping his real object strictly in the
      background and enlarging upon his great regard for Ralph and Elsie, and
      their obvious fitness for each other. Captain Perez liked the scheme well
      enough, provided it could be carried out. Captain Eri seemed to think it
      better to let events take their own course. However, they both agreed to
      help if the chance offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when Mr. Hazeltine called to spend the evening, Captain Jerry would
      rise from his chair and, with an elaborate cough and several surreptitious
      winks to his messmates, would announce that he guessed he would &ldquo;take a
      little walk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;go out to the barn,&rdquo; or something similar. Captain Perez
      would, more than likely, go also. As for Captain Eri, he usually
      &ldquo;cal&rsquo;lated&rdquo; he would step upstairs, and see how John was getting along.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of this loyal support, the results obtained from Captain
      Jerry&rsquo;s wonderful plan had not been so startlingly successful as to
      warrant his feeling much elated. Ralph and Elsie were good friends and
      seemed to enjoy each other&rsquo;s society, but that was all that might be
      truthfully said, so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry, therefore, was a little discouraged as he sat in the
      sunshine and smoked and pondered. He hid his discouragement, however, and
      in response to Captain Eri&rsquo;s question concerning the progress of the
      matchmaking, said cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; along, comin&rsquo; along. Kind of slow, of course, but you
      can&rsquo;t expect nothin&rsquo; diff&rsquo;rent. I s&rsquo;pose you noticed he was here four
      times last week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he was, and week a fore that &lsquo;twas only three. So that&rsquo;s a gain,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t count the time he stopped after a drink of water neither. That
      wasn&rsquo;t a real call, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ought to count for somethin&rsquo;! Call it a ha&rsquo;f a time. That would
      make four times and a ha&rsquo;f he was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry looked suspiciously at his friend&rsquo;s face, but its soberness
      was irreproachable, so he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s kind of slow work, but, as I said afore, it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; along,
      and I have the satisfaction of knowin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all for their good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like the feller that ate all the apple-dumplin&rsquo;s so&rsquo;s his children
      wouldn&rsquo;t have the stomach-ache. But say, Jerry, I come out to ask if you&rsquo;d
      mind bein&rsquo; housekeeper to-day. Luther Davis has been after me sence I
      don&rsquo;t know when to come down to the life-savin&rsquo; station and stay to
      dinner. His sister Pashy&mdash;the old maid one&mdash;is down there, and
      it&rsquo;s such a fine day I thought I&rsquo;d take Perez and Elsie and Mrs. Snow and,
      maybe, Hazeltine along. Somebody&rsquo;s got to stay with John, and I thought
      p&rsquo;raps you would. I&rsquo;d stay myself only Luther asked me so particular, and
      you was down there two or three months ago. When Josiah comes back from
      school he&rsquo;ll help you some, if you need him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry didn&rsquo;t mind staying at home, and so Eri went into the house
      to make arrangements for the proposed excursion. He had some difficulty in
      persuading Mrs. Snow and Elsie to leave the sick man, but both were tired
      and needed a rest, and there was a telephone at the station, so that news
      of a change in the patient&rsquo;s condition could be sent almost immediately.
      Under these conditions, and as Captain Jerry was certain to take good care
      of their charge, the two were persuaded to go. Perez took the dory and
      rowed over to the cable station to see if Mr. Hazeltine cared to make one
      of the party. When he returned, bringing the electrician with him, Daniel,
      harnessed to the carryall, was standing at the side door, and Captain Eri,
      Mrs. Snow, and Elsie were waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph glanced at the carryall, and then at those who were expected to
      occupy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better row down, Captain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how five of
      us are going to find room in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in a carryall?&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s what a
      carryall&rsquo;s for. I&rsquo;ve carried six in a carryall &lsquo;fore now. &lsquo;Twas a good
      while ago, though,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle, &ldquo;when I was consid&rsquo;rable
      younger &lsquo;n I am now. Squeezin&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t count in them days, &lsquo;specially if
      the girls wanted to go to camp-meetin&rsquo;. I cal&rsquo;late we can fix it. You and
      me&rsquo;ll set on the front seat, and the rest in back. Elsie ain&rsquo;t a very big
      package, and Perez, he&rsquo;s sort of injy-rubber; he&rsquo;ll fit in &lsquo;most
      anywheres. Let&rsquo;s try it anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And try it they did. While it was true that Elsie was rather small, Mrs.
      Snow was distinctly large, and how Captain Perez, in spite of his alleged
      elasticity, managed to find room between them is a mystery. He, however,
      announced that he was all right, adding, as a caution:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jolt none, Eri, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m kind of hangin&rsquo; on the little aidge of
      nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for you,&rdquo; answered his friend, picking up the reins. &ldquo;All
      ashore that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ashore. So long, Jerry. Git dap, Thousand Dollars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daniel complacently accepted this testimony to his monetary worth and
      jogged out of the yard. Fortunately appearances do not count for much in
      Orham, except in the summer, and the spectacle of five in a carryall is
      nothing out of the ordinary. They turned into the &ldquo;cliff road,&rdquo; the finest
      thoroughfare in town, kept in good condition for the benefit of the
      cottagers and the boarders at the big hotel. The ocean was on the left,
      and from the hill by the Barry estate&mdash;Captain Perez&rsquo; charge&mdash;they
      saw twenty miles of horizon line with craft of all descriptions scattered
      along it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schooners there were of all sizes, from little mackerel seiners to big
      four- and five-masters. A tug with a string of coal barges behind it was
      so close in that they could make out the connecting hawsers. A black
      freight steamer was pushing along, leaving a thick line of smoke like a
      charcoal mark on the sky. One square-rigger was in sight, but far out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you make of that bark, Perez?&rdquo; inquired Captain Eri, pointing to
      the distant vessel. &ldquo;British, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez leaned forward and peered from under his hand. &ldquo;French,
      looks to me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so. Way she&rsquo;s rigged for&rsquo;ard looks like Johnny Bull. Look at
      that fo&rsquo;tops&rsquo;l.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right, Eri, now I come to notice it. Can you make out her
      flag? Wish I&rsquo;d brought my glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, man!&rdquo; exclaimed Ralph. &ldquo;What sort of eyes have you got? I
      couldn&rsquo;t tell whether she had a flag or not at this distance. How do you
      do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to how you&rsquo;re brought up, as the goat said &lsquo;bout eatin&rsquo; 
      shingle-nails,&rdquo; replied Captain Eri. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re at sea you&rsquo;ve jest got
      to git used to seein&rsquo; things a good ways off and knowin&rsquo; &lsquo;em when you see
      &lsquo;em, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember, one time,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Snow, &ldquo;that my brother Nathan&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      dead now&mdash;was bound home from Hong Kong fust mate on the bark Di&rsquo;mond
      King. &lsquo;Twas the time of the war and the Alabama was cruisin&rsquo; &lsquo;round,
      lookin&rsquo; out for our ships. Nate and the skipper&mdash;a Bangor man he was&mdash;was
      on deck, and they sighted a steamer a good ways off. The skipper spied her
      and see she was flyin&rsquo; the United States flag. But when Nate got the glass
      he took one look and says, &lsquo;That Yankee buntin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;long over that
      English hull,&rsquo; he says. You see he knew she was English build right away.
      So the skipper pulled down his own flag and h&rsquo;isted British colors, but
      &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no use; the steamer was the Alabama sure enough, and the Di&rsquo;mond
      King was burned, and all hands took pris&rsquo;ners. Nate didn&rsquo;t git home for
      ever so long, and everybody thought he was lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This set the captains going, and they told sea-stories until they came to
      the road that led down to the beach beneath the lighthouse bluff. The
      lifesaving station was in plain sight now, but on the outer beach, and
      that was separated from them by a two-hundred-yard stretch of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Captain Eri, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where we take Adam&rsquo;s bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s bridge?&rdquo; queried Elsie, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the only kind he had, I cal&rsquo;late. Git dap, Daniel! What are you
      waitin&rsquo; for? Left your bathin&rsquo; suit to home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Daniel stepped rather gingerly into the clear water, he explained
      that, at a time ranging from three hours before low tide to three hours
      after, one may reach the outer beach at this point by driving over in an
      ordinary vehicle. The life-savers add to this time-limit by using a
      specially built wagon, with large wheels and a body considerably elevated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there now!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady from Nantucket, as Daniel
      splashingly emerged on the other side. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d done about
      everything a body could do with salt water, but I never went ridin&rsquo; in it
      afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the way to the station was covered by Daniel at a walk,
      for the wheels of the heavy carryall sank two inches or more in the coarse
      sand as they turned. The road wound between sand dunes, riven and heaped
      in all sorts of queer shapes by the wind, and with clumps of the
      persevering beach grass clinging to their tops like the last treasured
      tufts of hair on partially bald heads. Here and there, half buried,
      sand-scoured planks and fragments of spars showed, relics of wrecks that
      had come ashore in past winters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years ago,&rdquo; remarked Captain Eri, &ldquo;there was six foot of water where
      we are now. This beach changes every winter. One good no&rsquo;theaster jest
      rips things loose over here; tears out a big chunk of beach and makes a
      cut-through one season, and fills in a deep hole and builds a new shoal
      the next. I&rsquo;ve heard my father tell &lsquo;bout pickin&rsquo; huckleberries when he
      was a boy off where them breakers are now. Good dry land it was then. Hey!
      there&rsquo;s Luther. Ship ahoy, Lute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little brown life-saving station was huddled between two sand-hills.
      There was a small stable and a henhouse and yard just behind it. Captain
      Davis, rawboned and brown-faced, waved a welcome to them from the side
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spied you comin&rsquo;, Eri,&rdquo; he said in a curiously mild voice, that sounded
      odd coming from such a deep chest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see you, too? Jump
      down and come right in. Pashy &lsquo;ll be out in a minute. Here she is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Patience Davis was as plump as her brother was tall. She impressed
      one as a comfortable sort of person. Captain Eri did the honors and
      everyone shook hands. Then they went into the living room of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      What particularly struck Mrs. Snow was the neatness of everything. The
      brass on the pump in the sink shone like fire as the sunlight from the
      window struck it. The floor was white from scouring. There were shelves on
      the walls and on these, arranged in orderly piles, were canned goods of
      all descriptions. The table was covered with a figured oilcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three men, members of the crew, were seated in the wooden chairs
      along the wall, but rose as the party came in. Captain Davis introduced
      them, one after the other. Perhaps the most striking characteristic of
      these men was the quiet, almost bashful, way in which they spoke; they
      seemed like big boys, as much as anything, and yet the oldest was nearly
      fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever been in a life-saving station afore?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie had not. Ralph had and so had Mrs. Snow, but not for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is where we keep the boat and the rest of the gear,&rdquo; said Captain
      Davis, opening a door and leading the way into a large, low-studded room.
      &ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the spare oars on the wall. The reg&rsquo;lar ones are in the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat itself was on its carriage in the middle of the room. Along the
      walls on hooks hung the men&rsquo;s suits of oilskins and their sou&rsquo;westers. The
      Captain pointed out one thing after another, the cork jackets and
      life-preservers, the gun for shooting the life line across a stranded
      vessel, the life car hanging from the roof, and the &ldquo;breeches buoy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve you&rsquo;d ever git me into that thing,&rdquo; said the Nantucket
      lady decidedly, referring to the buoy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;d &lsquo;bout as
      liefs be drownded as make sech a show of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took off a bigger woman than you one time,&rdquo; said Captain Davis. &ldquo;Wife of
      a Portland skipper, she was, and he was on his fust v&rsquo;yage in a brand-new
      schooner jest off the stocks. Struck on the Hog&rsquo;s Back off here and then
      drifted close in and struck again. We got &lsquo;em all, the woman fust. That
      was the only time we&rsquo;ve used the buoy sence I&rsquo;ve been at the station. Most
      of the wrecks are too fur off shore and we have to git out the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took them upstairs to the men&rsquo;s sleeping rooms and then up to the
      little cupola on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you have ground-glass windows on this side of the house?&rdquo; asked
      Elsie, as they passed the window on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Davis laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is pretty nigh ground-glass now,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      when it was put in. The sand did that. It blows like all possessed when
      there&rsquo;s a gale on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that those windows were ground that way by the beach sand
      blowing against them?&rdquo; asked Ralph, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. Git a good no&rsquo;therly wind comin&rsquo; up the beach and it fetches the
      sand with it. Mighty mean stuff to face, sand blowin&rsquo; like that is; makes
      you think you&rsquo;re fightin&rsquo; a nest of yaller-jackets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the telescope in the cupola they could see for miles up and down the
      beach and out to sea. An ocean tug bound toward Boston was passing, and
      Elsie, looking through the glass, saw the cook come out of the galley,
      empty a pan over the side, and go back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me look through that a minute,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, when the rest had
      had their turn. He swung the glass around until it pointed toward their
      home away up the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; he called anxiously, &ldquo;look here quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez hastily put his eye to the glass, and his friend went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see our house?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes; well, you see the dinin&rsquo;-room door.
      Notice that chair by the side of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the rocker that Elsie made the velvet cushion for. I want
      you to look at the upper southeast corner of that cushion, and see if
      there ain&rsquo;t a cat&rsquo;s hair there. Lorenzo&rsquo;s possessed to sleep in that
      chair, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you git out!&rdquo; indignantly exclaimed Captain Perez, straightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a pretty important thing, and I wanted to make sure. I left
      that chair out there, and I knew what I&rsquo;d catch if any cat&rsquo;s hairs got on
      that cushion while I was gone. Ain&rsquo;t that so, Mrs. Snow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper expressed her opinion that Captain Eri was a &ldquo;case,&rdquo;
       whatever that may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had clam chowder for dinner&mdash;a New England clam chowder, made
      with milk and crackers, and clams with shells as white as snow. They were
      what the New Yorker calls &ldquo;soft-shell&rdquo; clams, for a Fulton Market chowder
      is a &ldquo;quahaug soup&rdquo; to the native of the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that chowder was good; everybody said so, and if the proof of the
      chowder, like that of the pudding, is in the eating of it, this one had a
      clear case. Also, there were boiled striped bass, which is good enough for
      anybody, hot biscuits, pumpkin pie, and beach-plum preserves. There was a
      running fire of apologies from Miss Patience and answering volleys of
      compliments from Mrs. Snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you make sech beach-plum preserves, Miss Davis,&rdquo;
       exclaimed the lady from Nantucket. &ldquo;I declare! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask you for
      another sasserful. I b&rsquo;lieve they&rsquo;re the best I ever ate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now! Do you think so? I kind of suspected that the plums was a
      little mite too ripe. You know how &lsquo;tis with beach-plums, they&rsquo;ve got to
      be put up when they&rsquo;re jest so, else they ain&rsquo;t good for much. I was at
      Luther for I don&rsquo;t know how long &lsquo;fore I could git him to go over to the
      P&rsquo;int and pick &lsquo;em, and I was &lsquo;fraid he&rsquo;d let it go too long. I only put
      up twenty-two jars of &lsquo;em on that account. How much sugar do you use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was material here for the discussion that country housewives love,
      and the two ladies took advantage of it. When it was over the female
      portion of the company washed the dishes, while the men walked up and down
      the beach and smoked. Here they were joined after a while by the ladies,
      for even by the ocean it was as mild as early May, and the wind was merely
      bracing and had no sting in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big blue waves shouldered themselves up from the bosom of the sea,
      marched toward the beach, and tumbled to pieces in a roaring tumult of
      white and green. The gulls skimmed along their tops or dropped like
      falling stones into the water after sand eels, emerging again, screaming,
      to repeat the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation naturally turned to wrecks, and Captain Davis, his
      reserve vanishing before the tactful inquiries of the captains and Ralph,
      talked shop and talked it well.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HEROES AND A MYSTERY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Luther Davis had been commandant at the life-saving station for years and
      &ldquo;Number One Man&rdquo; before that, so his experience with wrecks and disabled
      craft of all kinds had been long and varied. He told them of disasters the
      details of which had been telegraphed all over the country, and of rescues
      of half-frozen crews from ice-crested schooners whose signals of distress
      had been seen from the observatory on the roof of the station. He told of
      long rows in midwinter through seas the spray of which turned to ice as
      they struck, and froze the men&rsquo;s mittens to the oar-handles. He told of
      picking up draggled corpses in the surf at midnight, when, as he said,
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t tell whether &lsquo;twas a man or a roll of seaweed, and the only
      way to make sure was to reach down and feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri left them after a while, as he had some acquaintances among
      the men at the station, and wished to talk with them. Miss Davis
      remembered that she had not fed the chickens, and hurried away to perform
      that humane duty, gallantly escorted by Captain Perez. The Captain, by the
      way, was apparently much taken with the plump spinster and, although
      usually rather bashful where ladies were concerned, had managed to keep up
      a sort of side conversation with Miss Patience while the storytelling was
      going on. But Ralph and Elsie and Mrs. Snow were hungry for more tales,
      and Captain Davis obligingly told them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the wust wrecks we ever had off here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the Bluebell,
      British ship, she was: from Singapore, bound to Boston, and loaded with
      hemp. We see her about off that p&rsquo;int there, jest at dusk, and she was
      makin&rsquo; heavy weather then. It come on to snow soon as it got dark, and
      blow&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk! Seems to me &lsquo;twas one of the meanest nights I ever
      saw. &lsquo;Tween the snow flyin&rsquo; and the dark you couldn&rsquo;t see two feet ahead
      of you. We was kind of worried about the vessel all evenin&rsquo;&mdash;for one
      thing she was too close in shore when we see her last&mdash;but there
      wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to be done except to keep a weather eye out for signs of
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust thing we knew of the wreck was when the man on patrol up the beach&mdash;Philander
      Vose &lsquo;twas&mdash;telephoned from the shanty that a ship&rsquo;s long-boat had
      come ashore at Knowles&rsquo; Cove, two mile above the station. That was about
      one o&rsquo;clock in the mornin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Bout h&rsquo;af-past two Sim Gould&mdash;he was
      drownded the next summer, fishin&rsquo; on the Banks&mdash;telephoned from the
      shanty BELOW the station&mdash;the one a mile or so &lsquo;tother side of the
      cable house, Mr. Hazeltine&mdash;that wreckage was washin&rsquo; up abreast of
      where he was; that was six miles from where the longboat come ashore. So
      there we was. There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any way of tellin&rsquo; whereabouts she was layin&rsquo;;
      she might have been anywheres along them six miles, and you couldn&rsquo;t hear
      nothin&rsquo; nor see nothin&rsquo;. But anyhow, the wreckage kept comin&rsquo; in below the
      cable station, so I jedged she was somewheres in that neighborhood and we
      got the boat out&mdash;on the cart, of course&mdash;and hauled it down
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a tremendous job, too, that haulin&rsquo; was. We had the horse and the
      whole of us helpin&rsquo; him, but I swan! I begun to think we&rsquo;d never git
      anywheres. &lsquo;Tween the wind and the sand and the snow I thought we&rsquo;d flap
      to pieces, like a passel of shirts on a clothes line. But we got there
      after a spell, and then there was nothin&rsquo; to do but wait for daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout seven o&rsquo;clock the snow let up a little bit, and then we see her.
      There was a bar jest about opposite the cable station&mdash;it&rsquo;s been
      washed away sence&mdash;and she&rsquo;d struck on that, and the sea was makin&rsquo; a
      clean breach over her. There was a ha&rsquo;f a dozen of her crew lashed in the
      riggin&rsquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t see &lsquo;em move, so I presume likely they was froze
      stiff then, for &lsquo;twas perishin&rsquo; cold. But we wrastled the boat down to the
      water and was jest goin&rsquo; to launch her when the whole three masts went by
      the &lsquo;board, men and all. We put off to her, but she was in a reg&rsquo;lar
      soapsuds of a sea and awash from stem to stern, so we knew there was
      nothin&rsquo; livin&rsquo; aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, siree,&rdquo; continued the Captain meditatively, &ldquo;that was a mean night.
      I had this ear frost-bit, and it&rsquo;s been tender ever sence. One of the
      fellers had a rib broke; he was a little light chap, and the wind jest
      slammed him up against the cart like as if he was a chip. And jest to show
      you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;how the tide runs around this place, the bodies of that
      crew was picked up from Wellmouth to Setuckit P&rsquo;int&mdash;twenty-mile
      stretch that is. The skipper&rsquo;s body never come ashore. He had a son, nice
      young feller, that was goin&rsquo; to meet him in Boston, and that boy spent a
      month down here, waitin&rsquo; for his father&rsquo;s body to be washed up. He&rsquo;d walk
      up and down this beach, and walk up and down. Pitiful sight as ever I
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they were all lost?&rdquo; asked Elsie with a shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man Jack. But &lsquo;twas cu&rsquo;rus about that hemp. The Bluebell was loaded
      with it, as I told you, and when she went to pieces the tide took that
      hemp and strung it from here to glory. They picked it up all &lsquo;longshore,
      and for much as a month afterwards you&rsquo;d go along the &lsquo;main road&rsquo; over in
      the village, and see it hung over fences or spread out in the sun to dry.
      Looked like all the blonde girls in creation had had a hair-cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Davis,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;you must have seen some plucky things in
      your life. What was the bravest thing you ever saw done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The life saver took the cigar that Hazeltine had given him from his mouth,
      and blew the smoke into the air over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly. I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty
      gritty things done &lsquo;long-shore here, in the service. When there&rsquo;s somebody
      drowndin&rsquo;, and you know there&rsquo;s a chance to save &lsquo;em, you&rsquo;ll take chances,
      and think nothin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em, that you wouldn&rsquo;t take if you had time to set
      down and cal&rsquo;late a little. I see somethin&rsquo; done once that may not strike
      you as bein&rsquo; anything out of the usual run, but that has always seemed to
      me clear grit and nothin&rsquo; else. &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t savin&rsquo; life neither; &lsquo;twas jest a
      matter of bus&rsquo;ness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened up off the coast of Maine &lsquo;long in the seventies. I was
      actin&rsquo; as sort of second mate on a lumber schooner. &lsquo;Twas a pitch-black
      night, or mornin&rsquo; rather, &lsquo;bout six o&rsquo;clock, blowin&rsquo; like all possessed
      and colder &lsquo;n Greenland. We struck a rock that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t even down on an
      Eldredge chart and punched a hole in the schooner&rsquo;s side, jest above what
      ought to have been the water line, only she was heeled over so that &lsquo;twas
      consider&rsquo;ble below it most of the time. We had a mean crew aboard,
      Portugees mainly, and poor ones at that. The skipper was below, asleep,
      and when he come on deck things was in a bad way. We&rsquo;d got the canvas off
      her, but she was takin&rsquo; in water every time she rolled, and there was a
      sea goin&rsquo; that was tearin&rsquo; things loose in great shape. We shipped one old
      grayback that ripped off a strip of the lee rail jest the same as you&rsquo;d
      rip the edge off the cover of a pasteboard box&mdash;never made no more
      fuss about it, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; to do but get out the boats, but the skipper he
      wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that kind. He sized things up in a hurry, I tell you. He drove the
      crew&mdash;ha&rsquo;f of &lsquo;em was prayin&rsquo; to the Virgin and t&rsquo;other ha&rsquo;f swearin&rsquo; 
      a blue streak&mdash;to the pumps, and set me over &lsquo;em with a revolver to
      keep &lsquo;em workin&rsquo;. Then him and the fust mate and one or two of the best
      hands rousted out a spare sail, weighted one edge of it to keep it down,
      and got it over the side, made fast, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then him and the mate stripped to their underclothes, rigged a sort of
      bos&rsquo;n&rsquo;s chair over where the hole in the side was, took hammers and a
      pocketful of nails apiece, and started in to nail that canvas over the
      hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas freezin&rsquo; cold, and the old schooner was rollin&rsquo; like a washtub. One
      minute I&rsquo;d see the skipper and the mate h&rsquo;isted up in the air, hammerin&rsquo; 
      for dear life, and then, swash! under they&rsquo;d go, clear under, and stay
      there, seemed to me, forever. Every dip I thought would be the end, and
      I&rsquo;d shet my eyes, expectin&rsquo; to see &lsquo;em gone when she lifted; but no, up
      they&rsquo;d come, fetch a breath, shake the salt water out of their eyes, and
      go to work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hours and a quarter they was at it, four hours, mind you, and under
      water a good ha&rsquo;f of the time; but they got that sail nailed fast fin&rsquo;lly.
      We got &lsquo;em on deck when &lsquo;twas done, and we had to carry the fust mate to
      the cabin. But the skipper jest sent the cook for a pail of bilin&rsquo; hot
      coffee, drunk the whole of it, put on dry clothes over his wet flannels,
      and stayed on deck and worked that schooner into Portland harbor, the men
      pumpin&rsquo; clear green water out of the hold every minute of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that always seemed to me to be the reel thing. &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a question
      of savin&rsquo; life&mdash;we could have took to the boats and, nine chances out
      of ten, got ashore all right, for &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t very fur. But no, the skipper
      said he&rsquo;d never lost a vessel for an owner yit and he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to lose
      this one. And he didn&rsquo;t either, by Judas! No, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was splendid!&rdquo; exclaimed Elsie. &ldquo;I should like to have known that
      captain. Who was he, Captain Davis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the fust mate was Obed Simmons&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead now&mdash;but he
      used to live over on the road towards East Harniss. The skipper&mdash;well,
      he was a feller you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas Cap&rsquo;n Eri,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, ma&rsquo;am. Perez told you, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nobody told me. I jest guessed it. I&rsquo;ve seen a good many folks in my
      time, and I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ve got so I can tell what kind a man is after I&rsquo;ve
      known him a little while. I jedged Cap&rsquo;n Eri was that kind, and, when you
      said we knew that skipper, I was almost sartin &lsquo;twas him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Ralph, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I should have guessed it. I&rsquo;ve
      always liked the Captain, but he has seemed so full of fun and so
      easy-going that I never thought of his doing anything quite so strenuous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Davis laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen fo&rsquo;mast hands try to take advantage of
      that easy-goin&rsquo; way &lsquo;fore now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they never did it but once.
      Cap&rsquo;n Eri is one of the finest fellers that ever stepped, but you can&rsquo;t
      stomp on his toes much, and he&rsquo;s clear grit inside. And say,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you tell anybody I told that story, for he&rsquo;d skin me alive if he
      knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they walked back toward the station Ralph and Elsie lingered a little
      behind the others, and then stopped to watch a big four-master that, under
      full sail, was spinning along a mile or two from the beach. They watched
      it for a moment or two without speaking. Elsie&rsquo;s cheeks were brown from
      the sun, stray wisps of her hair fluttered in the wind, and her trim,
      healthy figure stood out against the white sandhill behind them as if cut
      from cardboard. The electrician looked at her, and again the thought of
      that disgraceful &ldquo;&lsquo;Gusty&rdquo; Black episode was forced into his mind. They had
      had many a good laugh over it since, and Elsie had apparently forgotten
      it, but he had not, by a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the first to speak, and then as much to herself as to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they are the best people I ever knew,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all of them! The captains and Mrs. Snow, and Captain Davis and his
      sister. They are so simple and kind and generous. And the best of it is,
      they don&rsquo;t seem to know it, and wouldn&rsquo;t believe it if you told them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph nodded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine it would take a good deal to convince Davis or any of these
      station men that there was anything heroic in their lives,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As
      for Captain Eri, I have known him only a month or two, but I don&rsquo;t know of
      anyone to whom I would rather go if I were in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been so kind to grandfather and me,&rdquo; said Elsie, &ldquo;that I feel as
      though we were under an obligation we never could repay. When I came down
      here I knew no one in Orham, and he and Captain Jerry and Captain Perez
      have made me feel more at home than I have ever felt before. You know,&rdquo;
       she added, &ldquo;grandfather is the only relative I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will go back to your studies when your grandfather
      recovers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If grandfather is well enough I think I shall try to
      persuade him to come up to Boston and live with me. Then I might perhaps
      teach. This was to have been my last year at Radcliffe, so my giving it up
      will not make so much difference. Do you intend to stay here long? I
      suppose you do. Your profession, I know, means so much to you, and your
      work at the station must be very interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be more so if I had someone who was interested with me. Mr.
      Langley is kind, but he is so wrapped up in his own work that I see very
      little of him. I took the place because I thought it would give me a good
      deal of spare time that I might use in furthering some experiments of my
      own. Electricity is my hobby, and I have one or two ideas that I am
      foolish enough to hope may be worth developing. I have had time enough,
      goodness knows, but it&rsquo;s a lonesome sort of life. If it had not been for
      the captains&mdash;and you&mdash;I think I should have given it up before
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, because it seems like running away, almost, doesn&rsquo;t it? If
      a thing is hard to do, but is worth doing, I think the satisfaction IN
      doing it is ever so much greater, don&rsquo;t you? I know it must be lonely for
      you; but, then, it is lonely for Mr. Langley and the other men, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Langley would be happy anywhere else, and the other men
      are married, most of them, and live over in the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, there isn&rsquo;t any real reason why this simple remark should have caused
      a halt in the conversation, but it did. Miss Preston said, &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo;
       rather hurriedly, and her next speech was concerning the height of a
      particularly big wave. Mr. Hazeltine answered this commonplace somewhat
      absent-mindedly. He acted like a man to whom a startling idea had suddenly
      occurred. Just then they heard Captain Eri calling them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was standing on a sand dune near the station, shouting their
      names through a speaking trumpet formed by placing his hands about his
      mouth. As the pair came strolling toward him, he shifted his hands to his
      trousers pockets and stood watching the young couple with a sort of half
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose if Jerry was here now,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d think his scheme was
      workin&rsquo;. Well, maybe &lsquo;tis, maybe &lsquo;tis. You can&rsquo;t never tell. Well, I
      swan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation was called forth by the sight of Captain Perez and Miss
      Patience, who suddenly came into view around the corner of the station.
      The Captain was gallantly assisting his companion over the rough places in
      the path, and she was leaning upon his arm in a manner that implied
      implicit confidence. Captain Eri glanced from one couple to the other, and
      then grinned broadly. The grin had not entirely disappeared when Captain
      Perez came up, and the latter rather crisply asked what the joke was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I was jest thinkin&rsquo; we must be playin&rsquo; some
      kind of a game, and I was It.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It?&rdquo; queried Miss Patience, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. I&rsquo;m kinder like &lsquo;Rastus Bailey used to be at the dances when
      you and me was younger, Perez. Old man Alexander&mdash;he was the fiddler&mdash;used
      to sing out &lsquo;Choose partners for Hull&rsquo;s Vict&rsquo;ry,&rsquo; or somethin&rsquo; like that,
      and it always took &lsquo;Ras so long to make up his mind what girl to choose
      that he gin&rsquo;rally got left altogether. Then he&rsquo;d set on the settee all
      through the dance and say he never cared much for Hull&rsquo;s Vict&rsquo;ry, anyway.
      Seems to me, I&rsquo;m the only one that ain&rsquo;t choosed partners. How &lsquo;bout it,
      Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool you, that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; replied Captain Perez
      stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Patience laughed so heartily at this rejoinder that Perez began to
      think he had said a very good thing indeed, and so repeated it for greater
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to look out for him, Miss Davis,&rdquo; said Captain Eri. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
      most fascinatin&rsquo; youngster of his age I ever see. Me and Jerry&rsquo;s been
      thinkin&rsquo; we&rsquo;d have to build a fence &lsquo;round the house to keep the girls
      away when he&rsquo;s home. Why, M&rsquo;lissy Busteed fairly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, give us a rest, Eri!&rdquo; exclaimed Perez, with even more indignation
      than was necessary. &ldquo;M&rsquo;lissy Busteed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Ralph and Elsie came up, and Captain Eri explained that he had
      hailed them because it was time to be going if they wanted to get across
      to the mainland without swimming. They walked around to the back door of
      the station and there found Mrs. Snow and Captain Davis by the hen-yard.
      The lady from Nantucket had discovered a sick chicken in the collection,
      and she was holding it in her lap and at the same time discoursing
      learnedly on the relative value of Plymouth Rocks and Rhode Island Reds,
      as layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See there!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Eri delightedly, pointing to the suffering
      pullet, &ldquo;what did I tell you? D&rsquo;you wonder we picked her out for nuss for
      John, Luther? Even a sick hen knows enough to go to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They harnessed Daniel to the carryall, and stowed the living freight
      aboard somehow, although Captain Perez protested that he had eaten so much
      dinner he didn&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he&rsquo;d be able to hang on the way he did coming
      down. Then they said farewell to Captain Davis and his sister and started
      for home. The members of the crew, such of them as were about the station,
      waved good-by to them as they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things kind of average up in this world, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Captain Eri
      reflectively, as he steered Daniel along the soft beach toward the ford.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all the time readin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout fellers that work for the Gov&rsquo;ment
      gittin&rsquo; high sal&rsquo;ries and doin&rsquo; next to nothin&rsquo;. Now there&rsquo;s a gang&mdash;the
      life-savin&rsquo; crew, I mean&mdash;that does what you and me would call
      almighty hard work and git next to nothin&rsquo; for it. Uncle Sam gits square
      there, it seems to me. A few dollars a month and find yourself ain&rsquo;t
      gilt-edged wages for bein&rsquo; froze and drownded and blown to pieces ten
      months out of the year, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tide was higher when they came to the crossing than it had been when
      they drove over before, but they made the passage all right, although
      there was some nervousness displayed by the feminine portion of the party.
      When they reached home they found Captain Jerry contentedly smoking his
      pipe, the sick man was asleep, and everything was serene. Josiah appeared
      from behind the barn, where he had been smoking a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pressed Mr. Hazeltine to stay to supper, but he declined, alleging
      that he had been away from business too long already. He had been
      remarkably silent during the homeward ride, and Elsie, too, had seemed
      busy with her thoughts. She was full of fun at the supper table, however,
      and the meal was a jolly one. Just as it was finished Captain Jerry struck
      the table a bang with his palm that made the knives and forks jump, and so
      startled Captain Perez as to cause him to spill half a cup of tea over his
      shirt bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land of love!&rdquo; ejaculated the victim, mopping his chin and his tie with
      his napkin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough to scare a feller to death, let alone
      drowndin&rsquo; and scaldin&rsquo; him at the same time. What did you do that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest thought of somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Jerry, going through one
      pocket after the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish you&rsquo;d have your thinkin&rsquo; fits in the barn or somewheres else
      next time. I put this shirt on clean this mornin&rsquo; and now look at it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend was too busy to pay any attention to this advice. The pocket
      search apparently being unsatisfactory, he rose from the table and
      hurriedly made a round of the room, looking on the mantelpiece and under
      chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had it when I come in,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;I know I did, &lsquo;cause I was
      wearin&rsquo; it when I went out to see to the hens. I don&rsquo;t see where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s your hat you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; observed Josiah, &ldquo;I saw Mrs. Snow
      hang it up on the nail behind the door. There it is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply to this was merely a grunt, which may, or may not have expressed
      approval. At any rate, the hat was apparently the object of his search,
      for he took it from the nail, looked inside, and with a sigh of relief
      took out a crumpled envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew I put it somewheres,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a letter for you, Elsie.
      Josiah, here, he brought it down from the post-office when he come from
      school this afternoon. I meant to give it to you afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, who sat next to the young lady, noticed that the envelope was
      addressed in an irregular, sprawling hand to &ldquo;Miss Elizabeth Preston,
      Orham, Mass.&rdquo; Elsie looked it over in the absent way in which so many of
      us examine the outside of a letter which comes unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder who it is from,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not open it at once, but, tucking it into her waist, announced
      that she must run upstairs, in order that Mrs. Snow might come down to
      supper. The housekeeper did come down a few minutes later, and, as she was
      interested to know more about Luther Davis and his sister, the talk became
      animated and general.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after eight o&rsquo;clock when Mrs. Snow, having finished washing the
      dishes&mdash;she allowed no one to assist her in this operation since the
      time when she caught Captain Jerry absent-mindedly using the dust rag
      instead of the dishcloth&mdash;went upstairs to her patient. Shortly
      afterward Elsie came down, wearing her hat and jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for a little while,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want anyone to
      go with me. I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her back was turned to the three captains as she spoke, but, as she opened
      the door, the lamplight shone for an instant on her face, and Captain Eri
      noticed, or fancied that he did, that she was paler than usual. He rose,
      and again offered to accompany her, but met with such a firm refusal that
      he could not insist further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s kind of funny, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; remarked Perez. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve
      she&rsquo;s been out alone afore after dark sence she&rsquo;s been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you git that letter, Josiah?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may as well be explained here that Captain Perez&rsquo; grand-nephew was a
      thorn in the flesh to everyone, including his indulgent relative. He was a
      little afraid of Mrs. Snow, and obeyed her better than he did anyone else,
      but that is not saying a great deal. He was in mischief in school
      two-thirds of the time, and his reports, made out by the teacher, were
      anything but complimentary. He was a good-looking boy, the image of his
      mother, who had been her uncle&rsquo;s favorite, and he was popular with a
      certain class of youngsters. Also, and this was worse, his work at the
      livery stable had thrown him in contact with a crowd of men like
      &ldquo;Squealer&rdquo; Wixon, &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders, and others of their class, and they
      appreciated his New York street training and made much of him. Captain
      Perez, mindful of his promise to the boy&rsquo;s mother, did not use the
      necessary measures to control him, and Captain Eri and Captain Jerry did
      not like to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now he was seated in the corner, and he looked up with a start,
      hurriedly folded up the tattered paper book he was reading, stuffed it
      into his pocket, and said, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who give you that letter that come for Elsie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Cahoon up at the office. It was in our box,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! What are you readin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s so interestin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;. A book, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josiah hesitated, looked as if he would like to refuse, and then sullenly
      took the ragged volume from his pocket and handed it to the Captain, who
      deliberately unfolded it, and looked at the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fightin&rsquo; Fred Starlight, the Boy Rover of the Pacific,&rsquo;&rdquo; he read aloud.
      &ldquo;Humph! Is it good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet your life! It&rsquo;s a red-hot story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know! Who was Mr. Moonshine&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;Starlight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a sailor,&rdquo; was the sulky answer. Josiah was no fool, and knew when
      he was being made fun of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain opened the book, and read a page or two to himself. Then he
      said, &ldquo;I see he knocked the skipper down &lsquo;cause he insulted him. Nice,
      spunky chap; I&rsquo;d like to have had him aboard a vessel of mine. And he
      called the old man a &lsquo;caitiff hound&rsquo;? Awful thing to call a feller, that
      is. I&rsquo;ll bet that skipper felt ashamed. Looks like a good book. I&rsquo;ll
      borrow it to-night to read while you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; your lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any lessons to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t you? I thought that was a &lsquo;rithmetic over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know &lsquo;em now. Besides, you ain&rsquo;t got any right to order me
      around. You ain&rsquo;t my uncle. Can&rsquo;t I read that book, Uncle Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Perez! He hesitated, swallowed once or twice, and answered, &ldquo;You can
      read it after you&rsquo;ve studied a spell. You&rsquo;ll let him have it then, won&rsquo;t
      you, Eri? Now study, like a good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri looked as if he would like to say something further, but he
      evidently thought better of it, and tossed the paper novel across to
      Captain Perez, who put it on the table, saying, rather feebly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, it&rsquo;s right there, where you can have it soon&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve l&rsquo;arned
      your examples. Now pitch in, so&rsquo;s the teacher can see how smart you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His nephew grumblingly got his paper and pencil, took the arithmetic and
      went to work. No one spoke for a while, Captain Perez twirling his thumbs
      and looking, as he felt, uncomfortable. Soon Josiah, announcing that his
      studies were completed, grabbed the novel from the table, took a lamp from
      the kitchen and went off to bed. When he had gone Captain Jerry said,
      &ldquo;Perez, you&rsquo;re sp&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; that boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I am, I s&rsquo;pose I am, but I can&rsquo;t bear to be cross to him,
      somehow. Poor Lizzie, she made me promise I wouldn&rsquo;t be, and I jest can&rsquo;t;
      that&rsquo;s all. You understand how &lsquo;tis, don&rsquo;t you, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain nodded. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I said anything. I
      hadn&rsquo;t ought to be givin&rsquo; orders &lsquo;bout what&rsquo;s none of my affairs. What
      time is it gittin&rsquo; to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry announced that it was bedtime, and that he was going to turn
      in. Perez, still looking worried and anxious, said that he also was going
      to bed. Captain Eri thought that he would sit up for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour and still another went by, and the Captain sat there in his
      rocker. His two friends were sound asleep. Mrs. Snow called twice from the
      head of the stairs to know if Elsie had come back, and where on earth she
      could be. Captain Eri&rsquo;s answers were cheery and to the effect that the
      young lady had an errand up town, and would be home pretty soon, he
      guessed. Nevertheless, it might have been noticed that he glanced at the
      clock every few minutes, and grew more and more fidgety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after eleven when Elsie came in. She hurriedly and with some
      confusion apologized for being so late, and thanked the Captain for
      sitting up for her. She made no offer to explain her long absence and, as
      she went upstairs, Captain Eri noticed that her face was, if anything,
      paler than when she went out, and her eyes looked as if she had been
      crying. He wanted to ask her some questions, but didn&rsquo;t, because she
      evidently did not wish to talk. He pondered over the matter while
      undressing, and for a long time after that lay awake thinking. That the
      girl was in trouble of some sort was plain, but he could not understand
      why she said nothing about it, or what its cause might be. She had been
      her bright, happy self all day and a part of the evening. Then she had
      suddenly changed. The Captain wondered what was in that letter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A LITTLE POLITICS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Elsie, when she came down to breakfast next morning, was quieter than
      usual, and to the joking questions of Captain Jerry and Captain Perez, who
      were curious concerning her &ldquo;errand&rdquo; of the previous evening, and who
      pretended to believe that she had gone to a dance or &ldquo;time&rdquo; with some
      &ldquo;feller&rdquo; unknown, she gave evasive, but good-humored replies. Captain Eri
      was on his usual fishing trip, and after breakfast was over Perez departed
      to the Barry place, and Jerry to his beloved schoolhouse. The sacrifice,
      whose impending matrimonial doom had not been mentioned for some time by
      the trio interested, was gradually becoming his own garrulous self, and
      his principal topic of conversation recently had been the coming marriage
      of the &ldquo;upstairs teacher&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the lady who presided over the
      grammar grade of the school&mdash;and the question of her probable
      successor. In fact, this question of who the new teacher was to be was the
      prevailing subject of surmise and conjecture in the village just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Jerry came back to the house he went out to the barn to feed
      Lorenzo and the hens, and attend to Daniel&rsquo;s toilet. He was busy with the
      curry-comb when Elsie came in. She seated herself on a box, and watched
      the performance for a while without speaking. The Captain, who took this
      part of his duties very seriously, was too intent on crimping Daniel&rsquo;s
      rather scraggy forelock to talk much. At length Miss Preston broke the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jerry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have never told me just where you found
      grandfather that night when he was taken sick. On the hill back of the
      post-office, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, jest on the top. You see, he&rsquo;d fell down when he was runnin&rsquo; to the
      fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Eri found him, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. Whoa there, Dan&rsquo;l; stand still, can&rsquo;t you? Yes, Eri found him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he dressed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? John? Oh, he was bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves, jest as he run
      outdoors when he heard the bell. Queer, he didn&rsquo;t put on that old white
      hat of his. I never knew him to be without it afore; but a feller&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble
      to forgit &lsquo;most anything a night like that was. Did Eri tell you how Perez
      forgot his shoes? Funniest thing I ever see, that was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began the story of his friend&rsquo;s absent-mindedness, but his companion
      did not seem to pay much attention to it. In fact, it was evident that her
      thoughts were somewhere else, for when the Captain asked her a question
      that plainly called for a negative, she replied &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; very calmly, and
      didn&rsquo;t seem to know that she had said it. She went into the house soon
      after and Captain Jerry, after considering the matter, decided that she
      was probably thinking of Hazeltine. He derived much comfort from the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he, too, entered the dining room, Elsie said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Captain Jerry! Please don&rsquo;t tell the others that I asked about
      grandfather. They would think that I was worrying, and I&rsquo;m not, a bit. You
      won&rsquo;t mention it, will you? Just promise, to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Captain promised, although he did not understand why it was asked
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Eri came home that afternoon, and was cleaning his catch at
      the shanty, he was surprised to receive a call from Miss Preston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Come to l&rsquo;arn the trade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie smiled, and disclaimed any intention of apprenticeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Eri,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you, a business
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked at her keenly. All he said, however, was, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want to talk with you about getting me a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a great deal lately, and, now that grandfather
      seems to be a little better, and I&rsquo;m not needed to help take care of him,
      I want to do something to earn my living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earn your livin&rsquo;? Why, child alive, you don&rsquo;t need to do that. You ain&rsquo;t
      a mite of trouble at the house; fact is, I don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;d get along
      without you, and, as for money, why I cal&rsquo;late your grandpa ain&rsquo;t so poor
      but what, if I let you have a little change once in a while, he&rsquo;d be able
      to pay me back, when he got better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to use your money or his either. Captain Eri, you don&rsquo;t
      know what he has done for me ever since I was a little girl. He has
      clothed me and given me an education, and been so kind and good that, now
      that he is ill and helpless, I simply can&rsquo;t go on using his money. I
      can&rsquo;t, and I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears stood in the girl&rsquo;s eyes, as she spoke, and the Captain,
      noticing her emotion, thought it better to treat the matter seriously, for
      the present at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Independence shows a proper sperit and saves
      grocery bills,&rsquo; as old man Scudder said when his wife run off with the
      tin-peddler. What kind of a place was you thinkin&rsquo; of takin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to get the appointment to teach in the grammar school here. Miss
      Nixon is going to be married, and when she leaves I want her place&mdash;and
      I want you to help me get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri whistled. &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Then he said, &ldquo;Look
      here, Elsie, I don&rsquo;t want you to think I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to be cur&rsquo;ous &lsquo;bout your
      affairs, or anything like that, but are you sure there ain&rsquo;t some reason
      more &lsquo;n you&rsquo;ve told me of for your wantin&rsquo; this place? I ain&rsquo;t no real
      relation of yours, you understand, but I would like to have you feel that
      you could come to me with your troubles jest the same as you would to your
      grandpa. Now, honest and true, ain&rsquo;t there somethin&rsquo; back of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only for a moment that Elsie hesitated, but that moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation and the manner in which she answered went far toward confirming
      the Captain&rsquo;s suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Captain Eri,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is just as I&rsquo;ve told you. I don&rsquo;t want to
      be dependent on grandfather any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there ain&rsquo;t a single other reason for&mdash;Of course, I ought to
      mind my business, but&mdash;Well, there! what was it you wanted me to do?
      Help you git the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you will. I know Captain Perez has said that you were interested
      in the town-meetings and helped to nominate some of the selectmen and the
      school-committee, so I thought perhaps, if you used your influence, you
      might get the position for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I did do a little electioneerin&rsquo; for one or two
      fellers and maybe they&rsquo;d ought to be willin&rsquo; to do somethin&rsquo; for me.
      Still, you can&rsquo;t never tell. A cat &lsquo;ll jump over your hands if she knows
      there&rsquo;s a piece of fish comin&rsquo; afterwards, but when she&rsquo;s swallowed that
      fish, it&rsquo;s a diff&rsquo;rent job altogether. Same way with a politician. But,
      then, you let me think over it for a spell, and p&rsquo;raps to-morrow we&rsquo;ll
      see. You think it over, too. Maybe you&rsquo;ll change your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t change my mind. I&rsquo;m ever and ever so much obliged to you,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started toward the door, but turned impulsively and said, &ldquo;Oh, Captain
      Eri, you don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m ungrateful, do you? You nor Captain Perez
      nor Captain Jerry won&rsquo;t think that I do not appreciate all your kindness?
      You won&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;m shirking my duty, or that I don&rsquo;t want to help
      take care of grandfather any longer? You won&rsquo;t? Promise me you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She choked down a sob as she asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri was as much moved as she was. He hastened to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Course we won&rsquo;t do no such thing. Run right
      along, and don&rsquo;t think another word about it. Wait till to-morrer. I&rsquo;ll
      have a plan fixed up to land that school-committee, see if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all that evening he worked at the model of the clipper, and the
      expression on his face as he whittled showed that he was puzzled, and not
      a little troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back from his fishing next day a little earlier than usual,
      changed his working-clothes for his second best suit, harnessed Daniel
      into the buggy, and then came into the house, and announced that he was
      going over to the Neck on an errand, and if Elsie wanted to go with him,
      he should be glad of her company. As this was but part of a pre-arranged
      scheme, the young lady declared that a ride was just what she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri said but little, as they drove up to the &ldquo;main road&rdquo;; he
      seemed to be thinking. Elsie, too, was very quiet. When they reached the
      fruit and candy shop, just around the corner, the Captain stopped the
      horse, got down, and went in. When he came out he had a handful of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Captain Eri,&rdquo; said Elsie, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you smoked cigars. I
      thought a pipe was your favorite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gin&rsquo;rally speakin&rsquo;, &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m electioneerin&rsquo; 
      now, and politics without cigars would be like a chowder without any
      clams. Rum goes with some kind of politics, but terbacker kind of chums in
      with all kinds. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t always safe to jedge a candidate by the kind of
      cigars he gives out neither; I&rsquo;ve found that out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reminds me of a funny thing that Obed Nickerson told me one time. Obed
      used to be in politics a good deal up and down the Cape, here, and he had
      consider&rsquo;ble influence. &lsquo;Twas when Bradley up to Fall River was runnin&rsquo; 
      for Congress. They had a kind of pow-wow in his office&mdash;a whole gang
      of district leaders&mdash;and Obed he was one of &lsquo;em. Bradley went to git
      out the cigar-box, and &lsquo;twas empty, so he called in the boy that swept out
      and run errands for him, give the youngster a ten-dollar bill, and told
      him to go down to a terbacker store handy and buy another box. Well, the
      boy, he was a new one that Bradley&rsquo;d jest hired, seemed kind of surprised
      to think of anybody&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; so reckless as to buy a whole box of cigars at
      once, but he went and pretty soon come back with the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man told him to open it and pass &lsquo;em round. Well, everybody was
      lookin&rsquo; for&rsquo;ard to a treat, &lsquo;cause Bradley had the name of smokin&rsquo; better
      stuff than the average; but when they lit up and got a-goin&rsquo;, Obed said
      you could see that the gang was s&rsquo;prised and some disgusted. The old man
      didn&rsquo;t take one at fust, but everybody else puffed away, and the smoke and
      smell got thicker &lsquo;n&rsquo; thicker. Obed said it reminded him of a stable afire
      more &lsquo;n anything else. Pretty soon Bradley bit the end of one of the
      things and touched a match to it. He puffed twice&mdash;Obed swears
      &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n that&mdash;and then he yelled for the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;where&rsquo;d you git them cigars?&rsquo; Well, it
      come out that the boy hadn&rsquo;t told who the cigars was for, and he&rsquo;d bought
      a box of the kind his brother that worked in the cotton mill smoked. Obed
      said you&rsquo;d ought to have seen Bradley&rsquo;s face when the youngster handed him
      back seven dollars and seventy-five cents change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached that part of Orham which is called the Neck, and pulled up
      before a small building bearing the sign &ldquo;Solomon Bangs, Attorney-at-Law,
      Real Estate and Insurance.&rdquo; Here the Captain turned to his companion and
      asked, &ldquo;Sure you haven&rsquo;t changed your mind, Elsie? You want that
      school-teachin&rsquo; job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t changed my mind, Captain Eri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wanted to be sure. I should hate to ask Sol Bangs for anything
      and then have to back out afterwards. Come on, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Soloman Bangs was the chairman of the Orham school-committee. He was a
      short, stout man with sandy side-whiskers and a bald head. He received
      them with becoming condescension, and asked if they wouldn&rsquo;t sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve got a little bus&rsquo;ness I want to talk with you &lsquo;bout, Sol,&rdquo; said
      the Captain. &ldquo;Elsie, you set down here, and make yourself comf&rsquo;table, and
      Sol and me &lsquo;ll go inside for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he led the way into the little private office at the back of the
      building, and seemed to take it for granted that Mr. Bangs would follow,
      the latter gentleman couldn&rsquo;t well refuse. The private office was usually
      reserved for interviews with widows whose homestead mortgages were to be
      foreclosed, guileless individuals who had indorsed notes for friends, or
      others whose business was unpleasant and likely to be accompanied with
      weeping or profanity. Mr. Bangs didn&rsquo;t object to foreclosing a mortgage,
      but he disliked to have a prospective customer hear the dialogue that
      preceded the operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion the door of the sanctum was left ajar so that Elsie,
      although she did not try to listen, could not very well help hearing what
      was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the Captain commenting on the late cranberry crop, the
      exceptionally pleasant weather of the past month, and other irrelevant
      subjects. Then the perfumes of the campaign cigars floated out through the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;when&rsquo;s town meetin&rsquo; day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First Tuesday in December,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so &lsquo;tis, so &lsquo;tis. Gittin&rsquo; pretty nigh, ain&rsquo;t it? What are you goin&rsquo; 
      to git off the school-committee for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Get off the committee? Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. You are, ain&rsquo;t you? Seems to me I heard Seth Wingate
      was goin&rsquo; to run and he&rsquo;s from your district, so I thought, of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Seth going to try for the committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seth&rsquo;s a good man,&rdquo; was the equivocal answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good man! He ain&rsquo;t any better man than I am. What&rsquo;s he know about
      schools, or how to run &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s pretty popular. Folks like him. See here, Sol; what&rsquo;s this
      &lsquo;bout your turnin&rsquo; Betsy Godfrey off her place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I turned her off? I&rsquo;ve been carrying that mortgage for so long
      it&rsquo;s gray-headed. I can&rsquo;t be Santa Claus for the whole town. Business is
      business, and I&rsquo;ve got to look out for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, I s&rsquo;pose that&rsquo;s so. Still, folks talk, and Seth&rsquo;s got lots of
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri, I ain&rsquo;t denying that you could do a heap to hurt me if you wanted
      to, but I don&rsquo;t know why you should. I&rsquo;ve always been square with you,
      far&rsquo;s I know. What have you got against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nuthin&rsquo;, nuthin&rsquo;! Didn&rsquo;t I hear you was tryin&rsquo; to get that Harniss
      teacher to come down here and take Carrie Nixon&rsquo;s place when she got
      married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought of her. She&rsquo;s all night, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose she is. &lsquo;Twould be better if she lived in Orham, maybe, and
      folks couldn&rsquo;t say you went out of town for a teacher when you could have
      had one right from home. Then, she&rsquo;s some relation of your cousin, ain&rsquo;t
      she? &lsquo;Course, that&rsquo;s all right, but&mdash;well, you can&rsquo;t pay attention to
      everything that&rsquo;s said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could have got one right from home! Who&rsquo;d we get? Dave Eldredge&rsquo;s girl, I
      suppose. I heard she was after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation that followed was in a lower tone, and Elsie heard but
      little of it. She heard enough, however, to infer that Captain Eri was
      still the disinterested friend, and that Solomon was very anxious to
      retain that friendship. After a while the striking of matches indicated
      that fresh cigars were being lighted, and then the pair rose from their
      chairs, and entered the outer office. Mr. Bangs was very gracious,
      exceedingly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Preston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge tells me that it&mdash;er&mdash;might
      be possible for us&mdash;er&mdash;for the town to secure&mdash;er&mdash;to&mdash;in
      short, for us to have you for our teacher in the upstairs room. It ain&rsquo;t
      necessary for me to say that&mdash;er&mdash;a teacher from Radcliffe don&rsquo;t
      come our way very often, and that we&mdash;that is, the town of Orham,
      would&mdash;er&mdash;feel itself lucky if you&rsquo;d be willing to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I told him, Elsie,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t think
      of comin&rsquo; for forty-five dollars a month or anything like that. Of course,
      &lsquo;tisn&rsquo;t as though you really needed the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, I understand,&rdquo; said the pompous committeeman. &ldquo;I think that
      can be arranged. I really think&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Preston, that there
      ain&rsquo;t any reason why you can&rsquo;t consider it settled. Ahem!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie thanked him, trying her best not to smile, and they were bowed out
      by the great man, who, however, called the Captain to one side, and
      whispered eagerly to him for a moment or two. The word &ldquo;Seth&rdquo; was
      mentioned at least once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Captain Eri!&rdquo; exclaimed Elsie, as they drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grinned. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know I was such a heeler, did you?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you. If you&rsquo;re fishin&rsquo; for eels there ain&rsquo;t no use usin&rsquo; a
      mack&rsquo;rel jig. Sol, he&rsquo;s a little mite eely, and you&rsquo;ve got to use the kind
      of bait that &lsquo;ll fetch that sort of critter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t think he would care whether he was on the
      school-committee or not. It isn&rsquo;t such an exalted position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri&rsquo;s answer was in the form of a parable. &ldquo;Old Laban Simpkins
      that lived &lsquo;round here one time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was a mighty hard ticket.
      Drank rum by the hogshead, pounded his wife till she left him, and was a
      tough nut gin&rsquo;rally. Well, one evenin&rsquo; Labe was comin&rsquo; home pretty
      how-come-you-so, and he fell into Jonadab Wixon&rsquo;s well. Wonder he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      killed, but he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, and they fished him out in a little while. He said
      that was the deepest well he ever saw; said he begun to think it reached
      clear through to the hereafter, and when he struck the water he was
      s&rsquo;prised to find it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hot. He j&rsquo;ined the church the next week, and
      somebody asked him if he thought religion would keep him from fallin&rsquo; into
      any more wells. He said no; said he was lookin&rsquo; out for somethin&rsquo; further
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the way &lsquo;tis with Sol. School-committee&rsquo;s all right, but
      this section of the Cape nominates a State representative next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t forgit to see Seth,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I promised I would, and
      besides,&rdquo; with a wink, &ldquo;I think &lsquo;twould be better to do it &lsquo;cause, between
      you and me, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve Seth knows that he&rsquo;s been thinkin&rsquo; of runnin&rsquo; 
      for the committee and has decided not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second member of the school board, John Mullett, was, so the Captain
      said, a sort of &ldquo;me too&rdquo; to Mr. Bangs, and would vote as his friend
      directed. The third member was Mr. Langworthy, the Baptist minister and,
      although two to one was a clear majority, Captain Eri asserted that there
      was nothing like a unanimous vote, and so they decided to call upon the
      reverend gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found him at home, and Elsie was surprised, after the previous
      interview, to see how differently her champion handled the case. There was
      no preliminary parley and no beating about the bush. Miss Preston&rsquo;s claim
      to the soon-to-be-vacant position was stated clearly and with vigor. Also
      the reasons why she should receive a higher salary than had previously
      been paid were set forth. It was something of a surprise to Elsie, as it
      had been to Ralph, to see how highly the towns-people, that is, the
      respectable portion of them, seemed to value the opinions of this
      good-natured but uneducated seaman. And yet when she considered that she,
      too, went to him for advice that she would not have asked of other and far
      more learned acquaintances, it did not seem so surprising after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman had had several candidates in mind, but he was easily won
      over to Elsie&rsquo;s side, partly by the Captain&rsquo;s argument, and partly because
      he was favorably impressed by the young lady&rsquo;s appearance and manner. He
      expressed himself as being convinced that she would be exactly the sort of
      teacher that the school required and pledged his vote unconditionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, as Captain Eri said, the stump-speaking being over, there was
      nothing to do but to wait for the election, and Elsie and he agreed to
      keep the affair a secret until she received formal notice of the
      appointment. This was undoubtedly a good plan, but, unfortunately for its
      success, Solomon Bangs called upon his fellow in the committee, Mr.
      Mullett, to inform the latter that he, entirely unaided, had discovered
      the very teacher that Orham needed in the person of John Baxter&rsquo;s
      granddaughter. Mr. Mullett, living up to his &ldquo;me too&rdquo; reputation, indorsed
      the selection with enthusiasm, and not only did that, but also told
      everyone he met, so that Captain Perez heard of it at the post-office the
      very next afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural surprise of this gentleman and of Captain Jerry at their
      guest&rsquo;s sudden determination was met by plausible explanations from
      Captain Eri, to the effect that Elsie was a smart girl, and didn&rsquo;t like to
      be &ldquo;hangin&rsquo; &lsquo;round doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;, now that her grandpa was some better.&rdquo;
       Elsie&rsquo;s own reason, as expressed to them, being just this, the pair
      accepted it without further questioning. Neither of them attached much
      importance to the letter which she had received, although Captain Perez
      did ask Mrs. Snow if she knew from whom it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady from Nantucket was not so easily satisfied. At her first
      opportunity she cornered Captain Eri, and they discussed the whole affair
      from beginning to end. There was nothing unusual in this proceeding, for
      discussions concerning household matters and questions of domestic policy
      were, between these two, getting to be more and more frequent. Mrs. Snow
      was now accepted by all as one of the family, and Captain Eri had come to
      hold a high opinion of her and her views. What he liked about her, he
      said, was her &ldquo;good old-fashioned common-sense,&rdquo; and, whereas he had
      formerly trusted to his own share of this virtue almost altogether, now he
      was glad to have hers to help out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage idea, that which had brought the housekeeper to Orham, was
      now seldom mentioned. In fact, Captain Eri had almost entirely ceased to
      ruffle Jerry&rsquo;s feelings with reference to it. Mrs. Snow, of course, said
      nothing about it. But, for that matter, she said very little about herself
      or her affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a curious fact that the lady from Nantucket had never referred,
      except in a casual way, to her past history. She had never told how she
      came to answer the advertisement in the Nuptial Chime, nor to explain how
      so matter-of-fact a person as she was had ever seen that famous sheet. As
      she said nothing concerning these things, no one felt at liberty to
      inquire, and, in the course of time, even Captain Perez&rsquo; lively curiosity
      had lapsed into a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow was certain that Elsie&rsquo;s reason for wishing to obtain the
      position of school-teacher was something more specific than the one
      advanced. She was also certain that the girl was troubled about something.
      The root of the matter, she believed, was contained in the mysterious
      letter. As Captain Eri was of precisely the same opinion, speculation
      between the two as to what that letter might have contained was as lively
      as it was unfruitful.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing was certain, Elsie was not as she had formerly been. She did her
      best to appear the same, but she was much more quiet, and had fits of
      absentmindedness that the Captain and the housekeeper noticed. She had no
      more evening &ldquo;errands,&rdquo; but she occasionally took long walks in the
      afternoons, and on these walks she evidently preferred to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Mr. Hazeltine noticed this change in her was a question. The
      Captain thought he did, but at any rate, his calls were none the less
      frequent, and he showed no marked objection when Captain Jerry, who now
      considered himself bound in honor to bring about the union he had so
      actively championed, brought to bear his artful schemes for leaving the
      young folks alone. These devices were so apparent that Elsie had more than
      once betrayed some symptoms of annoyance, all of which were lost on the
      zealous match-maker. Ralph, like the others, was much surprised at Miss
      Preston&rsquo;s application for employment, but, as it was manifestly none of
      his business, he, of course, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next committee meeting Elsie was unanimously chosen to fill Miss
      Nixon&rsquo;s shoes as trainer of the young idea at the grammar school, and, as
      Miss Nixon was very anxious to be rid of her responsibilities in order
      that she might become the carefree bride of a widower with two small
      children, the shoe-filling took place in a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her first day&rsquo;s labors Elsie returned calm and unruffled. She had met
      the usual small rebellion against a new teacher, and had conquered it. She
      said she believed she had a good class and she should get on with them
      very nicely. It should be mentioned in passing, however, that Josiah
      Bartlett, usually the ring-leader in all sorts of trouble, was a trifle
      upset because the new schoolmistress lived in the same house with him, and
      so had not yet decided just how far it was safe to go in trespassing
      against law and order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanksgiving day came, and the Captains entertained Miss Patience Davis
      and her brother and Ralph Hazeltine at dinner. That dinner was an event.
      Captain Eri and Mrs. Snow spent a full twenty minutes with the driver of
      the butcher&rsquo;s cart, giving him directions concerning the exact breed of
      turkey that was to be delivered, and apparently these orders were
      effectual, for Captain Luther, who was obliged to hurry back to the
      life-saving station as soon as dinner was over, said that he was so full
      of white meat and stuffing that he cal&rsquo;lated he should &ldquo;gobble&rdquo; all the
      way to the beach. His sister stayed until the next day, and this was very
      pleasing to all hands, particularly Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had games in the evening, and here the captains distinguished
      themselves. Seth Wingate and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Obed Nickerson
      came in, as did several other retired mariners and their better-halves.
      Obed brought his fiddle and sat in the corner and played the music for a
      Virginia reel, and Ralph laughed until he choked to see Captain Jerry&mdash;half
      of his shirt-collar torn loose from the button and flapping like a sail&mdash;convoy
      stout Mrs. Wingate from one end of the line to the other, throwing into
      the performance all the fancy &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; and &ldquo;double-shuffles&rdquo; he learned at
      the Thanksgiving balls of a good many years before. Captain Perez danced
      with Miss Patience, who assured him she had never had such a good time
      since she was born. The only scoffer was the bored Josiah, who, being a
      sophisticated New Yorker, sat in the best chair and gazed contemptuously
      upon the entire proceeding. He told &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders the next day that he
      never saw such a gang of &ldquo;crazy jays&rdquo; in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even John Baxter was better that day. He seemed a trifle more rational,
      and apparently understood when they told him that it was Thanksgiving.
      There would have been no cloud anywhere had not Mrs. Snow, entering her
      room after Elsie had gone to bed, found that young lady awake and crying
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she wouldn&rsquo;t tell what the trouble was,&rdquo; said the housekeeper to
      Captain Eri, the next day. &ldquo;Said it was nothin&rsquo;; she was kind of worried
      &lsquo;bout her grandpa. Now, you and me know it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t THAT. I wish to goodness
      we knew WHAT it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain scratched his nose with a perplexed air. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one feller
      I&rsquo;d like to have a talk with jest &lsquo;bout now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the one
      that invented that yarn &lsquo;bout a woman&rsquo;s not bein&rsquo; able to keep a secret.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      CAPTAIN JERRY MAKES A MESS OF IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was during the week that followed the holiday so gloriously celebrated
      that Captain Jerry made a mess of it, and all with the best intentions in
      the world. Elsie had had a hard day at the school, principally owing to
      the perversity of the irrepressible Josiah, whose love for deviltry was
      getting the better of his respect for the new teacher. The boy had
      discovered that Elsie never reported his bad conduct to Captain Perez,
      and, therefore, that the situation was not greatly different from what it
      had been during the reign of Miss Nixon.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular day he had been a little worse than usual, and, as
      uneasiness and mischief in a schoolroom are as catching as the chickenpox,
      Elsie came home tired and nervous. Captain Eri and Mrs. Snow were certain
      that this increasing nervousness on the part of their guest was not due to
      school troubles alone, but, at any rate, nervous she was, and particularly
      nervous, and, it must be confessed, somewhat inclined to be irritable,
      during the supper and afterward, on this ill-starred night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginning of the trouble was when Ralph Hazeltine called. Mrs. Snow
      was with her patient in the upper room, Captain Eri was out, and Captain
      Perez and Captain Jerry were with Elsie in the dining room. The
      electrician was made welcome by the trio&mdash;more especially by the
      captains, for Miss Preston was in no mood to be over-effusive&mdash;and a
      few minutes of general conversation followed. Then Captain Jerry, in
      accordance with his plan of campaign, laid down his newspaper, coughed
      emphatically to attract the attention of his partner, and said, &ldquo;Well, I
      guess I&rsquo;ll go out and look at the weather for a spell. Come on, Perez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Captain Jerry!&rdquo; exclaimed Elsie, &ldquo;you were out looking at the
      weather only ten minutes ago. I don&rsquo;t think it has changed much since
      then. Why don&rsquo;t you stay here and keep us company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t never tell about the weather &lsquo;long this coast. It&rsquo;s likely
      to change most any time. Besides,&rdquo; with a wink that expressed
      comprehension unlimited, &ldquo;I reckon you and Mr. Hazeltine don&rsquo;t care much
      &lsquo;bout the company of old fogies like me and Perez. Two&rsquo;s company and
      three&rsquo;s a crowd, you know. Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jerry, come back this minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain chuckled and shook out of the door, followed by the
      obedient Perez, who, having pledged fealty, stuck to his colors whatever
      might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time, Elsie would probably have appreciated and enjoyed the
      joke as much as anyone, but this evening it did not appeal to her in the
      least. Ralph put in a very uncomfortable half-hour, and then cut his visit
      short and departed. It was rather sharp and chilly outside, but the breeze
      felt like a breath from the tropics compared with the atmosphere of that
      dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It certainly was Captain Jerry&rsquo;s unlucky evening, for he left Perez
      chatting with a fisherman friend, who had left a favorite pipe in his
      shanty and had come down to get it, and entered the house alone. He had
      seen the electrician go, and was surprised at the brevity of his call, but
      he was as far from suspecting that he himself was the indirect cause of
      the said brevity as a mortal could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into the dining room, hung his cap on the back of a chair, and
      remarked cheerfully, &ldquo;Well, Elsie, what did you send your company home so
      quick for? Land sake! twelve o&rsquo;clock wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t none too late for me when I
      was young and goin&rsquo; round to see the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Preston did not smile. On the contrary, she frowned, and when she
      spoke the Captain had a vague feeling that someone had dropped an icicle
      inside his shirt collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jerry,&rdquo; said the young lady, &ldquo;I want to have a talk with you. Why
      do you think it necessary to get up and leave the room whenever Mr.
      Hazeltine calls? You do it every time, and to-night was no exception,
      except that by what you said you made me appear a little more ridiculous
      than usual. Now, why do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s jaw fell. He stared at his questioner to see if she was not
      joking, but, finding no encouragement of that kind, stammered, &ldquo;Why do I
      do it? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &lsquo;cause I thought you wanted me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> wanted you to! Why should you think that, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I thought you two would ruther be alone. I know, when
      I used to go to see my wife &lsquo;fore we was married, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, what has that got to do with Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s visits here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, nothin&rsquo;, I s&rsquo;pose, if you say so. I jest thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you to suppose that Mr. Hazeltine is calling on me more
      than any other person or persons in this house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was something of a poser, but the Captain did his best. He sat on the
      edge of a chair and rubbed his knee, and then blurted out, &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose
      I&mdash;that is, we thought he was, jest &lsquo;cause he nat&rsquo;rally would; that&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;bout all. If I&rsquo;d thought&mdash;why, see here, Elsie, don&rsquo;t YOU think he&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo; to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a return thrust that was hard to parry, but, although the young
      lady&rsquo;s color heightened just a bit, she answered without much hesitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I do. At any rate, I have given you no authority to act
      on any such assumption, and I DON&rsquo;T want you to put me again in the
      ridiculous position you did this evening, and as you have done so often
      before. Why, his visits might be perfect torture to me, and still I should
      have to endure them out of common politeness. I couldn&rsquo;t go away and leave
      him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry&rsquo;s face was a study of chagrin and troubled repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful sorry; I am so. If I&rsquo;d thought I was
      torturin&rsquo; of you, &lsquo;stead of makin&rsquo; it pleasant, I&rsquo;d never have done it,
      sure. I won&rsquo;t go out again; I won&rsquo;t, honest. I hope you won&rsquo;t lay it up
      against me. I meant well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, if Captain Perez had delayed his entrance to that dining room only
      two or three minutes longer, if he had not come in just in time to prevent
      Elsie&rsquo;s making the explanatory and soothing answer that was on her tongue,
      events would probably have been entirely different, and a good deal of
      trouble might have been saved. But in he came, as if some perverse imp had
      been waiting to give him the signal, and the interview between Captain
      Jerry and the young lady whom he had unwittingly offended broke off then
      and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie went upstairs feeling a little conscience-stricken, and with an
      uneasy idea that she had said more than she should have. Captain Perez
      took up the newspaper and sat down to read. As for Captain Jerry, he sat
      down, too, but merely to get his thoughts assorted into an arrangement
      less like a spilled box of jackstraws. The Captain&rsquo;s wonderful scheme,
      that he had boasted of and worked so hard for, had fallen to earth like an
      exploded airship, and when it hit it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first idea was to follow the usual procedure, and take the whole
      matter to Captain Eri for settlement, but the more he considered this plan
      the less he liked it. Captain Eri was an unmerciful tease, and he would be
      sure to &ldquo;rub it in,&rdquo; in a way the mere thought of which made his friend
      squirm. There wasn&rsquo;t much use in confiding to Captain Perez, either. He
      must keep the secret and pretend that everything was working smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his thoughts turned to Hazeltine, and when he considered the wrong he
      had done that young man, he squirmed again. There wasn&rsquo;t a doubt in his
      mind that Ralph felt exactly as Elsie did about his interference. Captain
      Jerry decided that he owed the electrician an apology, and determined to
      offer it at the first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the opportunity came the very next morning, for Mrs. Snow wanted some
      clams for dinner, and asked him to dig some for her. The best clams in the
      vicinity were those in the flat across the bay near the cable station, and
      the Captain took his bucket and hoe and rowed over there. As he was
      digging, Ralph came strolling down to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-morning&rdquo; was clear and hearty. Captain Jerry&rsquo;s was
      hesitating and formal. The talk that followed was rather one-sided.
      Finally, the Captain laid down his hoe, and came splashing over to where
      his friend was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; he said confusedly, &ldquo;I kind of feel as if I ought to beg
      your pardon. I&rsquo;m awful sorry I done what I did, but, as I said to Elsie, I
      meant well, and I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry? Sorry for what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for leavin&rsquo; you and her alone so when you come to the house. You
      see, I never thought but what you&rsquo;d both like it, and &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t till she
      raked me over the coals so for doin&rsquo; it that I realized how things was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raked you over the coals? I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to repeat the whole of the long and tangled conversation
      that ensued. The Captain tried to explain, tumbled down, metaphorically
      speaking, got up again, and started off on another tack. In his anxiety to
      make his position perfectly clear, he quoted from Elsie&rsquo;s remarks of the
      previous evening, and then, thinking perhaps he had gone too far, tried to
      smooth these over by more explanations. Repeating this process several
      times got him into such a snarl that he scarcely knew what he was saying.
      When the agony was over Ralph had received the impression that Miss
      Preston had said his visits were a perfect torture to her, that she
      objected to being left alone with him, that she held Captain Jerry
      responsible for these things, and that the latter was sorry for something
      or other, though what it was he, Ralph, didn&rsquo;t know or care particularly.
      To the Captain&rsquo;s continued apologies he muttered absently that it was &ldquo;all
      right,&rdquo; and walked slowly away with his hands in his pockets. Captain
      Jerry was relieved by this expression of forgiveness. He felt that the
      situation wasn&rsquo;t what he would like to have it, but, at any rate, he had
      done his duty. This was a great consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph didn&rsquo;t call that evening or the next. When he did drop in it was
      merely to inquire concerning John Baxter&rsquo;s progress, and to chat for a
      moment with the captains. His next visit was a week later, and was just as
      brief and formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Elsie noticed this sudden change she said nothing. There might have
      been some comment by the others, had not a new sensation so occupied their
      minds as to shut out everything else. This sensation was caused by Josiah
      Bartlett, who ran away one night, with his belongings tied up in a brown
      paper parcel, leaving a note saying that he had gone to enlist in the Navy
      and wasn&rsquo;t coming back any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lively times the next morning when the note was found. Captain
      Perez was for harnessing up immediately and starting off to find the lost
      one, hit or miss. Captain Eri soon showed him the folly of this proceeding
      and, instead, hurried to the railway station and sent a telegram
      describing the fugitive to the conductor of the Boston train. It caught
      the conductor at Sandwich, and the local constable at Buzzard&rsquo;s Bay caught
      the boy. Josiah was luxuriously puffing a five-cent cigar in the smoking
      car, and it was a crest-fallen and humiliated prodigal that, accompanied
      by the a fore-mentioned constable, returned to Orham that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stubbornness remained, and the next day Perez sought Captain Eri
      in a troubled frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; he said dejectedly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do with that
      boy. He&rsquo;s too many for ME, that boy is. Seems he&rsquo;s been plannin&rsquo; this
      runnin&rsquo; away bus&rsquo;ness for more &lsquo;n a month; been doin&rsquo; errands and odd jobs
      &lsquo;round town and savin&rsquo; up his money on purpose. Says he won&rsquo;t go back to
      school again, no matter what we do to him, and that he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to git into
      the Navy if it takes ten year. He says he&rsquo;ll run away again fust chance he
      gits, and he WILL, too. He&rsquo;s got the sperit of the Old Scratch in him, and
      I can&rsquo;t git it out. I&rsquo;m clean discouraged and wore out, and I know that
      he&rsquo;ll do somethin&rsquo; pretty soon that &lsquo;ll disgrace us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed his friend. &ldquo;Stuffy as all that, is he? You don&rsquo;t say!
      He ain&rsquo;t a bad boy, that is a REEL bad boy, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s jest it. He ain&rsquo;t reel bad&mdash;yit. But he will be if he
      ain&rsquo;t fetched up pretty sudden. &lsquo;Course, I know what he needs is to be
      made to mind fust, and then preached to afterwards. And I know that
      nat&rsquo;rally I&rsquo;m the one that ought to do it, but I jest can&rsquo;t&mdash;there!
      If I should start out to give him the dressin&rsquo; down he needs, I&rsquo;d be
      thinkin&rsquo; of his mother every minute, and how I promised to treat him
      gentle and not be cross to him. But SOMETHIN&rsquo;S got to be done, and if you
      can help me out any way I&rsquo;ll never forgit it, Eri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri scratched his chin. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted reflectively. &ldquo;He
      couldn&rsquo;t git into the Navy, he&rsquo;s too young. More likely to be a stowaway
      on a merchantman and then roustabout on a cattle boat, or some such thing.
      Even if he lied &lsquo;bout his age and did git to be a sort of a ship&rsquo;s boy on
      a sailin&rsquo; vessel, you and me know what that means nowadays. I presume
      likely &lsquo;twould end in his bein&rsquo; killed in some rumshop scrimmage later on.
      Let&mdash;me&mdash;see. Bound to be a sailor, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead sot on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More fool he. Comes from readin&rsquo; them ridic&rsquo;lous story books, I s&rsquo;pose.
      He ain&rsquo;t been on the water much sence he&rsquo;s been down here, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more &lsquo;n once or twice, except in a dory goin&rsquo; to the beach, or
      somethin&rsquo; like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, that&rsquo;s what I thought. Well, Perez, I&rsquo;ll tell you. The boy
      does need breakin&rsquo; in, that&rsquo;s a fact, and I think maybe I could do it. I
      could use a young feller on my boat; to go coddin&rsquo; with me, I mean. Let me
      have the boy under me&mdash;no meddlin&rsquo; from anybody&mdash;for a couple of
      months. Let him sign reg&rsquo;lar articles and ship &lsquo;long of me for that time.
      Maybe I could make a white man of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve he&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I could talk him into it. There&rsquo;s some butter on my tongue
      when it&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to promise not to lay a hand on him in anger. That&rsquo;s what I
      promised his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I promise it now. That&rsquo;s all right, Perez. You and me are old
      shipmates, and bound to help each other out. Just trust him to me, and
      don&rsquo;t ask too many questions. Is it a trade? Good! Shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands on it, and then Captain Eri went in to talk to the
      unreconciled runaway. That young gentleman, fresh from his triumph over
      his uncle, at first refused to have anything to do with the scheme. He
      wasn&rsquo;t going to be a &ldquo;cheap guy fisherman,&rdquo; he was going into the Navy.
      The Captain did not attempt to urge him, neither did he preach or
      patronize. He simply leaned back in the rocker and began spinning sailor
      yarns. He told of all sorts of adventures in all climates, and with all
      sorts of people. He had seen everything under the sun, apparently, and,
      according to him, there was no life so free and void of all restraint as
      that of an able seaman on a merchant ship, or, preferably, on a fisherman;
      but one point he made clear, and that was that, unless the applicant had
      had previous training, his lot was likely to be an unhappy one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, as he rose to go, &ldquo;it was my idea to sort of train
      you up so&rsquo;s you could be ready when &lsquo;twas time to ship, but long&rsquo;s you
      don&rsquo;t want to, why it&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, Cap!&rdquo; said Josiah, whose eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s the talk! You might as well sign articles right away. Wait
      till I git &lsquo;em ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brought pen, ink, and paper, and proceeded to indite a formidable
      document to the effect that &ldquo;Josiah Bartlett, able seaman,&rdquo; was to ship
      aboard the catboat Mary Ellen for a term of two months. Wages, five
      dollars a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put you down as able seaman &lsquo;cause that&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ll be when I git through with you. Now sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Josiah signed, and then Captain Eri affixed his own signature with a
      flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain, bringing his big palm down on the back of
      the &ldquo;able seaman&rdquo; with a thump that brought water into the eyes of that
      proud youth, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my man, shipmate. We sail to-morrer mornin&rsquo; at four,
      rain or shine. I&rsquo;ll call you at quarter of. Be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet, old man!&rdquo; said Josiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez met his friend as they came out of the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Eri,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;be easy as you can with him, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain answered in the very words of his crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; he said fervently, and went away whistling. Captain Perez slept
      better that night.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE VOYAGE OF AN &ldquo;ABLE SEAMAN&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Promptly at a quarter to four the next morning Captain Eri rapped on the
      parlor door. Josiah, who had been dressed since three, appeared almost
      instantly. They walked down to the shore together, and the Captain&rsquo;s eyes
      twinkled as he noted the elaborate roll in the boy&rsquo;s walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mary Ellen was anchored between the beaches, and they rowed off to her
      in a dory. It was pitch-dark, and cold and raw. Lanterns showed on two or
      three of the other boats near by, and, as Josiah and the Captain pulled up
      the eelgrass-covered anchor, a dim shape glided past in the blackness. It
      was the You and I, bound out. Ira Sparrow was at the helm, and he hailed
      the Mary Ellen, saying something about the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It &lsquo;ll be kind of ca&rsquo;m for a spell,&rdquo; replied Captain Eri, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if we had some wind &lsquo;fore night. Here you, fo&rsquo;mast hand,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to Josiah, &ldquo;stand by to git the canvas on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mainsail was soon hoisted, and the catboat moved slowly out of the
      bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; exclaimed Josiah, &ldquo;what are you goin&rsquo; way off here for?
      Why don&rsquo;t you go straight out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gin&rsquo;rally take the short cut through the narrers,&rdquo; replied the Captain,
      &ldquo;but I thought you mightn&rsquo;t like the breakers on the shoals, so I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;round the p&rsquo;int flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! I ain&rsquo;t a-scared of breakers. Can&rsquo;t be too rough for me. Wisht
      &lsquo;twould blow to beat the band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe &lsquo;twill by and by. Pretty toler&rsquo;ble slick now, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after sunrise when they reached the ledge where codfish most do
      congregate. The land was a mere yellow streak on the horizon. The stiff
      easterly blow of the day before had left a smooth, heavy swell that,
      tripping over the submerged ledge, alternately tossed the Mary Ellen high
      in air and dropped her toward the bottom. It was cold, and the newly risen
      December sun did not seem to have much warmth in it. Anchor over the side,
      the Captain proposed breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;able seaman&rdquo; did not feel very hungry, but he managed to swallow a
      hard-boiled egg and a sandwich, and then, just to show that he had reached
      the dignity of manhood, leaned back against the side of the cockpit, lit a
      cigarette, and observed cheerfully, &ldquo;This is hot stuff, ain&rsquo;t it, Cap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri wiped the crumbs from his mouth, leisurely produced his pipe,
      and proceeded to fill it with tobacco shaved from a chunky plug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you smoke them things for?&rdquo; he asked contemptuously, referring to
      the cigarette. &ldquo;Nobody but dudes and sissies smoke that kind of truck.
      Here, take this pipe, and smoke like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josiah looked askance at the proffered pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said magnanimously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll want it yourself. I&rsquo;ll get along
      with these things till I git ashore; then I&rsquo;ll buy a pipe of my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind &lsquo;bout me. I&rsquo;ve got two or three more below there,
      some&rsquo;eres. Take it and light up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;able seaman&rdquo; took the reeking, nicotine soaked affair, placed it
      gingerly between his teeth, held a match to the bowl and coughingly
      emitted a cloud of ill-smelling smoke. The pipe wheezed and gurgled, and
      the Mary Ellen rocked and rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve sojered long enough. Go below, and
      bring up the bait bucket and the lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josiah staggered into the little cabin, reappeared with the heavy cod
      lines and the bucket of mussels, and watched while the Captain &ldquo;baited
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;Two lines apiece, one over each side.
      Watch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cod bit almost immediately, and for ten minutes the work was exciting
      and lively. The Captain, watching from the corner of his eye, noticed that
      his assistant&rsquo;s pipe was wheezing less regularly, and that his lines were
      thrown over more and more listlessly. At length he said, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t stopped
      smokin&rsquo; so quick, have you? What&rsquo;s the matter&mdash;gone out? Here&rsquo;s a
      match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed I&rsquo;ve smoked enough for now. I can&rsquo;t fish so well when I&rsquo;m
      smokin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh! If you want to be a reel sailor you must smoke all the time. Light
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly the boy obeyed, and puffed with feverish energy. Also he
      swallowed with vigor. The cod smelt fishy; so did the bait, and the
      catboat rolled and rolled. Suddenly Josiah pulled in his lines, and took
      the pipe from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired the watchful skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I won&rsquo;t fish any more, Cap. Kind of slow sport, ain&rsquo;t it?
      Guess I&rsquo;ll go in there and take a snooze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t! You shipped to fish, and you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to fish. Pick up
      them lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy sullenly turned toward the cabin door. Was he, who had just
      declared himself independent of school restraint, he who had once been the
      thorn in the flesh of every policeman in the &mdash;th ward, to be ordered
      about by this Cape Cod countryman! &ldquo;Aw, go chase yourself!&rdquo; he said
      contemptuously. A minute after, when he picked himself up from the heap of
      slimy fish in the bottom of the boat, he saw the Captain standing solidly
      on one cowhide-shod foot, while the other was drawn easily back and rested
      on its toe. When Josiah recovered his breath, the burst of bad language
      with which he assailed his companion did credit to his street bringing up.
      It was as short as it was fierce, however, and ended amid the cod and the
      mussels from the overturned bait bucket. But, as the Captain said
      afterwards, he was &ldquo;spunky&rdquo; and rose again, incoherent with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;You promised not to
      touch me, you lyin&rsquo; old&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to get out of the way, but didn&rsquo;t succeed, and this time merely
      sat up and sobbed as Captain Eri said in even tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not lyin&rsquo;. I promised not to lay a hand on you in anger, that&rsquo;s
      all. Fust place, I don&rsquo;t kick with my hands, and, second place, I ain&rsquo;t
      angry. Now, then, pick up them lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;able seaman&rdquo; was frightened. This sort of treatment was new to him.
      He judged it best to obey now and &ldquo;get square&rdquo; later on. He sulkily picked
      up the codlines, and threw the hooks overboard. Captain Eri, calmly
      resuming his fishing, went on to say, &ldquo;The fust thing a sailor has to
      l&rsquo;arn is to obey orders. I see you&rsquo;ve stopped smokin&rsquo;. Light up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want you TO. Light up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. Oh, yes, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He eyed the threatening boot fearfully and lit the awful pipe with shaking
      fingers. But he had taken but a few puffs when it went over the side, and
      it seemed to Josiah that the larger half of himself went with it. The
      Captain watched the paroxysm grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick, hey?&rdquo; he grunted, &ldquo;and not a capful of wind stirrin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re a
      healthy sailor! I thought I&rsquo;d shipped a man, but I see &lsquo;twas only a sassy
      baby. My uncle Labe had a good cure for seasickness. You take a big hunk
      of fat salt pork, dip it in molasses, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, d-o-n-&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Another spasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dip it in molasses,&rdquo; repeated Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Cap! PLEASE don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing a sailor learns is not to call his skipper &lsquo;Cap.&rsquo; A fo&rsquo;mast
      hand always says &lsquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rsquo; when his off&rsquo;cer speaks to him.
      Understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-e-s. Oh, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;I mean aye, aye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, SIR! OH, dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Now pick up them lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, &lsquo;twas a dreadful forenoon for Josiah; one not to be forgotten. The
      boat rolled unceasingly, his head ached, and pulling the heavy cod made
      his back and shoulders lame; also, he was wet and cold. The other boats
      scattered about the fishing grounds pulled up their anchors and started
      for home, but Captain Eri did not budge. At noon he opened his lunch
      basket again, and munched serenely. The sight of the greasy ham sandwiches
      was too much for the &ldquo;able seaman.&rdquo; He suffered a relapse and, when it was
      over, tumbled on the seat which encircled the cockpit and, being
      completely worn out, went fast asleep. The Captain watched him for a
      minute or two, smiled in a not unkindly way, and, going into the cabin,
      brought out an old pea jacket and some other wraps with which he covered
      the sleeper. Then he went back to his fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Josiah awoke the Mary Ellen was heeled over on her side, her sail as
      tight as a drumhead. The wind was whistling through the cordage, and the
      boat was racing through seas that were steel-blue and angry, with
      whitecaps on their crests. The sun was hidden by tumbling, dust-colored
      clouds. The boy felt weak and strangely humble; the dreadful nausea was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri, standing at the tiller, regarded him sternly, but there was
      the suspicion of a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feelin&rsquo; better?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;aye, aye, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Want to smoke again. Pipe right there on the thwart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before anything more was said. Josiah was gazing at the
      yellow sand-cliffs that, on every tack, grew nearer. At length the Captain
      again addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez ever tell you &lsquo;bout our fust v&rsquo;yage? Never did, hey? Well, I will.
      Him and me run away to sea together, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Captain Eri began a tale that caused the cold shivers to chase
      themselves from Josiah&rsquo;s big toe to the longest hair on his head. It was
      the story of two boys who ran away and shipped aboard an Australian
      sailing packet, and contained more first-class horrors than any one of his
      beloved dime novels. As a finishing touch the narrator turned back the
      grizzled hair on his forehead and showed a three-inch scar, souvenir of a
      first mate and a belaying pin. He rolled up his flannel shirtsleeve and
      displayed a slightly misshapen left arm, broken by a kick from a drunken
      captain and badly set by the same individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said in conclusion, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you think I was pretty hard on
      you this mornin&rsquo;, but what do you figger that you&rsquo;d have got if you talked
      to a mate the way you done to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;d have been killed,&mdash;sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you would, mighty nigh, and that&rsquo;s a fact. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you
      somethin&rsquo; else. You wanted to enlist in the Navy, I understand. You
      couldn&rsquo;t git in the Navy, anyway, you&rsquo;re too young, but s&rsquo;pose you could,
      what then? You&rsquo;d never git any higher &lsquo;n a petty officer, &lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t
      know enough. The only way to git into the Navy is to go through Annapolis,
      and git an education. I tell you, education counts. Me and Perez would
      have been somethin&rsquo; more &lsquo;n cheap fishin&rsquo; and coastin&rsquo; skippers if we&rsquo;d
      had an education; don&rsquo;t forgit that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t want to be a sailor, anyway, sir. This one trip is enough
      for me, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that. You shipped &lsquo;long with me for two months, and you&rsquo;ll
      sail with me for two months, every time I go out. You won&rsquo;t run away again
      neither, I&rsquo;ll look out for that. You&rsquo;ll sail with me and you&rsquo;ll help clean
      fish, and you&rsquo;ll mind me and you&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;sir.&rsquo; You needn&rsquo;t smoke if you
      don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; with a smile. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t p&rsquo;tic&rsquo;lar &lsquo;bout that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; went on the Captain, &ldquo;when the two months is up you&rsquo;ll be your own
      master again. You can go back to &lsquo;Web&rsquo; Saunders and &lsquo;Squealer&rsquo; Wixon and
      &lsquo;Ily&rsquo; Tucker and their tribe, if you want to, and be a town nuisance and a
      good-for-nuthin&rsquo;. OR you can do this: You can go to school for a few years
      more and behave yourself and then, if I&rsquo;ve got any influence with the
      Congressman from this district&mdash;and I sort of b&rsquo;lieve I have,
      second-handed, at any rate&mdash;you can go to Annapolis and learn to be a
      Navy officer. That&rsquo;s my offer. You&rsquo;ve got a couple of months to think it
      over in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The catboat swung about on her final tack and stood in for the narrows,
      the route which the Captain had spoken of as the &ldquo;short cut.&rdquo; From where
      Josiah sat the way seemed choked with lines of roaring, frothing breakers
      that nothing could approach and keep above water. But Captain Eri steered
      the Mary Ellen through them as easily as a New York cabdriver guides his
      vehicle through a jam on Broadway, picking out the smooth places and
      avoiding the rough ones until the last bar was crossed and the boat
      entered the sheltered waters of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; exclaimed the enthusiastic &ldquo;able seaman.&rdquo; &ldquo;That was great&mdash;er&mdash;sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of what I&rsquo;ll l&rsquo;arn you in the next two months,&rdquo; said the
      Captain. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do you any harm to know it when you&rsquo;re in the Navy
      neither. Stand by to let go anchor!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN JOHN BAXTER&rsquo;S ROOM
    </h3>
    <p>
      If Josiah expected any relaxation in Captain Eri&rsquo;s stern discipline he was
      disappointed, for he was held to the strict letter of the &ldquo;shipping
      articles.&rdquo; The Captain even went to the length of transferring Perez to
      the parlor cot and of compelling the boy to share his own room. This was,
      of course, a precaution against further attempts at running away. Morning
      after morning the pair rose before daylight and started for the fishing
      grounds. There were two or three outbreaks on the part of the &ldquo;able
      seaman,&rdquo; but they ended in but one way, complete submission. After a while
      Josiah, being by no means dull, came to realize that when he behaved like
      a man he was treated like one. He learned to steer the Mary Ellen, and to
      handle her in all weathers. Also, his respect for Captain Eri developed
      into a liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez was gratified and delighted at the change in his
      grandnephew&rsquo;s behavior and manners, and was not a little curious to learn
      the methods by which the result had been brought about. His hints being
      fruitless, he finally asked his friend point-blank. Captain Eri&rsquo;s answer
      was something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you remember old man Sanborn, that kept school here
      when you and me was boys? Well, when the old man run foul of a youngster
      that was sassy and uppish he knocked the sass out of him fust, and then
      talked to him like a Dutch uncle. He used to call that kind of treatment
      &lsquo;moral suasion.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; to Josiah; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;moral suasionin&rsquo; 
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez was a little anxious concerning the first part of this
      course of training, but its results were so satisfactory that he asked no
      more questions. The fact is, Captain Perez&rsquo; mind was too much occupied
      with another subject just at this time to allow him to be over-anxious.
      The other subject was Miss Patience Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Davis, her visit with her brother being over, was acting as companion
      to an old lady who lived in a little house up the shore, a mile or so
      above the station. This elderly female, whose name was Mayo, had a son who
      kept a grocery store in the village and was, therefore, obliged to be away
      all day and until late in the evening. Miss Patience found Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s
      crotchets a bit trying, but the work was easy and to her liking, and she
      was, as she said, &ldquo;right across the way, as you might say, from Luther.&rdquo;
       The &ldquo;way&rdquo; referred to was the stretch of water between the outer beach and
      the mainland.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Perez was much interested in Miss patience&mdash;very much so,
      indeed. His frequent visits to the Mayo homestead furnished no end of
      amusement to Captain Eri, and also to Captain Jerry, who found poking fun
      at his friend an agreeable change from the old programme of being the butt
      himself. He wasn&rsquo;t entirely free from this persecution, however, for Eri
      more than once asked him, in tones the sarcasm of which was elaborately
      veiled, if his match-making scheme had gotten tired and was sitting down
      to rest. To which the sacrifice would reply stoutly, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; out
      all right; you wait and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in his heart Captain Jerry knew better. He had been wise enough to say
      nothing to his friends concerning his interviews with Elsie and Ralph, but
      apparently the breaking-off between the pair was final. Hazeltine called
      occasionally, it is true, but his stays were short and, at the slightest
      inclination shown by the older people to leave the room, he left the
      house. There was some comment by Eri and Mrs. Snow on this sudden change,
      but they were far from suspecting the real reason. Elsie continued to be
      as reticent as she had been of late; her school work was easier now that
      Josiah was no longer a pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was rather a failure. There were presents, of course, but the
      planned festivities were omitted owing to a change in John Baxter&rsquo;s
      condition. From growing gradually better, he now grew slowly, but surely,
      worse. Dr. Palmer&rsquo;s calls were more frequent, and he did not conceal from
      Mrs. Snow or the captains his anxiety. They hid much of this from Elsie,
      but she, too, noticed the change, and was evidently worried by it. Strange
      to say, as his strength ebbed, the patient&rsquo;s mind grew clearer. His
      speech, that in his intervals of consciousness had heretofore dealt with
      events of the past, was now more concerned with recent happenings. But
      Captain Eri had never heard him mention the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in January Mrs. Snow and Captain Eri were together in the
      sick room. The rest of the household was absent on various errands;
      Captain Perez paying a visit to the life-saver&rsquo;s sister and Elsie staying
      after school to go over some examination papers. There was snow on the
      ground, and a &ldquo;Jinooary thaw&rdquo; was causing the eaves to drip, and the
      puddles in the road to grow larger. The door of the big stove was open,
      and the coals within showed red-hot. Captain Baxter was apparently asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow musingly, in a low tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here now,
      two, three, over four months. Seems longer, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems almost as if you&rsquo;d always been here,&rdquo; replied Captain Eri. &ldquo;Queer
      how soon we git used to a change. I don&rsquo;t know how we got along afore, but
      we did some way or other, if you call it gittin&rsquo; along,&rdquo; he added with a
      shrug. &ldquo;I should hate to have to try it over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always seemed funny to me,&rdquo; remarked the lady, &ldquo;that you men, all
      sailors so&mdash;and used to doin&rsquo; for yourselves, should have had such a
      time when you come to try keepin&rsquo; house. I should have expected it if you
      was&mdash;well, doctors, or somethin&rsquo; like that&mdash;used to havin&rsquo; folks
      wait on you, but all sea captains, it seems queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, don&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve thought of that myself. Anybody&rsquo;d think we was
      the most shif&rsquo;less lot that ever lived, but we wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. Even Jerry&mdash;and
      he&rsquo;s the wust one of the three when it comes to leavin&rsquo; things at loose
      ends&mdash;always had a mighty neat vessel, and had the name of makin&rsquo; his
      crews toe the mark. I honestly b&rsquo;lieve it come of us bein&rsquo; on shore and
      runnin&rsquo; the shebang on a share and share alike idee. If there&rsquo;d been a
      skipper, a feller to boss things, we&rsquo;d have done better, but when all
      hands was boss&mdash;nobody felt like doin&rsquo; anything. Then, too, we begun
      too old. A feller gits sort of sot in his ways, and it&rsquo;s hard to give in
      to the other chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, take that marryin&rsquo; idee,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I laughed at that a good deal
      at fust and didn&rsquo;t really take any stock in it, but I guess &lsquo;twas real
      hoss sense, after all. Anyhow, it brought you down here, and what we&rsquo;d
      done without you when John was took sick, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t
      said much about it, but I&rsquo;ve felt enough, and I know the other fellers
      feel the same way. You&rsquo;ve been so mighty good and put up with so many
      things that must have fretted you like the nation, and the way you&rsquo;ve
      managed&mdash;my!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole-souled admiration in the Captain&rsquo;s voice made the housekeeper
      blush like a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word, Cap&rsquo;n Eri,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been jest a pleasure
      to me, honest. I&rsquo;ve had more comfort and&mdash;well, peace, you might say,
      sence I&rsquo;ve been in this house than I&rsquo;ve had afore for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;of what we might have got for that
      advertisement, I swan it makes my hair curl. Advertisin&rsquo; that way in that
      kind of a paper, why we might have had a&mdash;a play actress, or I don&rsquo;t
      know what, landed on us. Seems &lsquo;s if there was a Providence in it: seems
      &lsquo;s if you was kind of SENT&mdash;there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you must think of me answerin&rsquo; an advertisement for a
      husband that way. It makes me &lsquo;shamed of myself when I think of it, I
      declare. And in that kind of a paper, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered more times than a few how you ever got a hold of that
      paper. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t one you&rsquo;d see every day nat&rsquo;rally, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow paused before she answered. Then she said slowly, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m
      s&rsquo;prised you ain&rsquo;t asked that afore. I haven&rsquo;t said much about myself
      sence I&rsquo;ve been here, for no p&rsquo;tic&rsquo;lar reason that I know of, except that
      there wasn&rsquo;t much to tell and it wasn&rsquo;t a very interestin&rsquo; yarn to other
      folks. My husband&rsquo;s name was Jubal Snow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;Why, Jerry used to know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Jubal knew a lot of folks on the Cape here. He was a
      good husband&mdash;no better anywheres&mdash;and he and I had a good life
      together long as he was well. I&rsquo;ve sailed a good many v&rsquo;yages with him,
      and I feel pretty nigh as much at home on the water as I do on land. Our
      trouble was the same that a good many folks have; we didn&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late that
      fair weather wouldn&rsquo;t last all the time, that&rsquo;s all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t his fault any more than &lsquo;twas mine. We saved a little money,
      but not enough, as it turned out. Well, he was took down sick and had to
      give up goin&rsquo; to sea, and we had a little place over in Nantucket, and
      settled down on it. Fust along, Jubal was able to do a little farmin&rsquo; and
      so on, and we got along pretty well, but by and by he got so he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      able to work, and then &lsquo;twas harder. What little we&rsquo;d saved went for
      doctor&rsquo;s bills and this, that, and t&rsquo;other. He didn&rsquo;t like to have me
      leave him, so I couldn&rsquo;t earn much of anything, and fin&rsquo;lly we come to
      where somethin&rsquo; had to be done right away, and we talked the thing over
      and decided to mortgage the house. The money we got on the mortgage lasted
      until he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a little life insurance, not enough, of course, but a little. He
      was plannin&rsquo; to take on more, but somehow it never seemed as if he could
      die, he so big and strong, and we put it off until he got so he couldn&rsquo;t
      pass the examination. When the insurance money come I took it to Jedge
      Briar, a mighty good friend of Jubal&rsquo;s and mine and the one that held the
      mortgage on the house, and I told him I wanted to pay off the mortgage
      with it, so&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d have the house free and clear. But the Jedge advised me
      not to, said the mortgage was costin&rsquo; me only six per cent., and why
      didn&rsquo;t I put the money where &lsquo;twas likely to be a good investment that
      would pay me eight or ten per cent.? Then I&rsquo;d be makin&rsquo; money, he said. I
      asked him to invest it for me, and he put it into the Bay Shore Land
      Company, where most of his own was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! I want to know!&rdquo; broke in the Captain. &ldquo;He did, hey! Well, I had
      some there, too, and so did Perez. Precious few fam&rsquo;lies on the Cape that
      didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he thought &lsquo;twas the safest and best place he knew of. The officers
      bein&rsquo; sons of Cape people and their fathers such fine men, everybody said
      &lsquo;twas all right. I got my dividends reg&rsquo;lar for a while, and I went out
      nussin&rsquo; and did sewin&rsquo; and got along reel well. I kept thinkin&rsquo; some day
      I&rsquo;d be able to pay off the mortgage and I put away what little I could
      towards it, but then <i>I</i> was took sick and that money went, and then
      the Land Company went up the spout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain nodded. The failure of the company had brought poverty to
      hundreds of widows. Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s case was but another instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;Where was I? Oh, yes! the Land Company&rsquo;s
      failin&rsquo;. Well, it failed and the insurance money went with it. It was
      discouragin&rsquo;, of course, but I had my house, except for the mortgage, and
      I had my health again, and, if I do say it, I ain&rsquo;t afraid of work, so I
      jest made up my mind there was no use cryin&rsquo; over spilt milk, and that I
      must git along and begin to save all over again. Then Jedge Briar died and
      his nephew up to Boston come into the property. I was behind in my
      payments a little, and they sent me word they should foreclose the
      mortgage, and they did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan! The mean sculpins! Didn&rsquo;t you have NOBODY you could go to;
      no relations nor nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a brother out in Chicago, but he married rich and his wife
      doesn&rsquo;t care much for her husband&rsquo;s relations. I never saw her but once,
      and then one of the first things she asked me was if it was true that
      there was more crazy people in Nantucket than in any other place of its
      size on earth, and afore I could answer she asked me what made &lsquo;em crazy.
      I told her I didn&rsquo;t know unless it was answerin&rsquo; city folks&rsquo; questions.
      She didn&rsquo;t like that very well, and I haven&rsquo;t heard from Job&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      my brother&mdash;for a long time. All my other near relations are dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they foreclosed the mortgage, and gave me notice to move out. I packed
      my things, and watered my flowers&mdash;I had quite a pretty flower garden&mdash;for
      the last time, and then come in and set down in the rocker to wait for the
      wagon that was goin&rsquo; to move me. I got to thinkin&rsquo; how proud Jubal and me
      was when we bought that house and how we planned about fixin&rsquo; it up, and
      how our baby that died was born in it, and how Jubal himself had died
      there, and told me that he was glad he was leavin&rsquo; me a home, at any rate;
      and I got so lonesome and discouraged that I jest cried, I couldn&rsquo;t help
      it. But I&rsquo;ve never found that cryin&rsquo; did much good, so I wiped my eyes and
      looked for somethin&rsquo; to read to take up my mind. And that Chime paper was
      what I took up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, there&rsquo;d been a big excursion from Boston down the day before,
      and some of the folks come down my way to have a sort of picnic. Two of
      &lsquo;em, factory girls from Brockton, they was, come to the house for a drink
      of water. They were gigglin&rsquo;, foolish enough critters, but I asked &lsquo;em in,
      and they eat their lunches on my table. They left two or three story
      papers and that Chime thing when they went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I looked it over, and almost the first thing I saw was that
      advertisement signed &lsquo;Skipper.&rsquo; It didn&rsquo;t read like the other trashy
      things in there, and it sounded honest. And all of a sudden it come over
      me that I&rsquo;d answer it. I was lonesome and tired and sort of didn&rsquo;t care,
      and I answered it right off without waitin&rsquo; another minute. That&rsquo;s all
      there is to tell. When I come here to be housekeeper I wrote the folks
      that&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; care of my furniture&mdash;they&rsquo;re reel kind people; I was
      goin&rsquo; to board there if I had stayed in Nantucket&mdash;to keep it till I
      come back. There! I meant to tell you this long ago, and I don&rsquo;t know why
      I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain knew why she hadn&rsquo;t. It was easy to read between the lines the
      tale of the years of disappointment and anxiety. Such stories are not easy
      to tell, and he respected the widow more than ever for the simple way in
      which she had told hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Land Company bus&rsquo;ness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;carried off a good lot of Cape Cod
      money. I never saw but one man that I thought was glad it busted, and that
      was old Caleb Weeks, over to Harniss. The old man was rich, but closer &lsquo;n
      the bark of a tree&mdash;he&rsquo;d skin a flea for the hide and taller&mdash;and
      used to be a hard case into the bargain. One time they had a big revival
      over there and he got religion. The boys used to say what caught Caleb was
      the minister&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; salvation was free. Well, anyhow, he got converted
      and j&rsquo;ined the church. That was all right, only while the fit was fresh he
      pledged himself to give five hundred dollars to help build the new chapel.
      When he cooled down a little he was sorry, and every time they&rsquo;d hint at
      his comin&rsquo; down with the cash, he&rsquo;d back and fill, and put it off for a
      spell. When the Land Company went up he was the only happy one in town,
      &lsquo;cause he said he&rsquo;d lost all his money. Course, under the circumstances,
      they couldn&rsquo;t ask him to pay, so he didn&rsquo;t. From what I hear he lost as
      much as fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed, and Mrs. Snow was about to answer when she was
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; said a weak voice. &ldquo;Eri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain started, turned sharply, and saw the sick man watching him,
      his eyes fixed and unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; said John Baxter again, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow hurried to her patient, but the latter impatiently bade her let
      him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want Eri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri stooped down beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, John?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri s&rsquo;pose God called you to break man&rsquo;s law and keep his, what would you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain glanced anxiously at the house-keeper. Then he said
      soothingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, John. Don&rsquo;t worry &lsquo;bout that. You and me settled
      that long ago. How are you feelin&rsquo; now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; with the monotonous persistence of those whose minds are
      wandering,&mdash;and then cleanly once more, &ldquo;Eri, I&rsquo;ve been called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ssh-h! That&rsquo;s all right, John; that&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t you want Mrs. Snow
      to fix your piller? P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d lay a little easier, then. Now, Mrs.
      Snow, if you&rsquo;ll jest turn it while I lift him. So; that&rsquo;s better now,
      ain&rsquo;t it, shipmate, hey?&rdquo; But the sick man muttered an unintelligible
      something, and relapsed once more into the half-doze, half-stupor that was
      his usual state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri sighed in relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was queer, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had two or three of those spells in the last day or two,&rdquo; was the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain wondered what his friend might have said during those
      &ldquo;spells,&rdquo; but he was afraid to inquire. Instead, he asked, &ldquo;What did the
      doctor say when he was here this mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; very hopeful. I asked him plain what he thought of the case, and
      he answered jest as plain. He said Cap&rsquo;n Baxter had failed dreadful in the
      last week, and that he wouldn&rsquo;t be s&rsquo;prised if he dropped off most any
      time. Then again, he said he might live for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a while, watching the sick man, whose sleep, or
      stupor, was not as tranquil as usual. Two or three times his eyes opened,
      and he muttered audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him so restless afore,&rdquo; commented Captain Eri anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was so last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Elsie see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was alone here, and she was asleep in the next room. I got up and
      shut the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain glanced keenly at the housekeeper, but her face was placid and
      inscrutable. He shifted uneasily and then said, &ldquo;Elsie&rsquo;s late to-night,
      ain&rsquo;t she? I wonder what&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;School work, I s&rsquo;pose. She&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; harder &lsquo;n she ought to, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FIRE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word was shouted, and the room rang with it. John Baxter, whose
      weakness had hitherto been so great that he could not turn himself in bed,
      was leaning on his elbow and pointing with outstretched finger to the open
      stove door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blazin&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s burnin&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s wipin&rsquo; the
      plague spot from the earth. I hear you, Lord! I&rsquo;m old, but I hear you, and
      your servant&rsquo;s ready. Where will it be to-morrer? Gone! burnt up! and the
      ways of the wicked shan&rsquo;t prevail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They forced him back on the pillow, but he fought them fiercely for a
      moment or two. After they thought they had quieted him, he broke out
      again, talking rapidly and clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear the call, Lord,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thank thee for showin&rsquo; it to me in
      your Book. &lsquo;And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
      their goodly castles, with fire.&rsquo; With fire! With fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ssh-h! There, there, John! Don&rsquo;t talk so,&rdquo; entreated the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the kerosene?&rdquo; continued the old man. &ldquo;And the matches? Now
      softly, softly. The shavin&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s dark. Here, in the corner. Ah, ha! ah,
      ha! &lsquo;And all their goodly castles with fire!&rsquo; Now, Web Saunders, you
      wicked man! Now! Burn! I&rsquo;ve done it, Lord! I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; almost shouted the agonized Captain Eri. &ldquo;Hush, John! Be still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Cap&rsquo;n Baxter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow soothingly, laying her hand
      on the sick man&rsquo;s forehead. Somehow, the touch seemed to quiet him; his
      eyes lost their fire, and he muttered absently that he was tired. Then the
      eyes closed and he lay still, breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land of love!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;That was awful! Hadn&rsquo;t I better go
      for the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, unless he gits worse. He had jest such a turn, as I
      told you, last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he talk like he did jest now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout the same things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain gasped. &ldquo;Then you knew!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he set the billiard room afire? Yes. I&rsquo;ve always rather suspicioned
      that he did, and last night, of course, made me sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! You haven&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it to anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, &lsquo;course you haven&rsquo;t. You must excuse me&mdash;I&rsquo;m kind of upset, I
      guess. Dear! dear! Did you think <i>I</i> knew it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sort of guessed that you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did. I&rsquo;ve known it ever sence that night he was found. He had his
      coat on when I found him, and &lsquo;twas all burnt, and there was an empty
      kerosene bottle in his pocket. I hid the coat, and threw the bottle away,
      and turned him so he was facin&rsquo; towards the saloon &lsquo;stead of from it. And
      I lied when I told the doctor that he was jest as he fell. There! the
      murder&rsquo;s out! Now, what do you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think? I think you did exactly right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sartinly do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I snum! I&rsquo;ve been over that thing time and time again, and I&rsquo;ve
      felt like I was sort of a firebug myself sometimes. I&rsquo;ve heard folks
      layin&rsquo; it to fust one and then the other, and cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; that Web did it
      himself to git the insurance, and all the time I&rsquo;ve known who really did
      do it, and haven&rsquo;t said anything. I jest couldn&rsquo;t. You see, John and me&rsquo;s
      been brothers almost. But I didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose anybody else would see it the
      same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Eri, do you s&rsquo;pose I blame you for tryin&rsquo; to keep your best friend
      out of trouble that he got into by bein&rsquo;&mdash;well&mdash;out of his head.
      Why, land of mercy! He ain&rsquo;t no more to be held responsible than a baby.
      You did what I&rsquo;d have done if I&rsquo;d been in your place, and I respect you
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s voice shook as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marthy Snow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the kind of woman that I&rsquo;d like to have
      had for a sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps a half-hour later when Captain Eri started for the
      schoolhouse to bring Elsie home. John Baxter had not wakened, and Mrs.
      Snow said she was not afraid to remain alone with him. The thaw had turned
      to a light rain and the Captain carried an umbrella. It was dark by this
      time, and when he came in sight of the schoolhouse he saw a light in the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the scholars&mdash;a by no means brilliant one&mdash;whose
      principal educational achievement was the frequency with which he
      succeeded in being &ldquo;kept after school,&rdquo; was seated on the fence, doing his
      best to whittle it to pieces with a new jackknife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, sonny!&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Miss Preston gone yit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the boy, continuing to whittle. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s up there.
      Mr. Saunders is there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saunders? WEB SAUNDERS?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. I see him go in there a little while ago.&rdquo; Captain Eri started
      toward the schoolhouse at a rapid pace; then he suddenly stopped; and
      then, as suddenly, walked on again. All at once he dropped his umbrella
      and struck one hand into the palm of the other with a smack.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the door, he leaned the umbrella in the corner and walked
      up the stairs very softly, indeed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A BUSINESS CALL
    </h3>
    <p>
      That enterprising business man, Mr. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders, opened the door of his
      renovated billiard room a little later than usual the next morning. It was
      common report about the village that Mr. Saunders occasionally sampled the
      contents of some of the &ldquo;original packages&rdquo; which, bearing the name and
      address of a Boston wholesale liquor dealer, came to him by express at
      irregular intervals. It was also reported, probably by unreliable total
      abstainers, that during these &ldquo;sampling&rdquo; seasons his temper was not of the
      best. Perhaps Mrs. Saunders might have said something concerning this
      report if she had been so disposed, but unless a discolored eye might be
      taken as evidence, she never offered any. The injury to her eye she
      explained by saying that something &ldquo;flew up and hit her.&rdquo; This was no
      doubt true.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, gossip aside, Mr. Saunders did not seem in good humor on this
      particular morning. A yellow cur, of nondescript breed, taken since the
      fire, in payment of a debt from &ldquo;Squealer&rdquo; Wixon, who had described it as
      a &ldquo;fust-class watchdog,&rdquo; rose from its bed behind the cigar counter,
      yawned, stretched, and came slinking over to greet its master. &ldquo;Web&rdquo;
       forcibly hoisted it out of the door on the toe of his boot. Its yelp of
      pained surprise seemed to afford the business man considerable relief, for
      he moved more briskly afterward, and proceeded to sweep the floor with
      some degree of speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forenoon trade at the billiard room was never very lively, and this
      forenoon was no exception. &ldquo;Bluey&rdquo; Batcheldor drifted in, stepped into the
      little room the door of which was lettered &ldquo;Ice Cream Parlor,&rdquo; and busied
      himself with a glass and bottle for a few moments. Then he helped himself
      to a cigar from the showcase, and told his friend to &ldquo;chalk it up.&rdquo; This
      Mr. Saunders didn&rsquo;t seem to care to do, and there was a lively argument.
      At length &ldquo;Bluey&rsquo;s&rdquo; promise to &ldquo;square up in a day or so&rdquo; was accepted,
      under protest, and the customer departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eleven the man of business was dozing in a chair by the
      stove, and the &ldquo;watchdog,&rdquo; having found it chilly outside and venturing
      in, was dozing near him. The bell attached to the door rang vigorously,
      and both dog and man awoke with a start. The visitor was Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Captain was perhaps the last person whom the proprietor of the
      billiard room expected to see, but a stranger never would have guessed it.
      In fact, the stranger might reasonably have supposed that the visitor was
      Mr. Saunders&rsquo; dearest friend, and that his call was a pleasure long looked
      forward to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; exclaimed &ldquo;Web,&rdquo; &ldquo;how are you? Put her there! I&rsquo;m glad to
      see you lookin&rsquo; so well. I said to &lsquo;Squealer&rsquo; the other day, s&rsquo;I,
      &lsquo;Squealer, I never see a man hold his age like Cap&rsquo;n Hedge. I&rsquo;ll be
      blessed if he looks a day over forty,&rsquo; I says. Take off your coat, won&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, the Captain must have lost sight of &ldquo;Web&rsquo;s&rdquo; extended
      hand. Certainly, the hand was large enough to be seen, but he did not take
      it. He did, however, accept the invitation to remove his coat, and,
      slipping out of the faded brown pea jacket, threw it on a settee at the
      side of the room. His face was stern and his manner quiet, and in spite Of
      Mr. Saunders&rsquo; flattering reference to his youthful appearance, this
      morning he looked at least more than a day past forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if Captain Eri was more than usually quiet and reserved, &ldquo;Web&rdquo; was
      unchanged, and, if he noticed that the handshake was declined, said
      nothing about it. His smile was sweetness itself, as he observed, &ldquo;Well,
      Cap&rsquo;n, mighty mod&rsquo;rate weather we&rsquo;re having for this time of year, ain&rsquo;t
      it? What&rsquo;s new down your way? That&rsquo;s right, have a chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain had no doubt anticipated this cordial invitation, for he
      seated himself before it was given, and, crossing his legs, extended his
      dripping rubber boots toward the fire. The rain was still falling, and it
      beat against the windows of the saloon in gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Web,&rdquo; said Captain Eri, &ldquo;set down a minute. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure!&rdquo; exclaimed the genial man of business, pulling up another
      chair. &ldquo;Have a cigar, won&rsquo;t you? You don&rsquo;t come to see me very often, and
      I feel&rsquo;s though we ought to celebrate. Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not, thank you,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll smoke my pipe, if it&rsquo;s
      all the same to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders didn&rsquo;t mind in the least, but thought he would have a cigar
      himself. So he lit one and smoked in silence as the Captain filled his
      pipe. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; knew that this was something more than an ordinary social
      visit. Captain Eri&rsquo;s calls at the billiard room were few and far between.
      The Captain, for his part, knew what his companion was thinking, and the
      pair watched each other through the smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pipe drew well, and the Captain sent a blue cloud whirling toward the
      ceiling. Then he asked suddenly, &ldquo;Web, how much money has Elsie Preston
      paid you altogether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders started the least bit, and his small eyes narrowed a trifle.
      But the innocent surprise in his reply was a treat to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie? Paid ME?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How much has she paid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do. She&rsquo;s been payin&rsquo; you money reg&rsquo;lar for more &lsquo;n a month. I
      want to know how much it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about. Nobody&rsquo;s paid
      me a cent except them that&rsquo;s owed me. Who did you say? Elsie Preston?
      That&rsquo;s the school-teacher, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Web, you&rsquo;re a liar, and always was, but you needn&rsquo;t lie to me this
      mornin&rsquo;, &lsquo;cause it won&rsquo;t be healthy; I don&rsquo;t feel like hearin&rsquo; it. You
      understand that, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders thought it time to bluster a little. He rose to his feet
      threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no man &lsquo;ll call me a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a precious few that calls you anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old man, or I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind how old I am. A minute ago you said I didn&rsquo;t look more &lsquo;n
      forty; maybe I don&rsquo;t feel any older, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that Preston girl has told you any&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t told me anything. She doesn&rsquo;t know that I know anything. But I
      do know. I was in the entry upstairs at the schoolhouse for about ten
      minutes last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders&rsquo; start was perceptible this time. He stood for a moment
      without speaking. Then he jerked the chair around, threw himself into it,
      and said cautiously, &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I come up from the house to git Elsie home &lsquo;cause &lsquo;twas rainin&rsquo;. I was
      told you was with her, and I thought there was somethin&rsquo; crooked goin&rsquo; on;
      fact is, I had a suspicion what &lsquo;twas. So when I got up to the door I
      didn&rsquo;t go in right away; I jest stood outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listenin&rsquo;, hey! Spyin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. I don&rsquo;t think much of folks that listens, gin&rsquo;rally speakin&rsquo;, but
      there&rsquo;s times when I b&rsquo;lieve in it. When I&rsquo;m foolin&rsquo; with a snake I&rsquo;d jest
      as soon hit him from behind as in front. I didn&rsquo;t hear much, but I heard
      enough to let me know that you&rsquo;d been takin&rsquo; money from that girl right
      along. And I think I know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Saunders asked the question that a bigger rascal than he had
      asked some years before. He leaned back in his chair, took a pull at his
      cigar, and said sneeringly, &ldquo;Well, what are you goin&rsquo; to do &lsquo;bout it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stop it, and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make you give the money back. How
      much has she paid you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of your d&mdash;n bus&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain rose to his feet. Mr. Saunders sprang up, also, and reached
      for the coal shovel, evidently expecting trouble. But if he feared a
      physical assault, his fear was groundless. Captain Eri merely took up his
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it ain&rsquo;t none of my bus&rsquo;ness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a s&rsquo;lectman nor
      sheriff. But there&rsquo;s such things in town, and p&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;ll be
      int&rsquo;rested. Seems to me that I&rsquo;ve heard that blackmailin&rsquo; has got folks
      into State&rsquo;s prison afore now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? Never heard that folks that set fire to other people&rsquo;s
      prop&rsquo;ty got there, did you? Yes, and folks that helps &lsquo;em gits there, too,
      sometimes. Who was it hid a coat a spell ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Captain Eri&rsquo;s turn to start. He hesitated a moment, tossed the pea
      jacket back on the settee and sat down once more. Mr. Saunders watched
      him, grinning triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A coat, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a coat. Maybe you know who hid it; I can guess, myself. That coat
      was burned some. How do you s&rsquo;pose it got burned? And say! who used to
      wear a big white hat round these diggin&rsquo;s? Ah, ha! Who did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about the Captain&rsquo;s start this time. He wheeled sharply
      in his chair, and looked at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You found that hat, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I done! And where do you think I found it? Why, right at the
      back of my shed where the fire started. And there&rsquo;d been a pile of
      shavin&rsquo;s there, too, and there&rsquo;d been kerosene on &lsquo;em. Who smashed the
      bottle over in the field, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri seemed to be thinking. &ldquo;Web&rdquo; evidently set his own
      interpretation on this silence, for he went on, raising his voice as he
      did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I was fool enough not to know who set that fire? I knew the
      night she burned, and when I met Dr. Palmer jest comin&rsquo; from your house,
      and he told me how old Baxter was took sick goin&rsquo; to the fire&mdash;oh,
      yes, GOIN&rsquo;&mdash;I went up on that hill right off, and I hunted and I
      found things, and what I found I kept. And what I found when I pulled that
      burned shed to pieces I kept, too. And I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em yit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, hey? Dear! dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I have! And somebody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to pay for &lsquo;em. Goin&rsquo; to pay, pay,
      PAY! Is that plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain made no answer. He thrust his hands into his pockets and
      looked at the stove dolefully, so it seemed to the man of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fust off I thought I&rsquo;d have the old cuss jailed,&rdquo; continued Mr. Saunders.
      &ldquo;Then, thinks I, &lsquo;No, that won&rsquo;t pay me for my buildin&rsquo; and my bus&rsquo;ness
      hurt and all that.&rsquo; So I waited for Baxter to git well, meanin&rsquo; to make
      him pay or go to the jug. But he stayed sick a-purpose, I b&rsquo;lieve, the
      mean, white-headed, psalm-singin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri moved uneasily and broke in, &ldquo;You got your insurance money,
      didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did, but whose fault is that? &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t his, nor any other darned
      &lsquo;Come-Outer&rsquo;s.&rsquo; It don&rsquo;t pay me for my trouble, nor it don&rsquo;t make me
      square with the gang. I gen&rsquo;rally git even sometime or &lsquo;nother, and I&rsquo;ll
      git square now. When that girl come here, swellin&rsquo; &lsquo;round and puttin&rsquo; on
      airs, I see my chance, and told her to pay up or her granddad would be
      shoved into Ostable jail. That give her the jumps, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote her a letter, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I did! She come &lsquo;round to see me in a hurry. Said she didn&rsquo;t have
      no money. I told her her granddad did, an she could git that or go to work
      and earn some. I guess she thought she&rsquo;d ruther work. Oh, I&rsquo;ve got her and
      her prayin&rsquo;, house-burnin&rsquo; granddad where I want &lsquo;em, and I&rsquo;ve got you,
      too, Eri Hedge, stickin&rsquo; your oar in. Talk to me &lsquo;bout blackmail! For two
      cents I&rsquo;d jail the old man and you, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the real Mr. Saunders. He usually kept this side of his nature
      for home use; his wife was well acquainted with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri was evidently frightened. His manner had become almost
      apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that if I was you, Web. I heard you tell
      Elsie last night she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t payin&rsquo; you enough, and I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you thought. You thought you could scare me. You didn&rsquo;t know
      I had the coat and hat, did you? Well, what I said I stand by. The girl
      AIN&rsquo;T payin&rsquo; me enough. Fourteen dollars a week she gits, and she&rsquo;s only
      been givin&rsquo; up ten. I want more. I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here Captain Eri interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that &lsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me what I wanted to
      know. Ten dollars a week sence the middle of November. &lsquo;Bout seventy
      dollars, rough figgerin&rsquo;. Now, then, hand it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand over that seventy dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand over hell! What are you talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain rose and, leaning over, shook his forefinger in Mr. Saunders&rsquo; 
      flabby red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You low-lived, thievin&rsquo; rascal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; you a chance you
      don&rsquo;t deserve. Either you&rsquo;ll pay me that money you&rsquo;ve stole from that girl
      or I&rsquo;ll walk out of that door, and when I come in again the sheriff &lsquo;ll be
      with me. Now, which &lsquo;ll it be? Think quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Web&rsquo;s triumphant expression was gone, and rage and malice had taken its
      place. He saw, now, that the Captain had tricked him into telling more
      than he ought. But he burst out again, tripping over words in his
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to think. Bring in your sheriff. I&rsquo;ll
      march down to your house and I&rsquo;ll show him the man that set fire to my
      buildin&rsquo;. What &lsquo;ll you and that snivelin&rsquo; granddaughter of his do then?
      You make off to think a turrible lot of the old prayer-machine &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s
      your chum. How&rsquo;d you like to see him took up for a firebug, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t? You AIN&rsquo;T! Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause he&rsquo;s gone where you can&rsquo;t git at him. He died jest afore I left
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saunders&rsquo; brandished fist fell heavily on the arm of his chair. His
      face turned white in patches, and then flamed red again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. John Baxter&rsquo;s dead. He was a chum of mine&mdash;you&rsquo;re right
      there&mdash;and if I&rsquo;d known a sneak like you was after him I&rsquo;d have been
      here long afore this. Why, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s voice shook, but he restrained himself and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you see where you stand, don&rsquo;t you? Long&rsquo;s John lived you had the
      proof to convict him; I&rsquo;ll own up to that much. I hid the coat; I smashed
      the bottle. The hat I didn&rsquo;t know &lsquo;bout. I might have told you at fust
      that all that didn&rsquo;t amount to anything, but I thought I&rsquo;d wait and let
      you tell me what more I wanted to know. John Baxter&rsquo;s gone, poor feller,
      and all your proof ain&rsquo;t worth a cent. Not one red cent. Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident that Mr. Saunders did understand, for his countenance
      showed it. But the bluster was not out of him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyhow, the girl&rsquo;s left, and if she don&rsquo;t pay I&rsquo;ll
      show her granddad up for what he was. And I&rsquo;ll show you up, too. Yes, I
      will!&rdquo; he shouted, as this possibility began to dawn on him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let
      folks know how you hid that coat and&mdash;and all the rest of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause you won&rsquo;t dare to. You&rsquo;ve been hittin&rsquo; at a sick man through a
      girl; neither of &lsquo;em could hit back. But now you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; bus&rsquo;ness with
      me, and I ain&rsquo;t sick. If you open your mouth to anybody,&mdash;if you let
      a soul know who set that fire,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll walk straight to Jedge Baker,
      and I&rsquo;ll tell him the whole story. I&rsquo;ll tell him what I did and why I did
      it. And THEN I&rsquo;ll tell him what you did&mdash;how you bullied money out of
      that girl that hadn&rsquo;t no more to do with the fire than a baby. If it comes
      to facin&rsquo; a jury I&rsquo;ll take my chances, but how &lsquo;bout you? You, runnin&rsquo; a
      town nuisance that the s&rsquo;lectmen are talkin&rsquo; of stoppin&rsquo; already; sellin&rsquo; 
      rum by the drink when your license says it shan&rsquo;t be sold &lsquo;cept by the
      bottle. Where&rsquo;ll YOUR character land you on a charge of blackmail?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing. The folks in this town knew John Baxter afore he was
      like what he&rsquo;s been lately. A good many of &lsquo;em swore by him&mdash;yes,
      sir, by mighty, some of &lsquo;em loved him! This is a law-abidin&rsquo; town, but
      s&rsquo;pose&mdash;jest s&rsquo;pose I should go to some of the fellers that used to
      sail with him, and tell &lsquo;em what you&rsquo;ve been up to. Think you&rsquo;d stay here
      long? <i>I</i> think you&rsquo;d move out&mdash;on a rail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri paused and sat on the arm of his chair, grimly watching his
      opponent, whose turn for thinking had come. The face of the billiard
      magnate was an interesting study in expression during the Captain&rsquo;s
      speech. From excited triumph it had fallen to fear and dejection; and now,
      out of the wreck, was appearing once more the oily smile, the sugared
      sweetness of the every-day Mr. Saunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge,&rdquo; purred the reconstructed one, &ldquo;you and me has always
      been good friends. We hadn&rsquo;t ought to fight like this. I don&rsquo;t think
      either of us wants to go to court. Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t fix the thing up
      some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it up when you pay me the seventy dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cap&rsquo;n Hedge, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;ve got seventy dollars in my pocket.
      Seems to me you&rsquo;re pretty hard on a poor feller that&rsquo;s jest been burnt
      out. I think we&rsquo;d ought to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much HAVE you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a good deal of talk and protestation Mr. Saunders acknowledged being
      the possessor of twenty-six dollars, divided between the cash drawer and
      his pocket. This he reluctantly handed to the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Captain demanded pen, ink, and paper; and when they were brought
      he laboriously wrote out a screed to the effect that Webster Saunders had
      received of Elsie Preston forty-four dollars, which sum he promised to pay
      on demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, pushing the writing materials across the table. &ldquo;Sign
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first Mr. Saunders positively refused to sign. Then he intimated that
      he had rather wait and think it over a little while. Finally he affixed
      his signature and spitefully threw the pen across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri folded up the paper and put it in his pocket. Then he rose and
      put on his pea jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s jest one thing more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Trot out that coat and hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trot out that coat and hat of John&rsquo;s. I want &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. It&rsquo;s all off. I&rsquo;ll step over and see the Jedge. You&rsquo;ll
      hear from him and me later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a minute, Cap&rsquo;n. You&rsquo;re in such a everlastin&rsquo; hurry. I don&rsquo;t care
      anything &lsquo;bout the old duds, but I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I know where they are.
      Seems to me they&rsquo;re up to the house somewheres. I&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;em to you
      to-morrer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;em to me right now. I&rsquo;ll tend shop while you go after &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment it looked as though the man of business would rebel outright.
      But the Captain was so calm, and evidently so determined to do exactly
      what he promised, that &ldquo;Web&rdquo; gave up in despair. Muttering that maybe they
      were &ldquo;&lsquo;round the place, after all,&rdquo; he went into the back room and
      reappeared with the burned coat and the scorched white felt hat. Slamming
      them down on the counter, he said sulkily, &ldquo;There they be. Any more of my
      prop&rsquo;ty you&rsquo;d like to have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri didn&rsquo;t answer. Coolly tearing off several sheets of wrapping
      paper from the roll at the back of the counter, he made a bundle of the
      hat and coat, and tucked it under his arm. Then he put on his own hat and
      started for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temper of the exasperated Mr. Saunders flared up in a final outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re almighty smart, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he growled between his
      teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll square up with you by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain turned sharply, his hand on the latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d try,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I jest wish to God you&rsquo;d try. I&rsquo;ve held in
      more &lsquo;n I thought I could when I come up here, but if you want to start a
      reel fust-class rumpus, one that &lsquo;ll land you where you b&rsquo;long and rid
      this town of you for keeps, jest try some of your tricks on me. And if I
      hear of one word that you&rsquo;ve said &lsquo;bout this whole bus&rsquo;ness, I&rsquo;ll know
      it&rsquo;s time to start in. Now, you can keep still or fight, jest as you
      please. I tell you honest, I &lsquo;most wish you&rsquo;d fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door slammed. Mr. Saunders opened it again and gazed vindictively
      after the bulky figure splashing through the slush. The dog came sneaking
      up and rubbed his nose against his master&rsquo;s hand; it was an impolitic move
      on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; roared Web, delighted at the opportunity. &ldquo;You good-for-nothin&rsquo; 
      pup! How&rsquo;s that set?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rdquo; was a kick that doubled the cur up against the settee. As it
      scrambled to its feet, Mr. Saunders kicked it again. And then the
      &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; exhibited the first evidence of spirit that it had ever been
      known to show. With a snarl, as the man turned away, it settled its teeth
      into the calf of his leg, and then shot out of the door and, with its tail
      between its legs, went down the road like a yellow cannon ball.

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THROUGH FIRE AND WATER
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was true&mdash;John Baxter was dead. His violent outbreak of the
      previous afternoon had hastened the end that the doctor had prophesied.
      There was no harrowing death scene. The weather-beaten old face grew
      calmer, and, the sleep sounder, until the tide went out&mdash;that was
      all. It was like a peaceful coming into port after a rough voyage. No one
      of the watchers about the bed could wish him back, not even Elsie, who was
      calm and brave through it all. When it was over, she went to her room and
      Mrs. Snow went with her. Captain Eri went out to make his call upon Mr.
      Saunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was one of the largest ever held in Orham. The little house
      was crowded. Old friends, who had drifted away from the fanatic in his
      latter days, came back to pay tribute to the strong man whom they had
      known and loved. There was some discussion among the captains as to who
      should preach the funeral sermon. Elsie had left this question to Captain
      Eri for settlement, and the trio and Mrs. Snow went into executive session
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If John had had the settlin&rsquo; of it himself,&rdquo; observed Eri, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d have
      picked Perley, there ain&rsquo;t no doubt &lsquo;bout that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Captain Perez, &ldquo;but you must remember that John wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      himself for years, and what he&rsquo;d have done now ain&rsquo;t what he&rsquo;d have done
      &lsquo;fore he broke down. I hate to think of Perley&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; it, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Perley a good man?&rdquo; asked the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good enough, fur&rsquo;s I know,&rdquo; replied Captain Jerry, &ldquo;but I know what
      Perez means. A funeral, seems to me, ought to be a quiet, soothin&rsquo; sort of
      a thing, and there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; soothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout Come-Outer&rsquo; preachin&rsquo;.
      He&rsquo;ll beller and rave &lsquo;round, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid, and stir up poor Elsie so she
      won&rsquo;t never git over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; agreed Captain Eri. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been afraid of. And
      yit,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I should feel we was doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; jest opposite from
      what John would like, if we had anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see Mr. Perley beforehand,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Snow, &ldquo;and tell
      him jest the kind of sermon he must preach. Tell him it must be quiet and
      comfortin&rsquo; and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And short.&rdquo; Captain Eri finished the sentence for her. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
      the way we&rsquo;ll have to settle it. I&rsquo;ll make him understand one thing,
      though&mdash;he mustn&rsquo;t drag in rum sellin&rsquo; and all the rest of it by the
      heels. If he does I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interview with the Reverend Perley that followed this conversation
      must have been effective, for the sermon was surprisingly brief and as
      surprisingly calm. In fact, so rational was it that a few of the more
      extreme among the preacher&rsquo;s following were a bit disappointed and
      inquired anxiously as to their leader&rsquo;s health, after the ceremony was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession of carryalls and buggies followed the hearse to the
      cemetery among the pines, and, as the mourners stood about the grave, the
      winter wind sang through the evergreen branches a song so like the roar of
      the surf that it seemed like a dirge of the sea for the mariner who would
      sail no more. As they were clearing away the supper dishes that night
      Captain Eri said to Mrs. Snow, &ldquo;Well, John&rsquo;s gone. I wonder if he&rsquo;s
      happier now than he has been for the last ten years or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so do I, but if he hadn&rsquo;t been a &lsquo;Come Outer&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose
      Brother Perley and his crowd would have figgered that he had much show.
      Seems sometimes as if folks like that&mdash;reel good-hearted folks, too,
      that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly&mdash;git solid comfort out of the feelin&rsquo; that
      everybody that don&rsquo;t agree with &lsquo;em is bound to everlastin&rsquo; torment. I
      don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s wicked to say it, but honest, it seems as if them kind
      would &lsquo;bout as soon give up the hopes of Heaven for themselves as they
      would the satisfaction of knowin&rsquo; &lsquo;twas t&rsquo;other place for the other
      feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which remark the somewhat shocked housekeeper made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day Elsie went back to her school. Captain Eri walked up
      with her, and, on the way, told her of his discovery of her secret, and of
      his interview with &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders. It was exactly as the Captain had
      surmised. The note she had received on the evening of the return from the
      life-saving station was from the proprietor of the billiard saloon, and in
      it he hinted at some dire calamity that overshadowed her grandfather, and
      demanded an immediate interview. She had seen him that night and, under
      threat of instant exposure, had promised to pay the sum required for
      silence. She had not wished to use her grandfather&rsquo;s money for this
      purpose, and so had taken the position as teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d have come to me right away, and
      told me the whole bus&rsquo;ness. &lsquo;Twould have saved a pile of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady stopped short and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Eri,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how could I? I was sure grandfather had set the
      fire. I knew how ill he was, and I knew that any shock might kill him.
      Besides, how could I drag you into it, when you had done so much already?
      It would have been dreadful. No, I thought it all out, and decided I must
      face it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you this, Elsie; pretty gin&rsquo;rally a mean dog &lsquo;ll bite if he
      sees you&rsquo;re afraid of him. The only way to handle that kind is to run
      straight at him and kick the meanness out of him. The more he barks the
      harder you ought to kick. If you run away once it &lsquo;ll be mighty
      uncomf&rsquo;table every time you go past that house. But never mind; I cal&rsquo;late
      this p&rsquo;tic&rsquo;lar pup won&rsquo;t bite; I&rsquo;ve pulled his teeth, I guess. What&rsquo;s your
      plans, now? Goin&rsquo; to keep on with the school, or go back to Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Preston didn&rsquo;t know; she said she had not yet decided, and, as the
      schoolhouse was reached by this time, the Captain said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, another question that troubled him, and that seemed to
      call for almost immediate settlement. It was: What should be done with
      Mrs. Snow? The housekeeper had been hired to act as such while John Baxter
      was in the house. Now he was gone, and there remained the original
      marriage agreement between Captain Jerry and the widow, and honor called
      for a decision one way or the other. Mrs. Snow, of course, said nothing
      about it, neither did Captain Jerry, and Captain Eri felt that he must
      take the initiative as usual. But, somehow, he was not as prompt as was
      his wont, and sat evening after evening, whittling at the clipper and
      smoking thoughtfully. And another week went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez might, and probably would, have suggested action upon this
      important matter, had not his mind been taken up with what, to him, was
      the most important of all. He had made up his mind to ask Patience Davis
      to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love is like the measles; it goes hard with a man past fifty, and Captain
      Perez was severely smitten. The decision just mentioned was not exactly a
      brand-new one, his mind had been made up for some time, but he lacked the
      courage to ask the momentous question. Something the lady had said during
      the first stages of their acquaintance made a great impression on the
      Captain. She gave it as her opinion that a man who loved a woman should be
      willing to go through fire and water to win her. Captain Perez went home
      that night pondering deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire and water!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a turrible test. But she&rsquo;s a wonderful
      woman, and would expect it of a feller. I wonder if I could do it; seems
      &lsquo;s if I would now, but flesh is weak, and I might flunk, and that would
      settle it. Fire and water! My! my! that&rsquo;s awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Captain delayed and Miss Patience, who had cherished hopes, found
      need of a good share of the virtue for which she was named.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one afternoon at the end of the week following that of the funeral,
      Perez set out for a call upon his intended which he meant should be a
      decisive one. He had screwed his courage up to the top notch, and as he
      told Captain Eri afterwards, he meant to &ldquo;hail her and git his bearin&rsquo;s,
      if he foundered the next minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found the lady alone, for old Mrs. Mayo had gone with her son, whose
      name was Abner, to visit a cousin in Harniss, and would not be back until
      late in the evening. Miss Patience was very glad to have company, and it
      required no great amount of urging to persuade the infatuated swain to
      stay to tea. When the meal was over&mdash;they washed the dishes together,
      and the Captain was so nervous that it is a wonder there was a whole plate
      left&mdash;the pair were seated in the parlor. Then said Captain Perez,
      turning red and hesitating, &ldquo;Pashy, do you know what a feller told me
      &lsquo;bout you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, this remark was purely a pleasant fiction, for the Captain was about
      to undertake a compliment, and was rather afraid to shoulder the entire
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t, Perez,&rdquo; replied Miss Davis, smiling sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a feller told me you was the best housekeeper in Orham. He said
      that the man that got you would be lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was encouraging. Miss Patience colored and simpered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sake!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Whoever told you such rubbish as that?
      Besides,&rdquo; with downcast eyes, &ldquo;I guess no man would ever want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The Captain moved uneasily in his chair, as if he
      contemplated hitching it nearer to that occupied by his companion. &ldquo;I
      guess there&rsquo;s plenty would be mighty glad to git you. Anyhow, there&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      one that&mdash;that&mdash;I cal&rsquo;late the fog&rsquo;s thick as ever, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Patience didn&rsquo;t mean to give up in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it you was goin&rsquo; to say?&rdquo; she asked, by way of giving the
      bashful one another chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; to say, Pashy, that&mdash;that&mdash;I asked if you thought
      the fog was as thick as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me! Yes, I s&rsquo;pose likely &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; was the discouraged answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me I never see such weather for this time of year. The ice is
      all out of the bay, and there ain&rsquo;t a bit of wind, and it&rsquo;s warm as
      summer, pretty nigh. Kind of a storm-breeder, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here to keep me comp&rsquo;ny. I&rsquo;ve never been sole alone
      in this house afore, and I should be dreadful lonesome if you hadn&rsquo;t
      come.&rdquo; This was offered as a fresh bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy, I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; I wanted to ask you. Do you think you could&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Perez?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask you&rdquo;&mdash;the Captain swallowed several times&mdash;&ldquo;to
      ask you&mdash;What in the nation is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; only the hens squawkin&rsquo;. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but hens don&rsquo;t squawk this time of night &lsquo;thout they have some
      reason to. It&rsquo;s that fox come back; that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Patience, earlier in the evening, had related a harrowing tale of the
      loss of two of Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s best Leghorns that had gone to furnish a Sunday
      meal for a marauding fox. As the said Leghorns were the pride of the old
      lady&rsquo;s heart, even the impending proposal was driven from Miss Davis&rsquo; 
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Perez! you don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose &lsquo;tis the fox, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, MA&rsquo;AM, I do! Where&rsquo;s the gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There &lsquo;tis, behind the door, but there ain&rsquo;t a mite of shot in the house.
      Abner&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; to fetch some from the store for I don&rsquo;t know how long,
      but he&rsquo;s always forgot it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll pound the critter with the butt. Come quick, and bring a
      lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise in the henyard continued, and when they opened the door it was
      louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the henhouse,&rdquo; whispered Miss Patience. &ldquo;He must have gone in
      that hole at the side that had the loose board over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; murmured the Captain. &ldquo;You go &lsquo;round with the lamp and open
      the door. That &lsquo;ll scare him, and I&rsquo;ll stand at the hole and thump him
      when he comes out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, shielding the lamp with her apron, the guardian of Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s
      outraged Leghorns tiptoed around to the henhouse door, while Captain
      Perez, brandishing the gun like a club, took up his stand by the hole at
      the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the lamp the darkness was pitchy. The Captain, stooping down to
      watch, saw something coming out of the hole&mdash;something that was alive
      and moved. He swung the gun above his head, and, bringing it down with all
      his might, knocked into eternal oblivion the little life remaining in the
      finest Leghorn rooster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consarn it!&rdquo; yelled the executioner, stooping and laying his hand on the
      victim, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed a hen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there came a scream from the other side of the henhouse,
      followed by a crash and the sound of a fall. Running around the corner the
      alarmed Perez saw his lady-love stretched upon the ground, groaning
      dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great land of Goshen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Pashy, are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Perez!&rdquo; gasped the fallen one. &ldquo;Oh, Perez!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This pitiful appeal had such an effect upon the Captain that he dropped
      upon his knees and, raising Miss Davis&rsquo; head in his hands, begged her to
      say she wasn&rsquo;t killed. After some little time she obligingly complied, and
      then, having regained her breath, explained the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened was this: The fox, having selected his victim the
      rooster, had rendered it helpless, and was pushing it out of the hole
      ahead of him. The Captain had struck the rooster just as Miss Patience
      opened the door, and the fox, seizing this chance of escape, had dodged by
      the lady, upsetting her as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no great harm done. I&rsquo;m sorry for the
      rooster, but I guess the fox had fixed him anyway. Oh, my soul and body!
      look there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez turned, looked as directed, and saw the henhouse in flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lighted lamp, which Miss Patience had dropped as she fell, lay broken
      on the floor, and the blazing oil had run in every direction. The flames
      were making such headway that they both saw there was practically no
      chance of saving the building. The frightened hens were huddled in the
      furthest corner, gazing stupidly at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, those poor Leghorns!&rdquo; wailed Miss Patience. &ldquo;Those hens Mrs. Mayo
      thought the world of, and left me to look out for. Last thing she asked me
      was to be sure they was fed. And now they&rsquo;ll be all burned up! What SHALL
      I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the lady began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy!&rdquo; roared the Captain, whom the sight of his charmer&rsquo;s tears had
      driven almost wild, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say another word. I&rsquo;ll save them hens or git
      cooked along with &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning up his coat collar, as though he was going into a refrigerator
      instead of a burning building, Captain Perez sprang through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Davis screamed wildly to him to come back, and danced about, wringing
      her hands. The interior of the henhouse was now a mass of black smoke,
      from which the voices of the Captain and the Leghorns floated in a
      discordant medley, something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold still, you lunatics! (&lsquo;Squawk! squawk!&rsquo;) Druther be roasted than
      have me catch you, hadn&rsquo;t you? (&lsquo;Squawk! squawk!&rsquo;) A&mdash;kershew! Land!
      I&rsquo;m smothered! NOW I&rsquo;ve got you! Thunderation! Hold STILL! HOLD STILL, I
      tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as the agonized Miss Patience was on the point of fainting, the
      little window at the back of the shanty was thrown open and two hens, like
      feathered comets, shot through it. Then the red face of the Captain
      appeared for an instant as he caught his breath with a &ldquo;Woosh!&rdquo; and dived
      back again. This performance was repeated six times, the Captain&rsquo;s
      language and the compliments he paid the hens becoming more picturesque
      every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he announced, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, thank goodness!&rdquo; and began to climb
      through the window. This was a difficult task; for the window was narrow
      and, in spite of what Captain Eri had called his &ldquo;ingy-rubber&rdquo; make up,
      Captain Perez stuck fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch hold of my hands and haul, will you, Pashy?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      it; pull hard! It&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; sort of muggy in behind here. I&rsquo;ll never
      complain at havin&rsquo; cold feet ag&rsquo;in if I git out of this. Now, then! Ugh!
      Here we be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came out with a jerk, like a cork out of a bottle, and rolled on the
      ground at his lady&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Perez!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but my feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; growled the rescuer, scrambling upright. &ldquo;I
      read a book once by a feller named Joshua Billin&rsquo;s, or somethin&rsquo; like it.
      He was a ignorant chap&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t spell two words right&mdash;but he
      had consider&rsquo;ble sense. He said a hen was a darn fool, and he was right;
      she&rsquo;s all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s face was blackened, and his clothes were scorched, but his
      spirit was undaunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you realize that if we don&rsquo;t git help, this whole
      shebang, house and all, will burn down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez, you don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t swear that I didn&rsquo;t. Look how that thing&rsquo;s blazin&rsquo;! There&rsquo;s
      the barn t&rsquo;other side of it, and the house t&rsquo;other side of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you and me put it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare resk it. No, sir! We&rsquo;ve got to git help, and git it in a
      hurry, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t somebody from the station see the light and come over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this fog. You can&rsquo;t see a hundred foot. No, I&rsquo;ve got to go right
      off. Good land! I never thought! Is the horse gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the horse is here. Abner took one of the store horses to go to
      Harniss with. But he did take the buggy, and there&rsquo;s no other carriage but
      the old carryall, and that&rsquo;s almost tumblin&rsquo; to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to go horseback.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and leave me here alone with the house afire? No, indeed! If you
      go, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, the carryll&rsquo;s got to do, whether or no. Git on a shawl or
      somethin&rsquo;, while I harness up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a frantic harnessing, but it was done in a hurry, and the
      ramshackle old carryall, dusty and cobwebbed, was dragged out of the barn,
      and Horace Greeley, the horse, was backed into the shafts. As they drove
      out of the yard the flames were roaring through the roof of the henhouse,
      and the lath fence surrounding it was beginning to blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s so wet from the fog and the melted snow,&rdquo; observed the
      Captain, &ldquo;that it &lsquo;ll take some time for the fire to git to the barn. If
      we can git a gang here we can save the house easy, and maybe more. By
      mighty!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;I tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll drive across the
      ford and git Luther and some of the station men to come right across. Then
      I&rsquo;ll go on to the village to fetch more. It was seven when I looked at the
      clock as we come in from washin&rsquo; dishes, so the tide must be still goin&rsquo; 
      out, and the ford jest right. Git dap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry all you can, for goodness&rsquo; sake! Is this as fast as we can go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fast as we can go with this everlastin&rsquo; Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Heavens! how them
      wheels squeal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The axles ain&rsquo;t been greased for I don&rsquo;t know when. Abner was going to
      have the old carriage chopped up for kindlin&rsquo; wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky for him and us &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t chopped up now. Git dap, slow-poke! Better
      chop the horse up, too, while he&rsquo;s &lsquo;bout it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last remark the Captain made under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My gracious, how dark it is! Think you can find the crossin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GOT to find it; that&rsquo;s all. &lsquo;Tis dark, that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was. They had gone but a few hundred yards; yet the fire was already
      merely a shapeless, red smudge on the foggy blackness behind them. Horace
      Greeley pounded along at a jog, and when the Captain slapped him with the
      end of the reins, broke into a jerky gallop that was slower than the trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your hoppin&rsquo; up and down!&rdquo; commanded Perez, whose temper was
      becoming somewhat frayed. &ldquo;You make me think of the walkin&rsquo; beam on a
      steamboat. If you&rsquo;d stop tryin&rsquo; to fly and go straight ahead we&rsquo;d do
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They progressed in this fashion for some distance. Then Miss Davis, from
      the curtained depths of the back seat, spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you sure you&rsquo;re on the right track?
      Seems &lsquo;s if we MUST be abreast the station, and this road&rsquo;s awful rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez had remarked the roughness of the road. The carryall was
      pitching from one hummock to another, and Horace Greeley stumbled once or
      twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; commanded the Captain. Then he got down, lit a match, and,
      shielding it with his hands, scrutinized the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of &lsquo;fraid,&rdquo;
       he said presently, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve got off the road somehow. But we must be
      &lsquo;bout opposite the crossin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to drive down and see if I can find
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the horse&rsquo;s head at right angles from the way they were going,
      and they pitched onward for another hundred yards. Then they came out upon
      the hard, smooth sand, and heard the water lapping on the shore. Captain
      Perez got out once more and walked along the strand, bending forward as he
      walked. Soon Miss Patience heard him calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it, I guess,&rdquo; he said, coming back to the vehicle. &ldquo;Anyhow, it
      looks like it. We&rsquo;ll be over in a few minutes now. Git dap, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Horace Greeley shivered as the cold water splashed his legs, but waded
      bravely in. They moved further from the shore and the water seemed to grow
      no deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess this is the crossin&rsquo; all right,&rdquo; said the Captain, who had
      cherished some secret doubts. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the deep part comin&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ll be
      across in a jiffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The water mounted to the hubs, then to the bottom of the carryall. Miss
      Davis&rsquo; feet grew damp and she drew them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Perez!&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;are you sure this is the ford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t git scared, Pashy! I guess maybe we&rsquo;ve got a little to one side of
      the track. I&rsquo;ll turn &lsquo;round and try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Horace Greeley was of a different mind. From long experience he knew
      that the way to cross a ford was to go straight ahead. The bottom of the
      carryall was awash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Port your hellum, you lubber!&rdquo; shouted the driver, pulling with all his
      might on one rein. &ldquo;Heave to! Come &lsquo;bout! Gybe! consarn you! gybe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Horace Greeley tried to obey orders, but it was too late. He
      endeavored to touch bottom with his forelegs, but could not; tried to swim
      with his hind ones, but found that impossible; then wallowed wildly to one
      side and snapped a shaft and the rotten whiffletree short off. The
      carryall tipped alarmingly and Miss Patience screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; yelled the agitated Perez. &ldquo;&lsquo;Vast heavin&rsquo;! belay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The animal, as much frightened by his driver&rsquo;s shouts as by the water,
      shot ahead and tried to tear himself loose. The other sun-warped and
      rotten shaft broke. The carryall was now floating, with the water covering
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use; I&rsquo;ll have to cut away the wreck, or we&rsquo;ll be on our beam ends!&rdquo;
       shouted the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his jackknife, and reaching over, severed the traces. Horace
      Greeley gave another wallow, and finding himself free, disappeared in the
      darkness amid a lather of foam. The carriage, now well out in the channel,
      drifted with the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Pashy!&rdquo; said the Captain, endeavoring to cheer his sobbing
      companion, &ldquo;we ain&rsquo;t shark bait yit. As the song used to say:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re afloat, we&rsquo;re afloat,
     And the rover is free.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shipped aboard of &lsquo;most every kind of craft,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but blessed
      if I ever expected to be skipper of a carryall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Patience, shut up in the back part of the carriage like a water
      nymph in her cave, still wept hysterically. So Captain Perez continued his
      dismal attempt at facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The main thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to keep her on an even keel. If she teeters
      to one side, you teeter to t&rsquo;other. Drat that fox!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;I
      thought when Web&rsquo;s place burned we&rsquo;d had fire enough to last for one
      spell, but it never rains but it pours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sobbed the lady. &ldquo;Now everything &lsquo;ll burn up, and they&rsquo;ll
      blame me for it. Well, I&rsquo;ll be drownded anyway, so I shan&rsquo;t be there to
      hear &lsquo;em. Oh, dear! dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk that way. We&rsquo;re driftin&rsquo; somewheres, but we&rsquo;re spinnin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;round so I can&rsquo;t tell which way. Judas!&rdquo; he exclaimed, more soberly, &ldquo;I
      remember, now; it ain&rsquo;t but a little past seven o&rsquo;clock, and the tide&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; resignedly, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll drift into the breakers in the
      bay, and that &lsquo;ll be the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I guess not. We ain&rsquo;t dead yit. If I had an oar or somethin&rsquo; to
      steer this clipper with, maybe we could git into shoal water. As &lsquo;tis,
      we&rsquo;ll have to manage her the way Ote Wixon used to manage his wife, by
      lettin&rsquo; her have her own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They floated in silence for a few moments. Then Miss Patience, who had
      bravely tried to stifle her sobs, said with chattering teeth, &ldquo;Perez, I&rsquo;m
      pretty nigh froze to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that the Captain had spoken of the weather as being
      almost as warm as summer. This was a slight exaggeration. It happened,
      fortunately for the castaways, that this particular night, coming as it
      did just at the end of the long thaw, was the mildest of the winter and
      there was no wind, but the air was chill, and the damp fog raw and biting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now you mention it,&rdquo; said Captain Perez, &ldquo;it IS cold, ain&rsquo;t it?
      I&rsquo;ve a good mind to jump overboard, and try to swim ashore and tow the
      carryall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you DO it! My land! if YOU should drown what would become of ME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the tone of this speech, as much as the words, that hit the Captain
      hard. He himself almost sobbed as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy, I want you to try to git over on this front seat with me. Then I
      can put my coat &lsquo;round you, and you won&rsquo;t be so cold. Take hold of my
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Patience at first protested that she never could do it in the world,
      the carriage would upset, and that would be the end. But her companion
      urged her to try, and at last she did so. It was a risky proceeding, but
      she reached the front seat somehow, and the carryall still remained
      right-side-up. Luckily, in the channel between the beaches there was not
      the slightest semblance of a wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez pulled off his coat, and wrapped it about his protesting
      companion. He was obliged to hold it in place, and he found the task
      rather pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re SO good!&rdquo; murmured Miss Patience. &ldquo;What should I have done
      without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Guess you&rsquo;d have been better off. You&rsquo;d never gone after that fox
      if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been none of this fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! You&rsquo;ve been so brave. Anyhow, we&rsquo;ll die together,
      that&rsquo;s a comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy,&rdquo; said Captain Perez solemnly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mighty good to hear you say
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is, perhaps, needless to explain that the &ldquo;dying&rdquo; portion of the lady&rsquo;s
      speech was not that referred to by the Captain; the word &ldquo;together&rdquo; was
      what appealed to him. Miss Patience apparently understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, &lsquo;tis.&rdquo; The arm holding the coat about the lady&rsquo;s shoulder
      tightened just a little. The Captain had often dreamed of something like
      this, but never with quite these surroundings. However, he was rapidly
      becoming oblivious to such trivial details as surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pashy,&rdquo; he said huskily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; of you consider&rsquo;ble lately.
      Fact is, I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I come down to-day a-purpose to ask you
      somethin&rsquo;. I know it&rsquo;s a queer place to ask it, and&mdash;and I s&rsquo;pose
      it&rsquo;s kind of sudden, but&mdash;will&mdash;will you&mdash;Breakers! by
      mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carryall had suddenly begun to rock, and there were streaks of foam
      about it. Now, it gave a most alarming heave, grounded, swung clear, and
      tipped yet more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re capsizin&rsquo;,&rdquo; yelled Perez. &ldquo;Hang on to me, Pashy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Patience didn&rsquo;t intend to let this, perhaps the final
      opportunity, slip. As she told her brother afterward, she would have made
      him say it then if they had been &ldquo;two fathom under water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I what, Perez?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carryall rose on two wheels and begun to turn over, but the Captain
      did not notice it. The arms of his heart&rsquo;s desire were about his neck, and
      he was looking into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Miss Patience, and they went under together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain staggered to his feet, and dragged his chosen bride to hers.
      The ice-cold water reached their shoulders. And, like a flash, as they
      stood there, came a torrent of rain and a wind that drove the fog before
      it like smoke. Captain Perez saw the shore, with its silhouetted bushes,
      only a few yards away. Beyond that, in the blackness, was a light, a
      flickering blaze, that rose and fell and rose and fell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain dragged Miss Patience to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; he chattered, &ldquo;run, or we&rsquo;ll turn into icicles. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his arm about her waist Perez guided his dripping companion, as fast
      as they could run, toward the light. And as they came nearer to it they
      saw that it flickered about the blackened ruins of a hen-house and a lath
      fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s henhouse, and Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s fence. Their adventurous
      journey had ended where it began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Eri,&rdquo; said Captain Perez, as he told his friend the story that
      night, &ldquo;that clock in the dining room that I looked at hadn&rsquo;t been goin&rsquo; 
      for a week; the mainspring was broke. &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t seven o&rsquo;clock, &lsquo;twas nearer
      nine when the fire started, and the tide wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; out, &lsquo;twas comin&rsquo; 
      in. I drove into the water too soon, missed the crossin&rsquo;, and we jest
      drifted back home ag&rsquo;in. The horse had more sense than I did. We found him
      in the barn waiting for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abner Mayo had piled against the back of his barn a great heap of damp
      seaweed that he intended using in the spring as a fertilizer. The fire had
      burned until it reached this seaweed and then had gone no further. The
      rain extinguished the last spark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by mighty!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Perez for at least the tenth time, as
      he sat in the kitchen, wrapped in an old ulster of Mr. Mayo&rsquo;s, and
      toasting his feet in the oven, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t feel like a fool. All that
      scare and wet for nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not for nothin&rsquo;, Perez,&rdquo; said Miss Patience, looking tenderly down
      into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not for nothin&rsquo; by a good deal! I&rsquo;ve got you by it, and that&rsquo;s
      everything. But say, Pashy!&rdquo; and the Captain looked awed by the
      coincidence, &ldquo;I went through fire and water to git you!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SINS OF CAPTAIN JERRY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Captain Perez made a clean breast of it to Captain Eri when he reached
      home that night. It was after twelve o&rsquo;clock, but he routed his friend out
      of bed to tell him the news and the story. Captain Eri was not as
      surprised to hear of the engagement as he pretended to be, for he had long
      ago made up his mind that Perez meant business this time. But the tale of
      the fire and the voyage in the carryall tickled him immensely, and he
      rolled back and forth in the rocker and laughed until his side ached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it does sound kind of ridic&rsquo;lous,&rdquo; said the accepted suitor in a
      rather aggrieved tone, &ldquo;but it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;f so funny when &lsquo;twas goin&rsquo; on.
      Fust I thought I&rsquo;d roast to death, then I thought I&rsquo;d freeze, and then I
      thought I&rsquo;d drown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez,&rdquo; said the panting Eri, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a wonder. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell Sol
      Bangs &lsquo;bout you next time I see him. He&rsquo;ll want you to enter in the races
      next Fourth of July. We&rsquo;ve had tub races and the like of that, but a
      carryall sailin&rsquo; match &lsquo;ll be somethin&rsquo; new. I&rsquo;ll back you against the
      town, though. You can count on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, Eri Hedge, if you tell a livin&rsquo; soul &lsquo;bout it, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, shipmate, all right; but it&rsquo;s too good to keep. You ought to
      write a book, one of them kind like Josiah used to read. Call it &lsquo;The
      Carryall Pirate, or The Terror of the Channel,&rsquo; hey? Gee! you&rsquo;d be famous!
      But, say, old man,&rdquo; he added more seriously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shake hands with you. I
      b&rsquo;lieve you&rsquo;ve got a good woman, one that &lsquo;ll make it smooth sailin&rsquo; for
      you the rest of your life. I wish you both luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez shook hands very gravely. He was still a little suspicious
      of his chum&rsquo;s propensity to tease. It did not tend to make him less uneasy
      when, a little later, Captain Eri opened the parlor door and whispered,
      &ldquo;Say, Perez, I&rsquo;ve jest thought of some-thin&rsquo;. What are you goin&rsquo; to say to
      M&rsquo;lissy Busteed? Her heart &lsquo;ll be broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, git out!&rdquo; was the disgusted answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I only mentioned it. Folks have had to pay heavy for breach of
      promise &lsquo;fore now. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perez manfully told of his engagement at the breakfast table next morning,
      although he said nothing concerning the rest of his adventures. He was
      rather taken aback to find that no one seemed greatly surprised. Everyone
      congratulated him, of course, and it was gratifying to discern the high
      opinion of the future Mrs. Ryder held by Mrs. Snow and the rest. Captain
      Jerry solemnly shook hands with him after the meal was over and said,
      &ldquo;Perez, you done the right thing. There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like married life, after
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you try it yourself?&rdquo; was the unexpected question. &ldquo;Seems
      to me we&rsquo;ll have to settle that matter of yours pretty soon. I meant to
      speak to Eri &lsquo;bout it &lsquo;fore this, but I&rsquo;ve had so much on my mind. I will
      to-night when he comes back from fishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry made no further remarks, but walked thoughtfully away.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that evening, when they were together in Captain Jerry&rsquo;s room after
      supper, Perez, true to his promise, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri, it seems to me we&rsquo;ve got to do somethin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout Mrs. Snow. She was
      hired to be housekeeper while John was sick. Now he&rsquo;s dead, and she&rsquo;ll
      think it&rsquo;s queer if we don&rsquo;t settle that marryin&rsquo; bus&rsquo;ness. Ain&rsquo;t that
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Jerry. &ldquo;Perez is in a mighty sweat to git other
      folks married jest &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be. I don&rsquo;t see why she can&rsquo;t keep
      on bein&rsquo; housekeeper jest the same as she&rsquo;s always been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, and so do you, and you know it. We agreed to the housekeepin&rsquo; 
      bus&rsquo;ness jest as a sort of put off. Now we can&rsquo;t put off no longer. Mrs.
      Snow come down here &lsquo;cause we advertised for a wife, and she&rsquo;s been so
      everlastin&rsquo; good that I feel &lsquo;most ashamed every time I think of it. No
      use, you&rsquo;ve got to ask her to marry you. He has, hasn&rsquo;t he, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Captain Eri laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifice squirmed. &ldquo;I hate to ask,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we wait a
      spell, and let her say somethin&rsquo; fust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That WOULD be nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it? She&rsquo;s that kind of a woman, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
       sputtered Perez. &ldquo;No, you bet she ain&rsquo;t! What she&rsquo;d say would be to give
      her opinion of us and our manners, and walk out of the house bag and
      baggage, and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her for doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps she wouldn&rsquo;t have me. She never said she would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never said she would! Have you ever asked her? She&rsquo;s had all this time to
      l&rsquo;arn to know you in, and I cal&rsquo;late if she was willin&rsquo; to think &lsquo;bout it
      &lsquo;fore she ever see you, she&rsquo;d be more willin&rsquo; now. Ain&rsquo;t that so, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again Captain Eri said shortly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d mind your own consarns, and give me time,&rdquo; protested Captain
      Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time! How much time do you want? Land of Goshen! I should think you&rsquo;d had
      time enough. Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let up!&rdquo; snorted the persecuted. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you git married yourself,
      and bring Pashy over to keep house? What we started to git in the fust
      place was jest a wife for one of us that would keep things shipshape, and
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The withering look of scorn that Perez bent upon him caused him to
      hesitate and stop. Captain Perez haughtily marched to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to waste my time talkin&rsquo; to a&mdash;a
      dogfish like him. He ain&rsquo;t wuth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, now, Perez!&rdquo; pleaded the discomfited sacrifice, alarmed at his
      comrade&rsquo;s threatened desertion. &ldquo;I was only foolin&rsquo;. Can&rsquo;t you take a
      joke? I haven&rsquo;t said I wouldn&rsquo;t do it. I think a heap of Mrs. Snow; it&rsquo;s
      only that I ain&rsquo;t got the spunk to ask her, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! it don&rsquo;t take much spunk,&rdquo; replied the successful wooer, forgetful
      of his own past trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Captain Jerry wriggled and twisted, but saw no loophole. &ldquo;Well,
      give me a month to git up my courage in and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month! A month&rsquo;s ridic&rsquo;lous; ain&rsquo;t it, Eri&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, three weeks, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This offer, too, was rejected. Then Captain Jerry held out for a fortnight&mdash;for
      ten days. Finally, it was settled that within one week from that very
      night he was to offer his heart and hand to the lady from Nantucket. He
      pledged his solemn word to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the gratified Captain Perez. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good job done.
      He won&rsquo;t never be sorry for it, will he, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Eri made his fourth contribution to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josiah went up to the post-office late in the afternoon of the next day.
      The &ldquo;able seaman&rdquo; was behaving himself remarkably well. He had become a
      real help to Captain Eri, and the latter said that sailing alone would be
      doubly hard when his foremast hand went back to school again, which he was
      to do very shortly, for Josiah meant to accept the Captain&rsquo;s offer, and to
      try for the Annapolis appointment when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy came back with the mail and an item of news. The mail, a paper
      only, he handed to Mrs. Snow, and the news he announced at the supper
      table as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to leave the cable station,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to leave!&rdquo; repeated the housekeeper, &ldquo;what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am. All I know is what I heard Mr. Wingate say. He said
      Mr. Hazeltine was goin&rsquo; to get through over at the station pretty soon. He
      said one of the operators told him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the land&rsquo;s sake! Did you know anything &lsquo;bout it, Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, a little. I met Hazeltine yesterday, and he told me that some
      folks out West had made him a pretty good offer, and he didn&rsquo;t know
      whether to take it or not. Said the salary was good, and the whole thing
      looked sort of temptin&rsquo;. He hadn&rsquo;t decided what to do yit. That&rsquo;s all
      there is to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was little else talked about during the meal. Captain Perez, Captain
      Jerry, and Mrs. Snow argued, surmised, and questioned Captain Eri, who
      said little. Elsie said almost nothing, and went to her room shortly after
      the dishes were washed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Perez, when they were alone, &ldquo;I guess your
      match-makin&rsquo; scheme&rsquo;s up spout, Jerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, for a wonder, Captain Jerry did not contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather changed that night, and it grew cold rapidly. In the morning
      the pump was frozen, and Captain Jerry and Mrs. Snow spent some time and
      much energy in thawing it out. It was later than usual when the former set
      out for the schoolhouse. As he was putting on his cap, Elsie suggested
      that he wait for her, as she had some lessons to prepare, and wanted an
      hour or so to herself at her desk. So they walked on together under a
      cloudy sky. The mud in the road was frozen into all sorts of fantastic
      shapes, and the little puddles had turned to ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thaw was a weather-breeder, sure enough,&rdquo; observed Captain Jerry.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git a storm out of this, &lsquo;fore we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Elsie, &ldquo;that the winter has been a very mild one.
      From what I had heard I supposed you must have some dreadful gales here,
      but there has been none so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll git &lsquo;em yit. February&rsquo;s jist the time. Git a good no&rsquo;theaster
      goin&rsquo;, and you&rsquo;ll think the whole house is comin&rsquo; down. Nothin&rsquo; to what
      they used to have, though, &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to tell. Cap&rsquo;n Jonadab Wixon used to
      swear that his grandfather told him &lsquo;bout a gale that blew the hair all
      off a dog, and then the wind changed of a sudden, and blew it all on
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie laughed. &ldquo;That must have been a blow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Cap&rsquo;n Jonadab&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; of a blow himself, so he ought to be a
      good jedge. The outer beach is the place that catches it when there&rsquo;s a
      gale on. Oh, say! that reminds me. I s&rsquo;pose you was glad to hear the news
      last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that &lsquo;bout Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away. You&rsquo;re glad he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Preston did not answer immediately. Instead, she turned and looked
      wonderingly at her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be glad, pray?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. I jest took it for granted you would be. You didn&rsquo;t
      want him to come and see you, and if he was gone he couldn&rsquo;t come, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute, please. What makes you think I didn&rsquo;t want Mr. Hazeltine
      to call?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now it was the Captain&rsquo;s turn to stare and hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes me think&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Why&mdash;you told me so,
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> told you so? I&rsquo;m certain that I never told you anything of the
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry stood stock-still, and if ever a face expressed complete
      amazement, it was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie Preston!&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;are you losin&rsquo; your mem&rsquo;ry or what?
      Didn&rsquo;t you pitch into me hot-foot for lettin&rsquo; him be alone with you?
      Didn&rsquo;t you give me &lsquo;hark from the tomb&rsquo; for gittin&rsquo; up and goin&rsquo; away?
      Didn&rsquo;t you say his calls was perfect torture to you, and that you had to
      be decent to him jest out of common politeness? Now, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was it! No, of course I didn&rsquo;t say any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DIDN&rsquo;T! Why, I heard you! Land of love! my ears smarted for a week
      afterward. I ain&rsquo;t had sech a goin&rsquo; over sence mother used to git at me
      for goin&rsquo; in swimmin&rsquo; on Sunday. And now you say you didn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. You misunderstood me. I did object to your leaving the room
      every time he called, and making me appear so ridiculous; and I did say
      that his visits might be a torture for all that you knew to the contrary,
      but I certainly didn&rsquo;t say that they WERE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SUFFERIN&rsquo;! And you ain&rsquo;t glad he stopped comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The air of complete indifference assumed by the young lady was a triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine is a free agent, and I don&rsquo;t
      know of any reason why he should be compelled to go where he doesn&rsquo;t wish
      to go. I enjoyed his society, and I&rsquo;m sure Captain Eri and Mrs. Snow
      enjoyed it, too; but it is quite evident that he did not enjoy ours, so I
      don&rsquo;t see that there need be any more said on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry was completely crushed. If the gale described by the
      redoubtable grandsire of Jonadab Wixon had struck him, he could not have
      been more upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! my! my!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And after my beggin&rsquo; his pardon and all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging his pardon? For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for leavin&rsquo; you two alone. Of course, after you pitched into me so I
      see how foolish I&rsquo;d been actin&rsquo;, and I&mdash;honest, I didn&rsquo;t sleep
      scursely a bit that night thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it. Thinks I, &lsquo;If Elsie feels
      that way, why, there ain&rsquo;t no doubt that Mr. Hazeltine feels the same.&rsquo; 
      There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t but one thing to be done. When a man makes a mistake, if he
      is any kind of a man, he owns up, and does his best to straighten things
      out. &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t easy to do, but duty&rsquo;s duty, and the next time I see Mr.
      Hazeltine I told him the whole thing, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DID!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped on the sidewalk nearly opposite the post-office. Each was
      too much engrossed in the conversation to pay any heed to anything else.
      If the few passersby thought it strange that the schoolmistress should
      care to loiter out of doors on that cold and disagreeable morning, they
      said nothing about it. One young man in particular, who, standing just
      inside the post-office door, was buttoning his overcoat and putting on his
      gloves, looked earnestly at the pair, but he, too, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I told him,&rdquo; said Captain Jerry, in reply to the question, &ldquo;how you
      didn&rsquo;t like to have me go out of the room when he was there. Course, I
      told him I didn&rsquo;t mean to do nothin&rsquo; out of the way. Then he asked me some
      more questions, and I answered &lsquo;em best I could, and&mdash;well, I guess
      that&rsquo;s &lsquo;bout all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell him that I said his visits were a torture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; the Captain shuffled his feet uneasily&mdash;&ldquo;seems to me I
      said somethin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it&mdash;not jest that, you know, but somethin&rsquo;. Fact
      is, I was so muddle-headed and upset that I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I did
      say. Anyhow, he said &lsquo;twas all right, so there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to worry
      &lsquo;bout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Jeremiah Burgess!&rdquo; exclaimed Elsie. Then she added, &ldquo;What MUST he
      think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll fix that!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him some time
      to-day, and I&rsquo;ll tell him you didn&rsquo;t mean it. Why, I declare! Yes, &lsquo;tis!
      There he is, now! Hi! Mr. Hazeltine! Come here a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mischievous imp was certainly directing Captain Jerry&rsquo;s movements. Ralph
      had, almost for the first time since he came to Orham, paid an early
      morning visit to the office in order to send an important letter in the
      first mail. The slamming of the door had attracted the Captain&rsquo;s attention
      and, in response to the hail, Mr. Hazeltine crossed the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Captain Jerry felt his arm clutched with a grip that meant
      business, as Miss Preston whispered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare say one word to him
      about it. Don&rsquo;t you DARE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Ralph had been surprised by the request to join the couple, he was more
      surprised by the reception he received. Elsie&rsquo;s face was crimson, and as
      for the Captain, he looked like a man who had suddenly been left standing
      alone in the middle of a pond covered with very thin ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician bowed and shook hands gravely. As no remark seemed to be
      forthcoming from those who had summoned him, he observed that it was an
      unpleasant morning. This commonplace reminded him of one somewhat similar
      that he had made to a supposed Miss &ldquo;Gusty&rdquo; Black, and he, too, colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want to speak with me, Captain?&rdquo; he asked, to cover his
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I did,&rdquo; stammered poor Captain Jerry, &ldquo;but&mdash;but I
      don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I do now.&rdquo; Then he realized that this was not exactly
      complimentary, and added, &ldquo;That is, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I&mdash;Elsie,
      what was it I was goin&rsquo; to say to Mr. Hazeltine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At another time it is likely that the young lady&rsquo;s quick wit would have
      helped her out of the difficulty, but now she was too much disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know! Why, yes you do? &lsquo;Twas&mdash;&lsquo;twas&mdash;&rdquo; The Captain
      was frantically grasping at straws. &ldquo;Why, we was wonderin&rsquo; why you didn&rsquo;t
      come to see us nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the Captain had seen the look that Elsie shot at him, as he delivered
      this brilliant observation, he might have been more, instead of less,
      uncomfortable. As it was, he felt rather proud of having discovered a way
      out of the difficulty. But Ralph&rsquo;s embarrassment increased. He hurriedly
      said something about having been very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on the Captain, intent on making the explanation as plausible
      as possible, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve missed you consider&rsquo;ble. We was sayin&rsquo; we hoped you
      wouldn&rsquo;t give us up altogether. Ain&rsquo;t that so, Elsie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Preston&rsquo;s foot tapped the sidewalk several times, but she answered,
      though not effusively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine is always welcome, of course.&rdquo; Then, she added, turning
      away, &ldquo;Really, Captain Jerry, I must hurry to school. I have a great deal
      of work to do before nine o&rsquo;clock. Good-morning, Mr. Hazeltine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain paused long enough to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll expect you now, so come,&rdquo;
       and then hurried after her. He was feeling very well satisfied with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mighty! Elsie,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;I got out of that nice, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He received no answer, even when he repeated the remark, and, although he
      endeavored, as he swept out the schoolroom, to engage the teacher in
      conversation, her replies were as cold as they were short. The Captain
      went home in the last stages of dismalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, when Captain Eri returned from the fishing grounds, he
      found Captain Jerry waiting for him at the shanty. The humiliated
      matchmaker sent Josiah up to the grocery store on an errand, and then
      dragged his friend inside and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri looked at the woe-begone face with some concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you, Jerry?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Have you&mdash;have you spoken to
      Mrs. Snow &lsquo;bout that&mdash;that marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t, Eri, but I&rsquo;m in a turrible mess, and I don&rsquo;t know why,
      neither. Seems to me the more I try to do for other folks the wuss off I
      am; and, instead of gittin&rsquo; thanks, all I git is blame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now I know you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m a fool, and &lsquo;ll jest pester the life
      out of me. See here, Eri Hedge! If I tell you what I want to, will you
      promise not to pitch into me, and not to nag and poke fun? If you don&rsquo;t
      promise I won&rsquo;t tell one single word, no matter what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Captain Eri promised, and then Captain Jerry, stammering and
      hesitating, unburdened his mind of the whole affair, telling of his first
      reproof by Elsie, his &ldquo;explanation&rdquo; to Ralph, and the subsequent
      developments. Long before he finished, Captain Eri rose and, walking over
      to the door, stood looking out through the dim pane at the top, while his
      shoulders shook as if there was a smothered earthquake inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the injured matrimonial agent, in conclusion. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      the whole fool thing, and I &lsquo;most wish I&rsquo;d never seen either of &lsquo;em. I
      thought I did fust-rate this mornin&rsquo; when I was tryin&rsquo; to think up
      somethin&rsquo; to show why I hailed Hazeltine, but no, Elsie won&rsquo;t hardly speak
      to me. I wish to goodness you&rsquo;d tell me what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri turned away from the door. His eyes were watery, and his face
      was red, but he managed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jerry, Jerry! Your heart&rsquo;s big as a bucket, but fishin&rsquo; &lsquo;s more in
      your line than gittin&rsquo; folks married to order is, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid. You stay
      here, and unload them fish in the dory. There ain&rsquo;t many of &lsquo;em, and
      Josiah &lsquo;ll help when he gits back. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out for a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went down to the beach, climbed into a dory belonging to a neighbor,
      and Captain Jerry saw him row away in the direction of the cable station.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, after the dishes were washed and the table cleared, there
      came a knock at the door. Mrs. Snow opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for goodness sake! Mr. Hazeltine!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Come right in.
      What a stranger you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph entered, shook the snow, which had just begun to fall, from his hat
      and coat, took off these articles, in response to the hearty invitation of
      Captain Eri, and shook hands with all present. Elsie&rsquo;s face was an
      interesting study. Captain Jerry looked scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes&rsquo; talk, Captain Eri rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Snow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come upstairs a little while. I want to talk to you
      &lsquo;bout somethin&rsquo;. You come, too, Jerry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry looked from Elsie to the speaker, and then to Elsie again.
      But Captain Eri&rsquo;s hand was on his arm, and he rose and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie watched this wholesale desertion with amazement. Then the door
      opened again, and Captain Eri put in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elsie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I jest want to tell you that this is my doin&rsquo;s, not
      Jerry&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And the door shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsie faced the caller with astonishment written on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; she said icily, &ldquo;you may know what this means, but I
      don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked at her and answered solemnly, but with a twinkle in his eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can guess, Miss Preston. You see Captain Jerry paid Captain
      Eri a call this afternoon and, as a result, Captain Eri called upon me.
      Then, as a result of THAT, I&mdash;well, I came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady blushed furiously. &ldquo;What did Captain Eri tell you?&rdquo; she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what Captain Jerry told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you told Captain Jerry this morning concerning something that you
      told him before, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer to this. Miss Preston looked as if she had a mind to
      run out of the room, then as if she might cry, and finally as if she
      wanted to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I humbly apologize,&rdquo; said the electrician contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU apologize? For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my stupidity in believing that Captain Jerry was to be accepted
      seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were excusable, certainly. And now I must apologize; also for taking
      the Captain too seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we pair the apologies as they do the votes in the Senate. Then
      one will offset the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that isn&rsquo;t fair, for the blunder was all on my part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if we can&rsquo;t pair apologies, suppose we pair blunders. I don&rsquo;t
      accept your statement of guilt, mind, but since you are determined to
      shoulder it, we might put it on one side and on the other we&rsquo;ll put&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gusty&rsquo; Black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Captain Eri knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it safe for a feller to come in?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Elsie severely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether talebearers should be
      admitted or not, but if they do come they must beg pardon for interfering
      in other people&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and the Captain made a profound bow, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be so &lsquo;kind
      and condescendin&rsquo;, and stoop so low, and be so bendin&rsquo;&rsquo; as to forgive me.
      And, while I&rsquo;m &lsquo;bout it, I&rsquo;ll apologize for Jerry, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said the young lady decidedly. &ldquo;Captain Jerry must apologize
      for himself. Captain Jeremiah Burgess,&rdquo; she called up the stairway, &ldquo;come
      into court, and answer for your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Captain Jerry tremblingly came.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A &ldquo;NO&rsquo;THEASTER&rdquo; BLOWS
    </h3>
    <p>
      It had begun to snow early in the evening, a light fall at first, but
      growing heavier every minute, and, as the flakes fell thicker and faster,
      the wind began to blow, and its force increased steadily. Ralph, hearing
      the gusts as they swooped about the corners of the house, and the &ldquo;swish&rdquo;
       of the snow as it was thrown against the window panes, several times rose
      to go, but Captain Eri in each instance urged him to stay a little longer.
      Finally, the electrician rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to stay, Captain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how do you think I am
      going to get over to the station if this storm grows worse, as it seems to
      be doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; was the calm reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess yes. S&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to let you try to row over to the beach a
      night like this? It&rsquo;s darker &lsquo;n a nigger&rsquo;s pocket, and blowin&rsquo; and snowin&rsquo; 
      great guns besides. Jest you look out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, beckoned to Ralph, and then opened the outer door. He had to use
      considerable strength to do this, and a gust of wind and a small avalanche
      of snow roared in, and sent the lighter articles flying from the table.
      Elsie gave a little scream, and Mrs. Snow exclaimed, &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake,
      shut that door this minute! Everything &lsquo;ll be soppin&rsquo; wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain pulled the door shut again, and dropped the hook into the
      staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice night for a pull, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he observed, smiling. &ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;ve
      heard it comin&rsquo; on, and I made up my mind you&rsquo;d have to stay on dry land
      for a spell, no matter if all creation wanted you on t&rsquo;other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph looked troubled. &ldquo;I ought to be at the station,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so, but you ain&rsquo;t, and you&rsquo;ll have to put up at this boardin&rsquo; house
      till mornin&rsquo;. When it&rsquo;s daylight one of us &lsquo;ll set you across. Mr. Langley
      ain&rsquo;t foolish. He won&rsquo;t expect you to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Hazeltine,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, &ldquo;you might jest as well give
      it up fust as last. You KNOW you can&rsquo;t go over to that station jest as
      well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ralph did give it up, although rather against his will. There was
      nothing of importance to be done, but he felt a little like a deserter,
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perez won&rsquo;t git home neither,&rdquo; observed Captain Eri. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s snowed in,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez had that afternoon gone down to the Mayo homestead to take
      tea with Miss Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git home! I should think not!&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow decidedly. &ldquo;Pashy&rsquo;s got too
      much sense to let him try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Elsie,&rdquo; commented Captain Jerry, &ldquo;I told you we&rsquo;d have a
      no&rsquo;theaster &lsquo;fore the winter was over. I guess there&rsquo;ll be gale enough to
      satisfy you, now. No school to-morrer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s settled! Let&rsquo;s be comf&rsquo;table. Ain&rsquo;t there some of that cider
      down cellar? Where&rsquo;s the pitcher?&rdquo; And Captain Eri hurried off to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When bedtime came there was some argument as to where the guest should
      sleep. Ralph insisted that the haircloth sofa in the parlor was just the
      thing, but Captain Eri wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haircloth&rsquo;s all right to look at,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the slipperiest
      stuff that ever was, I cal&rsquo;late. Every time I set on a haircloth chair I
      feel&rsquo;s if I was draggin&rsquo; anchor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cot was declared ineligible, also, and the question was finally
      settled by Josiah and Captain Eri going upstairs to the room once occupied
      by John Baxter, while Ralph took that which they vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before he fell asleep. The gale seemed to be tearing
      loose the eternal foundations. The house shook and the bed trembled as if
      a great hand was moving them, and the snow slapped against the windows
      till it seemed that they must break.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning there was little change in the weather. The snow had turned
      to a sleet, half rain, that stuck to everything and coated it with ice.
      The wind was blowing as hard as ever. Captain Eri and Ralph, standing just
      outside the kitchen door, and in the lee of the barn, paused to watch the
      storm for a minute before they went down to the beach. At intervals they
      caught glimpses of the snow-covered roofs of the fish shanties, and the
      water of the inner bay, black and threatening and scarred with whitecaps;
      then another gust would come, and they could scarcely see the posts at the
      yard gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you want to go over, do you?&rdquo; asked the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do, if I can get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we can git there all right. I&rsquo;ve rowed a dory a good many times when
      &lsquo;twas as bad as this. This ain&rsquo;t no picnic day, though, that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; he
      added, as they crossed the yard, and caught the full force of the wind.
      &ldquo;Lucky you put on them ileskins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was arrayed in Captain Jerry&rsquo;s &ldquo;dirty-weather rig,&rdquo; and although, as
      Captain Eri said, the garments fitted him &ldquo;like a shirt on a handspike,&rdquo;
       they were very acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the dory covered with snow and half-full of slush, and it took
      some few minutes to get her into condition. When this was accomplished
      they hauled her down to the shore, and Captain Eri, standing knee-deep in
      water, steadied her while Ralph climbed in. Then the Captain tumbled in
      himself, picked up the oars, and settled down for the pull to the outer
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dory, as everyone acquainted alongshore knows, is the safest of all
      small craft for use in heavy weather. It is unsinkable for one thing, and,
      being flat-bottomed, slips over the waves instead of plowing through them.
      But the high freeboard is a mark for the wind, and to keep a straight
      course on such a morning as this requires skill, and no small amount of
      muscle. Ralph, seated in the stern, found himself wondering how on earth
      his companion managed to row as he did, and steer at the same time. The
      strokes were short, but there was power in them, and the dory, although
      moving rather slowly, went doggedly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take her,&rdquo; shouted Ralph after a while, &ldquo;you must be tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, me?&rdquo; Captain Eri laughed. &ldquo;I could keep this up for a week. There
      ain&rsquo;t any sea in here. If we was outside now, &lsquo;twould be diff&rsquo;rent,
      maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They hit the beach almost exactly at the right spot, a feat which the
      passenger considered a miracle, but which the Captain seemed to take as a
      matter of course. They beached and anchored the dory, and, bending almost
      double as they faced the wind, plowed through the sand to the back door of
      the station. There was comparatively little snow here on the outer beach&mdash;the
      gale had swept it nearly all away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Langley met them as they tramped into the hall. The old gentleman was
      glad to see his assistant, for he had begun to fear that the latter might
      have tried to row over during the evening, and met with disaster. As they
      sat round the stove in his room he said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any wrecks inside
      the beach. We shall have enough outside, I&rsquo;m afraid. I hear there is one
      schooner in trouble now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so?&rdquo; asked Captain Eri. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Hog&rsquo;s Back shoal, they think. One of the life-saving crew told
      McLaughlin that they saw her last night, when the gale first began, trying
      to make an offing, and that wreckage was coming ashore this morning.
      Captain Davis was going to try to reach her with the boat, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to be at the life-saving station when they land,&rdquo; said
      Ralph. &ldquo;It would be a new experience for me. I&rsquo;ve seen the crew drill
      often enough, but I have never seen them actually at work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say if we go down to the station?&rdquo; asked the Captain. &ldquo;That
      is, if Mr. Langley here can spare you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can spare him,&rdquo; said the superintendent. &ldquo;There is nothing of
      importance to be done here just now. But it will be a terrible walk down
      the beach this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wind &lsquo;ll be at our backs, and we&rsquo;re rigged for it, too. What d&rsquo;you say,
      Mr. Hazeltine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was only too glad of the opportunity to see, at least, the finish of
      a rescuing expedition, and he said so. So they got into the oilskins
      again, pulled their &ldquo;sou&rsquo;westers&rdquo; down over their ears, and started on the
      tramp to the life-saving station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electrician is not likely to forget that walk. The wind was, as the
      Captain said, at their backs, but it whistled in from the sea with
      terrific strength, and carried the sleet with it. It deluged them with
      water, and plastered them with flying seaweed and ice. The wet sand came
      in showers like hail, and beat against their shoulders until they felt the
      sting, even through their clothes. Toward the bay was nothing but gray
      mist, streaked with rain and sleet; toward the sea was the same mist,
      flying with the wind over such a huddle of tossing green and white as
      Ralph had never seen. The surf poured in in rollers that leaped over each
      other&rsquo;s humped backs in their savage energy to get at the shore, which
      trembled as they beat upon it. The ripples from one wave had not time to
      flow back before those of the next came threshing in. Great blobs of foam
      shot down the strand like wild birds, and the gurgle and splash and roar
      were terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked as near the water line as they dared, because the sand was
      harder there. Captain Eri went ahead, hands in his pockets and head down.
      Ralph followed, sometimes watching his companion, but oftener gazing at
      the sea. At intervals there would be a lull, as if the storm giant had
      paused for breath, and they could see for half a mile over the crazy
      water; then the next gust would pull the curtain down again, and a whirl
      of rain and sleet would shut them in. Conversation meant only a series of
      shrieks and they gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Captain turned, grinned pleasantly, while the rain drops
      splashed on his nose, and waved one arm. Ralph looked and saw ahead of
      them the clustered buildings of the life-saving station. And he was glad
      to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; puffed Captain Eri as they opened the door. &ldquo;Nice mornin&rsquo; for
      ducks. Hey, Luther!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;wake up here; you&rsquo;ve got callers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard footsteps in the next room, the door opened, and in came&mdash;not
      Luther Davis, but Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eri!&rdquo; he exclaimed amazedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake, Perez! What are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are YOU doin&rsquo; here, I should say. How d&rsquo;you do, Mr. Hazeltine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri pushed back his &ldquo;sou&rsquo;wester,&rdquo; and strolled over to the stove.
      Ralph followed suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Perez,&rdquo; said the former, extending his hands over the fire, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      easy enough to tell you why we&rsquo;re here. We heard there was a wreck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is. She&rsquo;s a schooner, and she&rsquo;s off there on the Hog&rsquo;s Back. Luther
      and the crew put off to her more &lsquo;n two hours ago, and I&rsquo;m gittin&rsquo; 
      worried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Perez went on to explain that, because of the storm, he had been
      persuaded to stay at Mrs. Mayo&rsquo;s all night; that Captain Davis had been
      over for a moment that evening on an errand, and had said that the
      schooner had been sighted and that, as the northeaster was coming on, she
      was almost certain to get into trouble; that he, Perez, had rowed over the
      first thing in the morning to get the news, and had been just in time to
      see the launching of the lifeboat, as the crew put off to the schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to worry &lsquo;bout,&rdquo; observed Captain Eri. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
      slouch of a pull off to the Hog&rsquo;s Back this weather, and besides, I&rsquo;d
      trust Lute Davis anywhere on salt water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied the unconvinced Captain Perez, &ldquo;but he ought to
      have been back afore this. There was a kind of let-up in the storm jest
      afore I got here, and they see her fast on the shoal with the crew in the
      riggin&rsquo;. Luther took the small boat &lsquo;cause he thought he could handle her
      better, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; me; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid she&rsquo;s overloaded. I was
      jest thinkin&rsquo; of goin&rsquo; out on the p&rsquo;int to see if I could see anything of
      &lsquo;em when you folks come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go ahead. We&rsquo;ll go with you, if Mr. Hazeltine&rsquo;s got any of the
      chill out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was feeling warm by this time and, after Perez had put on his coat
      and hat, they went out once more into the gale. The point of which Perez
      had spoken was a wedge-shaped sand ridge that, thrown up by the waves and
      tide, thrust itself out from the beach some few hundred yards below the
      station. They reached its tip, and stood there in the very midst of the
      storm, waiting for the lulls, now more frequent, and scanning the tumbling
      water for the returning lifeboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schooner&rsquo;s layin&rsquo; right over there,&rdquo; shouted Captain Perez in Ralph&rsquo;s
      ear, pointing off into the mist. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout a mile off shore, I cal&rsquo;late.
      Wicked place, the Hog&rsquo;s Back is, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s lettin&rsquo; up a little mite,&rdquo; bellowed Captain Eri. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had the
      wust of it, I guess. There ain&rsquo;t so much&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. The curtain of sleet parted, leaving a
      quarter-mile-long lane, through which they could see the frothing ridges
      racing one after the other, endlessly. And across this lane, silent and
      swift, like a moving picture on a screen, drifted a white turtleback with
      black dots clinging to it. It was in sight not more than a half minute,
      then the lane closed again, as the rain lashed their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez gasped, and clutched the electrician by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey mighty!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; shouted Ralph. &ldquo;What was it, Captain Eri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Eri did not answer. He had turned, and was running at full
      speed back to the beach. When they came up they found him straining at the
      side of the dory that Luther Davis used in tending his lobster pots. The
      boat, turned bottom up, lay high above tide mark in the little cove behind
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, now!&rdquo; shouted the Captain, in a tone Ralph had never heard him use
      before. &ldquo;Over with her! Lively!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed him without question. As the dory settled right side up two
      heavy oars, that had been secured by being thrust under the seats, fell
      back with a clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Captain?&rdquo; shouted Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lifeboat upset. How many did you make out hangin&rsquo; onto her, Perez?
      Five, seemed to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, I thought. Eri, you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to try to reach her with this dory?
      You couldn&rsquo;t do it. You&rsquo;ll only be drownded yourself. My Lord!&rdquo; he moaned,
      wringing his hands, &ldquo;what &lsquo;ll Pashy do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch a-holt now,&rdquo; commanded Captain Eri. &ldquo;Down to the shore with her!
      Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dragged the dory to the water&rsquo;s edge with one rush. Then Eri
      hurriedly thrust in the tholepins. Perez protested again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t no use. She won&rsquo;t live to git through the
      breakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend answered without looking up. &ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to let Lute Davis and them other fellers drown without makin&rsquo; a
      try for &lsquo;em? Push off when I tell you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you let me go instead of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk foolish. You&rsquo;ve got Pashy to look after. Ready now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ralph Hazeltine intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going myself,&rdquo; he said firmly, putting one foot over the gunwale.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a younger man than either of you, and I&rsquo;m used to a boat. I mean it.
      I&rsquo;m, going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri looked at the electrician&rsquo;s face; he saw nothing but
      determination there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine, run as fast as the Lord
      &lsquo;ll let you back to the station and git another set of oars. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without answering, the young man sprang up the beach and ran toward the
      buildings. The moment that he was inside Captain Eri leaped into the dory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push off, Perez!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;That young feller&rsquo;s got a life to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go without me,&rdquo; asserted Perez stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Push off, and then jump in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Perez attempted to obey. He waded into the water and gave the dory
      a push, but, just as he was about to scramble in, he received a shove that
      sent him backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your job&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; care of Pashy!&rdquo; roared Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perez scrambled to his feet, but the dory was already half-way across the
      little patch of comparatively smooth water in the cove. As he looked he
      saw it enter the first line of breakers, rise amid a shower of foam, poise
      on the crest, and slip over. The second line of roaring waves came surging
      on, higher and more threatening than the first. Captain Eri glanced over
      his shoulder, turned the dory&rsquo;s bow toward them and waited. They broke,
      and, as they did so, the boat shot forward into the whirlpool of froth.
      Then the sleet came pouring down and shut everything from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ralph came hurrying to the beach, bearing the oars, he found Captain
      Perez alone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ERI GOES BACK ON A FRIEND
    </h3>
    <p>
      Captain Eri knew that the hardest and most dangerous portion of his
      perilous trip was just at its beginning. If the dory got through the surf
      without capsizing, it was an even bet that she would stay right-side-up
      for a while longer, at any rate. So he pulled out of the little cove, and
      pointed the boat&rsquo;s bow toward the thundering smother of white, his
      shoulders squared, his hands tightened on the oar handles, and his
      under-jaw pushed out beyond the upper. Old foremast hands, those who had
      sailed with the Captain on his coasting voyages, would, had they seen
      these signs, have prophesied trouble for someone. They were Captain Eri&rsquo;s
      battle-flags, and just now his opponent was the gray Atlantic. If the
      latter won, it would only be after a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first wave tripped over the bar and whirled beneath him, sending the
      dory high into the air and splashing its occupant with spray. The Captain
      held the boat stationary, waiting for the second to break, and then, half
      rising, put all his weight and strength on the oars. The struggle had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      They used to say on board the Hannah M. that the skipper never got
      rattled. The same cool head and steady nerve that Josiah had admired when
      the catboat threaded the breakers at the entrance of the bay, now served
      the same purpose in this more tangled and infinitely more wicked maze. The
      dory climbed and ducked, rolled and slid, but gained, inch by inch, foot
      by foot. The advancing waves struck savage blows at the bow, the wind did
      its best to swing her broadside on, but there was one hundred and eighty
      pounds of clear grit and muscle tugging at the oars, and, though the
      muscles were not as young as they had been, there were years of experience
      to make every pound count. At last the preliminary round was over. The
      boat sprang clear of the breakers and crept out farther and farther, with
      six inches of water slopping in her bottom, but afloat and seaworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until she was far into deep water that the Captain turned her
      bow down the shore. When this was done, it was on the instant, and,
      although a little more water came inboard, there was not enough to be
      dangerous. Then, with the gale astern and the tide to help, Captain Eri
      made the dory go as she, or any other on that coast, had never gone
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain knew that the wind and the tide that were now aiding him were
      also sweeping the overturned lifeboat along at a rapid rate. He must come
      up with it before it reached the next shoal. He must reach it before the
      waves, and, worse than all, the cold had caused the poor fellows clinging
      to it for life to loose their grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dory jumped from crest to crest like a hurdler. The sleet now beat
      directly into the Captain&rsquo;s face and froze on his eyebrows and lashes, but
      he dared not draw in an oar to free a hand. The wind caught up the
      spindrift and poured it over him in icy baths, but he was too warm from
      the furious exercise to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the lulls he turned his head and gazed over the sea, looking for the
      boat. Once he saw it, before the storm shut down again, and he groaned
      aloud to count but two black dots on its white surface. He pulled harder
      than ever, and grunted with every stroke, while the perspiration poured
      down his forehead and froze when it reached the ice dams over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it was in plain sight, and the two dots, now clearly human beings,
      were still there. He pointed the bow straight at it and rowed on. When he
      looked again there was but one, a figure sprawled along the keel, clinging
      to the centerboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flying dory bore down upon the lifeboat, and the Captain risked what
      little breath he had in a hail. The clinging figure raised its head, and
      Captain Eri felt an almost selfish sense of relief to see that it was
      Luther Davis. If it had to be but one, he would rather it was that one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom of the lifeboat rose like a dome from the sea that beat and
      roared over and around it. The centerboard had floated up and projected at
      the top, and it was about this that Captain Davis&rsquo; arms were clasped.
      Captain Eri shot the dory alongside, pulled in one oar, and the two boats
      fitted closely together. Then Eri reached out, and, seizing his friend by
      the belt round his waist, pulled him from his hold. Davis fell into the
      bottom of the dory, only half conscious and entirely helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri lifted him so that his head and shoulders rested on a thwart,
      and then, setting his oar against the lifeboat&rsquo;s side, pushed the dory
      clear. Then he began rowing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far he had been more successful than he had reason to expect, but the
      task that he must now accomplish was not less difficult. He must reach the
      shore safely, and with another life beside his own to guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was out of the question to attempt to get back to the cove; the landing
      must be made on the open beach, and, although Captain Eri had more than
      once brought a dory safely through a high surf, he had never attempted it
      when his boat had nearly a foot of water in her and carried a helpless
      passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, still running before the wind, the Captain edged in
      toward the shore. Luther Davis moved once or twice, but said nothing. His
      oilskins were frozen stiff and his beard was a lump of ice. Captain Eri
      began to fear that he might die from cold and exhaustion before the
      attempt at landing was made. The Captain resolved to wait no longer, but
      to take the risk of running directly for the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was near enough now to see the leaping spray of the breakers, and their
      bellow sounded louder than the howl of the wind or the noises of the sea
      about him. He bent forward and shouted in the ear of the prostrate
      life-saver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luther!&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;Lute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Davis&rsquo; head rolled back, his eyes opened, and, in a dazed way, he
      looked at the figure swinging back and forth with the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lute!&rdquo; shouted Captain Eri, &ldquo;listen to me! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to try to land.
      D&rsquo;you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Davis&rsquo; thoughts seemed to be gathering slowly. He was, ordinarily, a man
      of strong physique, courageous, and a fighter every inch of him, but his
      strength had been beaten out by the waves and chilled by the cold, and the
      sight of the men with whom he had lived and worked for years drowning one
      by one, had broken his nerve. He looked at his friend, and then at the
      waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he said feebly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all gone. I might as well go,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri&rsquo;s eyes snapped. &ldquo;Lute Davis,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I never thought
      I&rsquo;d see you playin&rsquo; crybaby. Brace up! What are you, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The half-frozen man made a plucky effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Eri,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, but I ain&rsquo;t much good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you stand up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little by little he raised himself to his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout as fur&rsquo;s I can go, Eri,&rdquo; he said, between his teeth. &ldquo;You look out
      for yourself. I&rsquo;ll do my durndest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dory was caught by the first of the great waves, and, on its crest,
      went flying toward the beach. Captain Eri steered it with the oars as well
      as he could. The wave broke, and the half-filled boat paused, was caught
      up by the succeeding breaker, and thrown forward again. The Captain, still
      trying to steer with one oar, let go of the other, and seizing his
      companion by the belt, pulled him to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;stand by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat poised on the curling wave, went down like a hammer, struck the
      sand, and was buried in water. Just as it struck, Captain Eri jumped as
      far shoreward as he could. Davis sprang with him, but it was really the
      Captain&rsquo;s strength that carried them clear of the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept their feet for an instant, but, in that instant, Captain Eri
      dragged his friend a yard or so up the shelving beach. Then they were
      knocked flat by the next wave. The Captain dug his toes into the sand and
      braced himself as the undertow sucked back. Once more he rose and they
      staggered on again, only to go down when the next rush of water came.
      Three times this performance was repeated, and, as they rose for the
      fourth time, the Captain roared, &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another plunge, a splashing run, and they were on the hard sand of the
      beach. Then they both tumbled on their faces and breathed in great gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain realized that this would not do, for, in their soaked
      condition, freezing to death was a matter of but a short time. He seized
      Davis by the shoulder and shook him again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Lute! Come on!&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Git up! You&rsquo;ve GOT to git up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, after a while, the life-saver did get up, although he could scarcely
      stand. Then, with the Captain&rsquo;s arm around his waist, they started slowly
      up the beach toward the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had gone but a little way when they were met by Ralph Hazeltine and
      Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow had been, for her, rather nervous all that forenoon. She
      performed her household duties as thoroughly as usual, but Elsie, to whom
      the storm had brought a holiday, noticed that she looked out of the window
      and at the clock frequently. Once she even went so far as to tell the
      young lady that she felt &ldquo;kind of queer; jest as if somethin&rsquo; was goin&rsquo; to
      happen.&rdquo; As the housekeeper was not the kind to be troubled with
      presentiments, Elsie was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was on the table at twelve o&rsquo;clock, but Captain Eri was not there
      to help eat it, and they sat down without him. And here again Mrs. Snow
      departed from her regular habit, for she ate little and was very quiet.
      She was the first to hear an unusual sound outside, and, jumping up, ran
      to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s drivin&rsquo; into the yard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who on airth would be
      comin&rsquo; here such a day as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry joined her at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Abner Mayo&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Perez comin&rsquo; home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not Captain Perez, but Mr. Mayo himself, as they saw when the
      rubber blanket fastened across the front of the buggy was dropped and the
      driver sprang out. Mrs. Snow opened the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Abner!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Jerry, as the newcomer stopped to knock
      the snow from his boots before coming in, &ldquo;what have you done to Perez?
      Goin&rsquo; to keep him for a steady boarder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Mayo had important news to communicate, and he did not intend to
      lose the effect of his sensation by springing it without due preparation.
      He took off his hat and mittens and solemnly declined a proffered chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Burgess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to tell you&mdash;somethin&rsquo; 
      awful. The whole life-savin&rsquo; crew but one is drownded, and Cap&rsquo;n Eri Hedge&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation from Mrs. Snow interrupted him. The housekeeper clasped her
      hands together tightly and sank into a chair. She was very white. Elsie
      ran to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Mrs. Snow?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;! Go on, Mr. Mayo. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bearer of ill-tidings, gratified at the result of his first attempt,
      proceeded deliberately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Cap&rsquo;n Hedge and Luther Davis are over at the station pretty nigh
      dead. If it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for the Cap&rsquo;n, Luther&rsquo;d have gone, too. Eri took a dory
      and went off and picked him up. Perez come over to my house and told us
      about it, and Pashy&rsquo;s gone back with him to see to her brother. I didn&rsquo;t
      go down to the store this mornin&rsquo;, &lsquo;twas stormin&rsquo; so, but as soon as I
      heard I harnessed up to come and tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in answer to the hurried questions of Captain Jerry and Elsie, Mr.
      Mayo told the whole story as far as he knew it. Mrs. Snow said nothing,
      but sat with her hands still clasped in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luther is ha&rsquo;f drownded and froze,&rdquo; concluded Abner, &ldquo;and the Cap&rsquo;n got a
      bang with an oar when they jumped out of the dory that, Perez is afraid,
      broke his arm. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; right back to git Dr. Palmer. They tried to
      telephone him, but the wire&rsquo;s down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear! dear! dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Jerry, completely demoralized by the
      news. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s dreadful! I must go right down there, mustn&rsquo;t I? The poor
      fellers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow rose to her feet quietly, but with a determined air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; right back soon&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve got the Doctor, Mr. Mayo?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. I ain&rsquo;t been to my store this mornin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid
      I ought to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be frank, Abner was too great a sensation lover to forfeit the
      opportunity of springing his startling news on the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Josiah, you&rsquo;ll have to harness Dan&rsquo;l and take me down. I mustn&rsquo;t
      wait another minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Snow!&rdquo; expostulated Captain Jerry, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t go down there.
      The Doctor&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll go, and Pashy&rsquo;s there already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the housekeeper merely waved him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to stay here with Elsie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; how
      long I may be gone. Josiah &lsquo;ll drive me down, won&rsquo;t you, Josiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no lack of enthusiasm in the &ldquo;able seaman&rsquo;s&rdquo; answer. The boy was
      only too glad of the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t fit weather for you to be out in. You&rsquo;ll git soakin&rsquo; wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess if Pashy Davis can stand it, I can. Elsie, will you come and help
      me git ready, while Josiah&rsquo;s harnessin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the chamber above, Elsie was thunderstruck to see her
      companion seat herself in the rocker and cover her face with her hands. If
      it had been anyone else it would not have been so astonishing, but the
      cool, self-possessed housekeeper&mdash;she could scarcely believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Snow!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what IS it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady from Nantucket hastily rose and wiped her eyes with her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she answered, with an attempt at a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind of
      fidgety this mornin&rsquo;, and the way that man started off to tell his yarn
      upset me; that&rsquo;s all. I mustn&rsquo;t be such a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set about getting ready with a vim and attention to detail that proved
      that her &ldquo;fidgets&rdquo; had not affected her common-sense. She was pale and her
      hands trembled a little, but she took a covered basket and packed in it
      cloth for bandages, a hot-water bottle, mustard, a bottle of liniment, and
      numerous other things likely to be of use. Last of all, she added a bottle
      of whisky that had been prescribed as a stimulant for John Baxter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose some folks would think &lsquo;twas terrible carryin&rsquo; this with me,&rdquo;
       she observed. &ldquo;A woman pitched into me once for givin&rsquo; it to her husband
      when he was sick. I told her I didn&rsquo;t favor RHUBARB as a steady drink, but
      I hoped I knew enough to give it when &lsquo;twas necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph and Captain Perez were surprised men when the housekeeper, dripping,
      but cheerful, appeared on the scene. She and Josiah had had a stormy
      passage on the way down, for the easy-going Daniel had objected to being
      asked to trot through drifts, and Mrs. Snow had insisted that he should be
      made to do it. The ford was out of the question, so they stalled the old
      horse in the Mayo barn and borrowed Abner&rsquo;s dory to make the crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow took charge at once of the tired men, and the overtaxed Miss
      Patience was glad enough to have her do it. Luther Davis was in bed, and
      Captain Eri, after an hour&rsquo;s sojourn in the same snug harbor, had utterly
      refused to stay there longer, and now, dressed in a suit belonging to the
      commandant, was stretched upon a sofa in the front room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was the most surprised of all when Mrs. Snow appeared. He
      fairly gasped when she first entered the room, and seemed to be struck
      speechless, for he said scarcely a word while she dosed him with hot
      drinks, rubbed his shoulder&mdash;the bone was not broken, but there was a
      bruise there as big as a saucer&mdash;with the liniment, and made him
      generally comfortable. He watched her every movement with a sort of
      worshipful wonder, and seemed to be thinking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Davis, although feeling a little better, was still very weak, and
      his sister and Captain Perez were with him. Josiah soon returned to the
      Mayo homestead to act as ferryman for Dr. Palmer when the latter should
      arrive, and Ralph, finding that there was nothing more that he could do,
      went back to the cable station. The storm had abated somewhat and the wind
      had gone down. Captain Eri and Mrs. Snow were alone in the front room,
      and, for the first time since she entered the house, the lady from
      Nantucket sat down to rest. Then the Captain spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Snow,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve changed your clothes
      sence you got here. You must have been soaked through, too. I wish you
      wouldn&rsquo;t take such risks. You hadn&rsquo;t ought to have come over here a day
      like this, anyway. Not but what the Lord knows it&rsquo;s good to have you
      here,&rdquo; he added hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper seemed surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Eri,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I b&rsquo;lieve if you was dyin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d worry for fear
      somebody else wouldn&rsquo;t be comf&rsquo;table while you was doing it. &lsquo;Twould be
      pretty hard for me to change my clothes,&rdquo; she added, with a laugh, &ldquo;seein&rsquo; 
      that there probably ain&rsquo;t anything but men&rsquo;s clothes in the place.&rdquo; Then,
      with a sigh, &ldquo;Poor fellers, they won&rsquo;t need &lsquo;em any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. And they were all alive and hearty this mornin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s an awful
      thing for Luther. Has he told anything yit &lsquo;bout how it come to happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little. The schooner was from Maine, bound to New York. Besides
      her own crew she had some Italians aboard, coal-handlers, they was, goin&rsquo; 
      over on a job for the owner. Cap&rsquo;n Davis says he saw right away that the
      lifeboat would be overloaded, but he had to take &lsquo;em all, there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      time for a second trip. He made the schooner&rsquo;s crew and the others lay
      down in the boat where they wouldn&rsquo;t hinder the men at the oars, but when
      they got jest at the tail of the shoal, where the sea was heaviest, them
      Italians lost their heads and commenced to stand up and yell, and fust
      thing you know, she swung broadside on and capsized. Pashy says Luther
      don&rsquo;t say much more, but she jedges, from what he does say, that some of
      the men hung on with him for a while, but was washed off and drownded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; there was four or five there when we saw her fust. &lsquo;Twas
      Lute&rsquo;s grip on the centerboard that saved him. It&rsquo;s an awful thing&mdash;awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he would have gone, too, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you. And you talk
      about MY takin&rsquo; risks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jerry hadn&rsquo;t ought to have let you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LET me come! I should like to have seen him try to stop me. The idea!
      Where would I be if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t helpin&rsquo; you, after all you&rsquo;ve done for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;VE done? I haven&rsquo;t done anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made me happier &lsquo;n I&rsquo;ve been for years. You&rsquo;ve been so kind that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s been kind,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made a home for me;
      somethin&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t had afore sence I was a boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow went on as if he had not spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that you might have been drownded the same as the rest,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I knew somethin&rsquo; was happenin&rsquo;. I jest felt it, somehow. I told
      Elsie I was sure of it. I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything but you all the
      forenoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain sat up on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marthy,&rdquo; he said in an awed tone, &ldquo;do you know what I was thinkin&rsquo; of
      when I was pullin&rsquo; through the wust of it this mornin&rsquo;? I was thinkin&rsquo; of
      you. I thought of Luther and the rest of them poor souls, of course, but I
      thought of you most of the time. It kept comin&rsquo; back to me that if I went
      under I shouldn&rsquo;t see you ag&rsquo;in. And you was thinkin&rsquo; of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when that Mayo man said he had awful news, I felt sure &lsquo;twas you he
      was goin&rsquo; to tell about. I never fainted away in my life that I know of,
      but I think I &lsquo;most fainted then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you cared as much as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow both were speaking quietly, but as if it was useless longer to
      keep back anything. To speak the exact truth without reserve seemed the
      most natural thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; said the Captain reverently, and still in the same low
      tone. &ldquo;I said once afore that I b&rsquo;lieved you was sent here, and now I&rsquo;m
      sure of it. It seems almost as if you was sent to ME, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper still looked out of the window, but she answered simply,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, it does so. Marthy, we&rsquo;ve been happy together while you&rsquo;ve been
      here. Do you b&rsquo;lieve you could be happy with me always&mdash;if you
      married me, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow turned and looked at him. There were tears in her eyes, but she
      did not wipe them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think now, Marthy. I ain&rsquo;t very young, and I ain&rsquo;t very rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I?&rdquo; with a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you really think you could be happy if you was the wife of an old
      codger like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The answer was short, but it was convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eri rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he said in a sort of unbelieving whisper. &ldquo;Marthy, are you willin&rsquo; 
      to try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again Mrs. Snow said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Palmer came he found Luther Davis still in bed, but Captain Eri
      was up and dressed, and there was such a quiet air of happiness about him
      that the man of medicine was amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, man!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I expected to find you flat on your back,
      and you look better than I&rsquo;ve seen you for years. Taking a salt-water bath
      in mid-winter must agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so much that,&rdquo; replied the Captain serenely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pay I got
      for takin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Doctor saw Perez alone, he asked the latter to keep a close watch
      on Captain Eri&rsquo;s behavior. He said he was afraid that the exertion and
      exposure might have affected the Captain&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perez, alarmed by this caution, did watch his friend very closely, but he
      saw nothing to frighten him until, as they were about to start for home,
      Captain Eri suddenly struck his thigh a resounding slap
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; he groaned distressfully. &ldquo;I clean forgot. I&rsquo;ve gone back on
      Jerry!&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;DIME-SHOW BUS&rsquo;NESS&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Elsie and Captain Jerry were kept busy that afternoon. Abner Mayo&rsquo;s news
      spread quickly, and people gathered at the post-office, the stores, and
      the billiard room to discuss it. Some of the men, notably &ldquo;Cy&rdquo; Warner and
      &ldquo;Rufe&rdquo; Smith, local representatives of the big Boston dailies, hurried off
      to the life-saving station to get the facts at first hand. Others came
      down to talk with Captain Jerry and Elsie. Melissa Busteed&rsquo;s shawl was on
      her shoulders and her &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; was tied about her head in less than two
      minutes after her next-door neighbor shouted the story across the back
      yards. She had just left the house, and Captain Jerry was delivering a
      sarcastic speech concerning &ldquo;talkin&rsquo; machines,&rdquo; when Daniel plodded
      through the gate, drawing the buggy containing Josiah, Mrs. Snow, and
      Captain Eri.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a man who had been described as &ldquo;half-dead,&rdquo; Captain Eri looked very
      well, indeed. Jerry ran to help him from the carriage, but he jumped out
      himself and then assisted the housekeeper to alight with an air of proud
      proprietorship. He was welcomed to the house like a returned prodigal, and
      Captain Jerry shook his well hand until the arm belonging to it seemed
      likely to become as stiff and sore as the other. While this handshaking
      was going on Captain Eri was embarrassed. He did not look his friend in
      the face, and most of his conversation was addressed to Elsie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had warmed his hands and told the story of the wreck and
      rescue, he said, &ldquo;Jerry, come up to my room a minute, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve got
      somethin&rsquo; I want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely wondering what the private conversation might be, Jerry followed
      his friend upstairs. When they were in the room, Captain Eri closed the
      door and faced his companion. He was confused, and stammered a little, as
      he said, &ldquo;Jerry, I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to say to you &lsquo;bout Mrs.
      Snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it was Captain Jerry&rsquo;s turn to be confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Eri,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t fair to keep pesterin&rsquo; me like this. I
      know I ain&rsquo;t said nothin&rsquo; to her yit, but I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to. I had a week,
      anyhow, and it ain&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;f over. Land sake!&rdquo; he burst forth, &ldquo;d&rsquo;you s&rsquo;pose
      I ain&rsquo;t been thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it? I ain&rsquo;t thought of nothin&rsquo; else, hardly. I
      bet you I&rsquo;ve been over the whole thing every night sence we had that talk.
      I go over it and GO over it. I&rsquo;ve thought of more &lsquo;n a million ways to ask
      her, but there ain&rsquo;t one of &lsquo;em that suits me. If I was goin&rsquo; to be hung
      &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be no worse, and now you&rsquo;ve got to keep a-naggin&rsquo;. Let me alone
      till my time is up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t naggin&rsquo;. I was jest goin&rsquo; to tell you that you won&rsquo;t have to
      ask. I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; to her myself, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifice sprang out of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri Hedge!&rdquo; he exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;I thought you was a friend of
      mine! I give you my word I&rsquo;d do it in a week, and the least you could have
      done, seems to me, would have been to wait and give me the chance. But no!
      all you think &lsquo;bout&rsquo;s yourself. So &lsquo;fraid she&rsquo;d say no and you&rsquo;d lose your
      old housekeeper, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you? The idea! She must think I&rsquo;m a good one&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      do my own courtin&rsquo;, and have to git somebody to do it for me! What did she
      say?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said yes to what I asked her,&rdquo; was the reply with a half smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Captain Jerry&rsquo;s face settled the look of one who accepts the
      melancholy inevitable. He sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;posed she would,&rdquo; he said with a sigh. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s known me for quite a
      spell now, and she&rsquo;s had a chance to see what kind of a man I be. Well,
      what else did you do? Ain&rsquo;t settled the weddin&rsquo; day, have you?&rdquo; This with
      marked sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yit. Jerry, you&rsquo;ve made a mistake. I didn&rsquo;t ask her for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ask her&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;What are you talkin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked her for myself. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry was too much astonished even to get up. Instead, he simply
      sat still with open mouth while his friend continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to think a lot of Mrs. Snow sence she&rsquo;s been here,&rdquo; Captain Eri
      said slowly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve found out that she&rsquo;s felt the same way &lsquo;bout me.
      I&rsquo;ve kept still and said nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;cause I thought you ought to have the
      fust chance and, besides, I didn&rsquo;t know how she felt. But to-day, while we
      was talkin&rsquo;, it all come out of itself, seems so, and&mdash;well, we&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sacrifice&mdash;a sacrifice no longer&mdash;still sat silent, but
      curious changes of expression were passing over his face. Surprise,
      amazement, relief, and now a sort of grieved resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel small enough &lsquo;bout the way I&rsquo;ve treated you, Jerry,&rdquo; continued
      Captain Eri. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;but there! it&rsquo;s done, and all I can
      do is say I&rsquo;m sorry and that I meant to give you your chance. I shan&rsquo;t
      blame you if you git mad, not a bit; but I hope you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Jerry sighed. When he spoke it was in a tone of sublime
      forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t mad. I won&rsquo;t say my feelin&rsquo;s ain&rsquo;t hurt, &lsquo;cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause&mdash;well,
      never mind. If a wife and a home ain&rsquo;t for me, why I ought to be glad that
      you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to have &lsquo;em. I wish you both luck and a good v&rsquo;yage. Now,
      don&rsquo;t talk to me for a few minutes. Let me git sort of used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they shook hands and Captain Eri, with a troubled look at his friend,
      went out. After he had gone, Captain Jerry got up and danced three steps
      of an improvised jig, his face one broad grin. Then, with an effort, he
      sobered down, assumed an air of due solemnity, and tramped downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the announcement of Captain Perez&rsquo; engagement caused no surprise, that
      of Captain Eri&rsquo;s certainly did&mdash;surprise and congratulation on the
      part of those let into the secret, for it was decided to say nothing to
      outsiders as yet. Ralph came over that evening and they told him about it,
      and he was as pleased as the rest. As for the Captain, he was only too
      willing to shake hands with any and everybody, although he insisted that
      the housekeeper had nothing to be congratulated upon, and that she was
      &ldquo;takin&rsquo; big chances.&rdquo; The lady herself merely smiled at this, and quietly
      said that she was willing to take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm had wrecked every wire and stalled every train, and Orham was
      isolated for two days. Then communication was established once more, and
      the Boston dailies received the news of the loss of the life-savers and
      the crew of the schooner. And they made the most of it; sensational items
      were scarce just then, and the editors welcomed this one. The big black
      headlines spread halfway across the front pages. There were pictures of
      the wreck, &ldquo;drawn by our artist from description,&rdquo; and there were
      &ldquo;descriptions&rdquo; of all kinds. Special reporters arrived in the village and
      interviewed everyone they could lay hands on. Abner Mayo felt that for
      once he was receiving the attention he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life-saving station and the house by the shore were besieged by
      photographers and newspaper men. Captain Eri indignantly refused to pose
      for his photograph, so he was &ldquo;snapped&rdquo; as he went out to the barn, and
      had the pleasure of seeing a likeness of himself, somewhat out of focus,
      and with one leg stiffly elevated, in the Sunday Blanket. The reporters
      waylaid him at the post-office, or at his fish shanty, and begged for
      interviews. They got them, brief and pointedly personal, and, though these
      were not printed, columns describing him as &ldquo;a bluff, big-hearted hero,&rdquo;
       were.
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever a man was mad and disgusted, that man was the Captain. In the
      first place, as he said, what he had done was nothing more than any other
      man &lsquo;longshore would have done, and, secondly, it was nobody&rsquo;s business.
      Then again, he said, and with truth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This whole fuss makes me sick. Here&rsquo;s them fellers in the crew been goin&rsquo; 
      out, season after season, takin&rsquo; folks off wrecks, and the fool papers
      never say nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout it; but they go out this time, and don&rsquo;t save
      nobody and git drownded themselves, and they&rsquo;re heroes of a sudden. I hear
      they&rsquo;re raisin&rsquo; money up to Boston to give to the widders and orphans.
      Well, that&rsquo;s all right, but they&rsquo;d better keep on and git the Gov&rsquo;ment to
      raise the sal&rsquo;ries of them that&rsquo;s left in the service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The climax came when a flashily dressed stranger called, and insisted upon
      seeing the Captain alone. The interview lasted just about three minutes.
      When Mrs. Snow, alarmed by the commotion, rushed into the room, she found
      Captain Eri in the act of throwing after the fleeing stranger the shiny
      silk hat that the latter had left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that&mdash;that swab wanted?&rdquo; hotly demanded the
      indignant Captain. &ldquo;He wanted me to rig up in ileskins and a sou&rsquo;wester
      and show myself in dime museums. Said he&rsquo;d buy that dory of Luther&rsquo;s that
      I went out in, and show that &lsquo;long with me. I told him that dory was
      spread up and down the beach from here to Setuckit, but he said that
      didn&rsquo;t make no diff&rsquo;rence, he&rsquo;d have a dory there and say &lsquo;twas the reel
      one. Offered me a hundred dollars a week, the skate! I&rsquo;d give ten dollars
      right now to tell him the rest of what I had to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this the Captain went fishing every day, and when at home refused to
      see anybody not known personally. But the agitation went on, for the
      papers fed the flames, and in Boston they were raising a purse to buy gold
      watches and medals for him and for Captain Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after four o&rsquo;clock one afternoon of the week following that of the
      wreck, Captain Eri ventured to walk up to the village, keeping a weather
      eye out for reporters and smoking his pipe. He made several stops, one of
      them being at the schoolhouse where Josiah, now back at his desk, was
      studying overtime to catch up with his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Captain was strolling along, someone touched him from behind, and
      he turned to face Ralph Hazeltine. The electrician had been a pretty
      regular caller at the house of late, but Captain Eri had seen but little
      of him, for reasons unnecessary to state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Captain!&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;Taking a constitutional? You want to look
      out for Warner; I hear he&rsquo;s after you for another rescue &lsquo;special.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll need somebody to rescue him if he comes pesterin&rsquo; &lsquo;round me,&rdquo; was
      the reply. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t seen my dime show friend nowheres, have you? I&rsquo;d
      sort of like to meet HIM again; our other talk broke off kind of sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed, and said he was afraid that the museum manager wouldn&rsquo;t
      come to Orham again very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose likely not,&rdquo; chuckled Captain Eri. &ldquo;I ought to have kept his
      hat; then, maybe, he&rsquo;d have come back after it. Oh, say!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been meanin&rsquo; to ask you somethin&rsquo;. Made up your mind &lsquo;bout that western
      job yit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph shook his head. &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I shall very soon,
      though, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of puzzlin&rsquo; you, is it? Not that it&rsquo;s really any of my affairs, you
      understand. There&rsquo;s only a few of us good folks left, as the feller said,
      and I&rsquo;d hate to see you leave, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not anxious to go, myself. My present position gives me a good deal
      of leisure time for experimental work&mdash;and&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll tell you
      in confidence&mdash;there&rsquo;s a possibility of my becoming superintendent
      one of these days, if I wish to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! you don&rsquo;t say! Mr. Langley goin&rsquo; to quit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is thinking of it. The old gentleman has saved some money, and he has
      a sister in the West who is anxious to have him come out there and spend
      the remainder of his days with her. If he does, I can have his position, I
      guess. In fact, he has been good enough to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s pretty fine, ain&rsquo;t it? Langley ain&rsquo;t the man to chuck his
      good opinions round like clam shells. You ought to feel proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on silently for a few steps, the Captain waiting for his
      companion to speak, and the latter seeming disinclined to do so. At length
      the older man asked another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is t&rsquo;other job so much better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence again. Then Ralph said, &ldquo;The other position, Captain, is very much
      like this one in some respects. It will place me in a country town, even
      smaller than Orham, where there are few young people, no amusements, and
      no society, in the fashionable sense of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I thought you didn&rsquo;t care much for them things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this enigmatical answer the Captain made no immediate reply. After a
      moment, however, he said, slowly and with apparent irrelevance, &ldquo;Mr.
      Hazeltine, I can remember my father tellin&rsquo; &lsquo;bout a feller that lived down
      on the South Harniss shore when he was a boy. Queer old chap he was, named
      Elihu Bassett; everybody called him Uncle Elihu. In them days all hands
      drunk more or less rum, and Uncle Elihu drunk more. He had a way of
      stayin&rsquo; sober for a spell, and then startin&rsquo; off on a regular jamboree all
      by himself. He had an old flat-bottomed boat that he used to sail &lsquo;round
      in, but she broke her moorin&rsquo;s one time and got smashed up, so he wanted
      to buy another. Shadrach Wingate, Seth&rsquo;s granddad &lsquo;twas, tried to fix up a
      dicker with him for a boat he had. They agreed on the price, and
      everything was all right &lsquo;cept that Uncle Elihu stuck out that he must try
      her &lsquo;fore he bought her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Shad fin&rsquo;lly give in, and Uncle Elihu sailed over to Wellmouth in the
      boat. He put in his time &lsquo;round the tavern there, and when he come down to
      the boat ag&rsquo;in, he had a jugful of Medford in his hand, and pretty nigh as
      much of the same stuff under his hatches. He got afloat somehow, h&rsquo;isted
      the sail, lashed the tiller after a fashion, took a nip out of the jug and
      tumbled over and went fast asleep. &lsquo;Twas a still night or &lsquo;twould have
      been the finish. As &lsquo;twas he run aground on a flat and stuck there till
      mornin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next day back he comes with the boat all scraped up, and says he, &lsquo;She
      won&rsquo;t do, Shad; she don&rsquo;t keep her course.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t keep her course, you old fool!&rsquo; bellers Shad. &lsquo;And you tight as a
      drumhead and sound asleep! Think she can find her way home herself?&rsquo; he
      says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says Uncle Elihu, &lsquo;if she can&rsquo;t she ain&rsquo;t the boat for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps Uncle Elihu was wise. Still, if
      he wanted the boat very much, he must have hated to put her to the test.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; assented the Captain, &ldquo;but &lsquo;twas better to know it then than
      to be sorry for it afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both seemed to be thinking, and neither spoke again until they came to the
      grocery store, where Hazeltine stopped, saying that he must do an errand
      for Mr. Langley. They said good-night, and the Captain turned away, but
      came quickly back and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hazeltine, if it ain&rsquo;t too much trouble, would you mind steppin&rsquo; up
      to the schoolhouse when you&rsquo;ve done your errand? I&rsquo;ve left somethin&rsquo; there
      with Josiah, and I&rsquo;d like to have you git it. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; was the reply, and it was not until the Captain had gone that
      Ralph remembered he did not know what he was to get.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the school he climbed the stairs and opened the door,
      expecting to find Josiah alone. Instead, there was no one there but Elsie,
      who was sitting at the desk. She sprang up as he entered. Both were
      somewhat confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Preston,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Captain Eri sent me here. He said he
      left something with Josiah, and wished me to call for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what it can be,&rdquo; replied Elsie. &ldquo;Josiah has
      been gone for some time, and he said nothing to me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is in his desk,&rdquo; suggested Ralph. &ldquo;Suppose we look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they looked, but found nothing more than the usual assortment contained
      in the desk of a healthy schoolboy. The raised lid shut off the light from
      the window, and the desk&rsquo;s interior was rather dark. They had to grope in
      the corners, and occasionally their hands touched. Every time this
      happened Ralph thought of the decision that he must make so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of it still more when, after the search was abandoned, Elsie
      suggested that he help her with some problems that she was preparing for
      the next day&rsquo;s labors of the first class in arithmetic. In fact, as he sat
      beside her, pretending to figure, but really watching her dainty profile
      as it moved back and forth before his eyes, his own particular problem
      received far more attention than did those of the class. Suddenly he
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please, may I ask a question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should hold up your hand if you wish permission to speak,&rdquo; was the
      stern reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please consider it held up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the question as important as &lsquo;How many bushels did C. sell?&rsquo; which
      happens to be my particular trouble just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to me, certainly.&rdquo; Ralph was serious enough now. &ldquo;It is a question
      that I have been wrestling with for some time. It is, shall I take the
      position that has been offered me in the West, or shall I stay here and
      become superintendent of the station? The superintendent&rsquo;s place may be
      mine, I think, if I want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie laid down her pencil and hesitated for a moment before she spoke.
      When she did reply her face was turned away from her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that question might best be decided by comparing the
      salaries and prospects of the two positions,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two positions are much alike in one way. You know what the life at
      the station means the greater portion of the year&mdash;no companions of
      your own age and condition, no society, no amusements. The Western offer
      means all this and worse, for the situation is the same all the year. I
      say these things because I hope you may be willing to consider them, not
      from my point of view solely, but from yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see I am recklessly daring to hope that, whichever lot is
      chosen, you may be willing to share it with me&mdash;as my wife. Elsie, do
      you think you could consider the question from that viewpoint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And&mdash;well&mdash;Elsie thought she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consideration&mdash;we suppose it was the consideration&mdash;took so
      long that it was nearly dark when Elsie announced that she simply MUST go.
      It was Ralph&rsquo;s duty as a gentleman to help her in putting on her coat, and
      this took an astonishingly long time. Finally it was done, however, and
      they came downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; said Ralph, after the door was locked, &ldquo;I forgot to have
      another hunt for whatever it was that Captain Eri wanted me to get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elsie smiled rather oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you haven&rsquo;t got it?&rdquo; she asked demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got it! Why&mdash;why, by George, what a numbskull I am! The old rascal!
      I thought there was a twinkle in his eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he should come back after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! Bless his heart, it&rsquo;s sound and sweet all the way through.
      Yes, I HAVE got it, and, what&rsquo;s more, I shall tell him that I mean to keep
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gold watches from the people to the heroes of the Orham wreck having
      been duly bought and inscribed and the medals struck, there came up the
      question of presentation, and it was decided to perform the ceremony in
      the Orham town hall, and to make the occasion notable. The Congressman
      from the district agreed to make the necessary speech. The Harniss Cornet
      Band was to furnish music. All preparations were made, and it remained
      only to secure the consent of the parties most interested, namely, Captain
      Eri and Luther Davis.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the hardest task of all. Both men at first flatly refused to
      be present. The Captain said he might as well go to the dime museum and be
      done with it; he was much obliged to the Boston folks, but his own watch
      was keeping good time, and he didn&rsquo;t need a new one badly enough to make a
      show of himself to get it. Captain Davis said very much the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Patience was proud of her brother&rsquo;s rise to fame, and didn&rsquo;t
      intend to let him forfeit the crowning glory. She enlisted Captain Perez
      as a supporter, and together they finally got Luther&rsquo;s unwilling consent
      to sit on the platform and be stared at for one evening. Meanwhile,
      Captain Jerry, Elsie, Ralph, and Mrs. Snow were doing their best to win
      Captain Eri over. When Luther surrendered, the forces joined, and the
      Captain threw up his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only I ought to beg that dime museum feller&rsquo;s
      pardon. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t right to be partial this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall was jammed to the doors. Captain Eri, seated on the platform at
      one end of the half-circle of selectmen, local politicians, and minor
      celebrities, looked from the Congressman in the middle to Luther on the
      other end, and then out over the crowded settees. He saw Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s
      pleasant, wholesome face beaming proudly beside Captain Jerry&rsquo;s red one.
      He saw Captain Perez and Miss Patience sitting together close to the
      front, and Ralph and Elsie a little further back. The Reverend Mr. Perley
      was there; so were the Smalls and Miss Abigail Mullett. Melissa Busteed
      was on the very front bench with the boys, of whom Josiah was one. The
      &ldquo;train committee&rdquo; was there&mdash;not a member missing&mdash;and at the
      rear of the hall, smiling and unctuous as ever, was &ldquo;Web&rdquo; Saunders. In
      spite of his stage fright the Captain grinned when he saw &ldquo;Web.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Solomon Bangs, his shirt-bosom crackling with importance, introduced
      the Congressman. The latter&rsquo;s address was, so the Item said, &ldquo;a triumph of
      oratorical effort.&rdquo; It really was a good speech, and when it touched upon
      the simple sacrifice of the men who had given up their lives in the course
      of what, to them, was everyday work, there were stifled sobs all through
      the hall. Luther Davis, during this portion of the address, sat with his
      big hand shading his eyes. Later on, when the speaker was sounding the
      praises of the man who &ldquo;alone, forgetful of himself, braved the sea and
      the storm to save his friends,&rdquo; those who looked at Captain Eri saw his
      chair hitched back, inch by inch, until, as the final outburst came,
      little more than his Sunday shoes was in sight. He had retired, chair and
      all, to the wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they called him to the platform again and, amid&mdash;we quote from
      the Item once more&mdash;&ldquo;a hurricane of applause,&rdquo; the two heroes were
      adorned with the watches and the medals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sort of impromptu reception after the ceremony, when Captain
      Eri, with Mrs. Snow on his arm, struggled through the crowd toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas great, shipmate, and you deserved it!&rdquo; declared magnanimous Captain
      Jerry, wringing his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t ha&rsquo;f what you ought to have, Eri,&rdquo; said Captain Perez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said much to thank you for savin&rsquo; Luther,&rdquo; whispered Miss
      Patience, &ldquo;but I hope you know that we both appreciate what you done and
      never &lsquo;ll forgit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph and Elsie also shook hands with him, and said some pleasant things.
      So did many others, Dr. Palmer among the number. Altogether, the journey
      through the hall was a sort of triumphal progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; gasped the Captain, as they came out into the clear air and the
      moonlight, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hope that&rsquo;s the last of the dime-show bus&rsquo;ness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eri,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Snow, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so proud of you, I don&rsquo;t know what to
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that remark was sweeter to the Captain&rsquo;s ears than all those that had
      preceded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned into the shore road and were alone. It was a clear winter
      night, fresh, white snow on the ground, not a breath of wind, and the full
      moon painting land and sea dark blue and silver white. The surf sounded
      faint and far off. Somewhere in the distance a dog was barking, and
      through the stillness came an occasional laugh or shout from the people
      going home from the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lots of things can happen in a few months, can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow,
      glancing at the black shadow of the shuttered Baxter homestead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can so,&rdquo; replied the Captain. &ldquo;Think what&rsquo;s happened sence last
      September. I didn&rsquo;t know you then, and now it seems &lsquo;s if I&rsquo;d always known
      you. John was alive then, and Elsie nor Ralph hadn&rsquo;t come. Perez hadn&rsquo;t
      met Pashy neither. My! my! Everybody&rsquo;s choosed partners but Jerry,&rdquo; he
      chuckled, &ldquo;and Jerry looked the most likely candidate &lsquo;long at the
      beginnin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that Ralph&rsquo;s made up his mind to stay
      here. We shan&rsquo;t lose him nor Elsie for a few years, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They paused at the knoll by the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair day to-morrer,&rdquo; observed the Captain, looking up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it &lsquo;ll be fair weather for us the rest of our days,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve HAD it rough enough, that&rsquo;s sure. Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll have a
      smooth v&rsquo;yage, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady from Nantucket looked up into his face with a happy laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I shall,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve got a good pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
