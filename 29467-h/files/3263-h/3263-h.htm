    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      Overhead the clouds cloaked the sky; a ragged cloak it was, and, here and
      there, a star shone through a hole, to be obscured almost instantly as
      more cloud tatters were hurled across the rent. The pines threshed on the
      hill tops. The bare branches of the wild-cherry and silverleaf trees
      scraped and rattled and tossed. And the wind, the raw, chilling December
      wind, driven in, wet and salty, from the sea, tore over the dunes and
      brown uplands and across the frozen salt-meadows, screamed through the
      telegraph wires, and made the platform of the dismal South Harniss railway
      station the lonesomest, coldest, darkest and most miserable spot on the
      face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least that was the opinion of the seventeen-year-old boy whom the down
      train&mdash;on time for once and a wonder&mdash;had just deposited upon
      that platform. He would not have discounted the statement one iota. The
      South Harniss station platform WAS the most miserable spot on earth and he
      was the most miserable human being upon it. And this last was probably
      true, for there were but three other humans upon that platform and,
      judging by externals, they seemed happy enough. One was the station agent,
      who was just entering the building preparatory to locking up for the
      night, and the others were Jim Young, driver of the &ldquo;depot wagon,&rdquo; and
      Doctor Holliday, the South Harniss &ldquo;homeopath,&rdquo; who had been up to a
      Boston hospital with a patient and was returning home. Jim was whistling
      &ldquo;Silver Bells,&rdquo; a tune much in vogue the previous summer, and Doctor
      Holliday was puffing at a cigar and knocking his feet together to keep
      them warm while waiting to get into the depot wagon. These were the only
      people in sight and they were paying no attention whatever to the lonely
      figure at the other end of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked about him. The station, with its sickly yellow gleam of
      kerosene lamp behind its dingy windowpane, was apparently the only
      inhabited spot in a barren wilderness. At the edge of the platform
      civilization seemed to end and beyond was nothing but a black earth and a
      black sky, tossing trees and howling wind, and cold&mdash;raw, damp,
      penetrating cold. Compared with this even the stuffy plush seats and
      smelly warmth of the car he had just left appeared temptingly homelike and
      luxurious. All the way down from the city he had sneered inwardly at a
      one-horse railroad which ran no Pullmans on its Cape branch in winter
      time. Now he forgot his longing for mahogany veneer and individual chairs
      and would gladly have boarded a freight car, provided there were in it a
      lamp and a stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light in the station was extinguished and the agent came out with a
      jingling bunch of keys and locked the door. &ldquo;Good-night, Jim,&rdquo; he shouted,
      and walked off into the blackness. Jim responded with a &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; of
      his own and climbed aboard the wagon, into the dark interior of which the
      doctor had preceded him. The boy at the other end of the platform began to
      be really alarmed. It looked as if all living things were abandoning him
      and he was to be left marooned, to starve or freeze, provided he was not
      blown away first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the suitcase&mdash;an expensive suitcase it was, elaborately
      strapped and buckled, with a telescope back and gold fittings&mdash;and
      hastened toward the wagon. Mr. Young had just picked up the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&mdash;oh, I say!&rdquo; faltered the boy. We have called him &ldquo;the boy&rdquo; all
      this time, but he did not consider himself a boy, he esteemed himself a
      man, if not full-grown physically, certainly so mentally. A man, with all
      a man&rsquo;s wisdom, and more besides&mdash;the great, the all-embracing wisdom
      of his age, or youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I say! Just a minute!&rdquo; he repeated. Jim Young put his head around
      the edge of the wagon curtain. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Eh? Who&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo;? Oh,
      was it you, young feller? Did you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow replied that he did. &ldquo;This is South Harniss, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Young chuckled. &ldquo;Darn sure thing,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;I give in that it
      looks consider&rsquo;ble like Boston, or Providence, R. I., or some of them
      capitols, but it ain&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s South Harniss, Cape Cod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Holliday, on the back seat of the depot wagon, chuckled. Jim did
      not; he never laughed at his own jokes. And his questioner did not
      chuckle, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a&mdash;does a Mr. Snow live here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was prompt, if rather indefinite. &ldquo;Um-hm,&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;No
      less&rsquo;n fourteen of him lives here. Which one do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Mr. Z. Snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Z. Snow, eh? Humph! I don&rsquo;t seem to recollect any Mr. Z. Snow around
      nowadays. There used to be a Ziba Snow, but he&rsquo;s dead. &lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t him you
      wanted, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The one I want is&mdash;is a Captain Snow. Captain&mdash;&rdquo; he paused
      before uttering the name which to his critical metropolitan ear had seemed
      so dreadfully countrified and humiliating; &ldquo;Captain Zelotes Snow,&rdquo; he
      blurted, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Young laughed aloud. &ldquo;Good land, Doc!&rdquo; he cried, turning toward his
      passenger; &ldquo;I swan I clean forgot that Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s name begun with a Z.
      Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow? Why, darn sure! I . . . Eh?&rdquo; He stopped short, evidently
      struck by a new idea. &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; he drawled, slowly. &ldquo;Why, I declare I believe
      you&rsquo;re . . . Yes, of course! I heard they was expectin&rsquo; you. Doc, you know
      who &lsquo;tis, don&rsquo;t you? Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s grandson; Janie&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the lighted lantern from under the wagon seat and held it up so
      that its glow shone upon the face of the youth standing by the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to favor Janie much, does he, Doc. Kind of
      got her mouth and chin, though. Remember that sort of good-lookin&rsquo; set to
      her mouth she had? And SHE got it from old Cap&rsquo;n Lo himself. This boy&rsquo;s
      face must be more like his pa&rsquo;s, I cal&rsquo;late. Don&rsquo;t you cal&rsquo;late so, Doc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Doctor Holliday cal&rsquo;lated so or not he did not say. It may be that
      he thought this cool inspection of and discussion concerning a stranger,
      even a juvenile stranger, somewhat embarrassing to its object. Or the
      lantern light may have shown him an ominous pucker between the boy&rsquo;s black
      brows and a flash of temper in the big black eyes beneath them. At any
      rate, instead of replying to Mr. Young, he said, kindly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain Snow lives in the village. If you are going to his house get
      right in here. I live close by, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darned sure!&rdquo; agreed Mr. Young, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Hop right in, sonny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the boy hesitated. Then, haughtily ignoring the driver, he said: &ldquo;I
      thought Captain Snow would be here to meet me. He wrote that he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The irrepressible Jim had no idea of remaining ignored. &ldquo;Did Cap&rsquo;n Lote
      write you that he&rsquo;d be here to the depot?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;All right, then
      he&rsquo;ll be here, don&rsquo;t you fret. I presume likely that everlastin&rsquo; mare of
      his has eat herself sick again; eh, Doc? By godfreys domino, the way they
      pet and stuff that fool horse is a sin and a shame. It ain&rsquo;t Lote&rsquo;s fault
      so much as &lsquo;tis his wife&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s responsible. Don&rsquo;t you fret, Bub,
      the cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;ll be here for you some time to-night. If he said he&rsquo;ll come
      he&rsquo;ll come, even if he has to hire one of them limmysines. He, he, he! All
      you&rsquo;ve got to do is wait, and . . . Hey! . . . Hold on a minute! . . .
      Bub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy was walking away. And to hail him as &ldquo;Bub&rdquo; was, although Jim Young
      did not know it, the one way least likely to bring him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bub!&rdquo; shouted Jim again. Receiving no reply he added what he had intended
      saying. &ldquo;If I run afoul of Cap&rsquo;n Lote anywheres on the road,&rdquo; he called,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re here a-waitin&rsquo;. So long, Bub. Git dap, Chain
      Lightnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse, thus complimented, pricked up one ear, lifted a foot, and
      jogged off. The depot wagon became merely a shadowy smudge against the
      darkness of the night. For a few minutes the &ldquo;chock, chock&rdquo; of the hoofs
      upon the frozen road and the rattle of wheels gave audible evidence of its
      progress. Then these died away and upon the windswept platform of the
      South Harniss station descended the black gloom of lonesomeness so
      complete as to make that which had been before seem, by comparison, almost
      cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth upon that platform turned up his coat collar, thrust his gloved
      hands into his pockets, and shivered. Then, still shivering, he took a
      brisk walk up and down beside the suitcase and, finally, circumnavigated
      the little station. The voyage of discovery was unprofitable; there was
      nothing to discover. So far as he could see&mdash;which was by no means
      far&mdash;upon each side of the building was nothing but bare fields and
      tossing pines, and wind and cold and blackness. He came to anchor once
      more by the suitcase and drew a long, hopeless breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of the cheery dining room at the school he had left the day
      before. Dinner would be nearly over by now. The fellows were having
      dessert, or, probably, were filing out into the corridors, the younger
      chaps to go to the study hall and the older ones&mdash;the lordly seniors,
      of whom he had been one&mdash;on the way to their rooms. The picture of
      his own cheerful, gay room in the senior corridor was before his mind; of
      that room as it was before the telegram came, before the lawyer came with
      the letter, before the end of everything as he knew it and the beginning
      of&mdash;this. He had not always loved and longed for that school as he
      loved and longed for it now. There had been times when he referred to it
      as &ldquo;the old jail,&rdquo; and professed to hate it. But it had been the only real
      home he had known since he was eight years old and now he looked back upon
      it as a fallen angel might have looked back upon Paradise. He sighed
      again, choked and hastily drew his gloved hand across his eyes. At the age
      of seventeen it is very unmanly to cry, but, at that age also, manhood and
      boyhood are closely intermingled. He choked again and then, squaring his
      shoulders, reached into his coat pocket for the silver cigarette case
      which, as a recent acquisition, was the pride of his soul. He had just
      succeeded in lighting a cigarette when, borne upon the wind, he heard once
      more the sound of hoofs and wheels and saw in the distance a speck of
      light advancing toward the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sounds drew nearer, so did the light. Then an old-fashioned buggy,
      drawn by a plump little sorrel, pulled up by the platform and a hand held
      a lantern aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; hailed a voice. &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hail did not have to be repeated. Before the vehicle reached the
      station the boy had tossed away the cigarette, picked up the suitcase, and
      was waiting. Now he strode into the lantern light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he answered, trying hard not to appear too eager. &ldquo;Were you
      looking for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The holder of the lantern tucked the reins between the whip-socket and the
      dash and climbed out of the buggy. He was a little man, perhaps about
      forty-eight or fifty, with a smooth-shaven face wrinkled at the corners of
      the mouth and eyes. His voice was the most curious thing about him; it was
      high and piping, more like a woman&rsquo;s than a man&rsquo;s. Yet his words and
      manner were masculine enough, and he moved and spoke with a nervous, jerky
      quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered the question promptly. &ldquo;Guess I be, guess I be,&rdquo; he said
      briskly. &ldquo;Anyhow, I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; for a boy name of&mdash;name of&mdash;My
      soul to heavens, I&rsquo;ve forgot it again, I do believe! What did you say your
      name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speranza. Albert Speranza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, sartin! Sper&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;yes, yes. Knew it just as
      well as I did my own. Well, well, well! Ye-es, yes, yes. Get right aboard,
      Alfred. Let me take your satchel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the suitcase. The boy, his foot upon the buggy step, still
      hesitated. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re&mdash;you&rsquo;re not my grandfather?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Who? Your grandfather? Me? He, he, he!&rdquo; He chuckled shrilly. &ldquo;No, no!
      No such luck. If I was Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow, I&rsquo;d be some older&rsquo;n I be now and a
      dum sight richer. Yes, yes. No, I&rsquo;m Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s bookkeeper over at the
      lumber consarn. He&rsquo;s got a cold, and Olive&mdash;that&rsquo;s his wife&mdash;she
      said he shouldn&rsquo;t come out to-night. He said he should, and while they was
      Katy-didin&rsquo; back and forth about it, Rachel&mdash;Mrs. Ellis&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      the hired housekeeper there&mdash;she telephoned me to harness up and come
      meet you up here to the depot. Er&mdash;er&mdash;little mite late, wan&rsquo;t
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, just a little. The other man, the one who drives the mail cart&mdash;I
      think that was what it was&mdash;said perhaps the horse was sick, or
      something like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, no, that wan&rsquo;t it this time. I&mdash;er&mdash;All tucked in and
      warm enough, be you? Ye-es, yes, yes. No, I&rsquo;m to blame, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder. I stopped at the&mdash;at the store a minute and met one or two of
      the fellers, and that kind of held me up. All right now? Ye-es, yes, yes.
      G&rsquo;long, gal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The buggy moved away from the platform. Its passenger, his chilly feet and
      legs tightly wrapped in the robes, drew a breath of relief between his
      chattering teeth. He was actually going somewhere at last; whatever
      happened, morning would not find him propped frozen stiff against the
      scarred and mangy clapboards of the South Harniss station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warm enough, be you?&rdquo; inquired his driver cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good. Ye-es, yes, yes. Well&mdash;er&mdash;Frederick,
      how do you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to like South Harniss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was rather non-committal. The boy replied that he had not seen
      very much of it as yet. His companion seemed to find the statement highly
      amusing. He chuckled and slapped his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t seen much of it, eh? No-o, no, no. I guess you ain&rsquo;t, guess you
      ain&rsquo;t. He, he, he . . . Um . . . Let&rsquo;s see, what was I talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing in particular, I think, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you my name? Sho, sho! That&rsquo;s funny. My name&rsquo;s Keeler&mdash;Laban
      B. Keeler. That&rsquo;s my name and bookkeeper is my station. South Harniss is
      my dwellin&rsquo; place&mdash;and I guess likely you&rsquo;ll have to see the minister
      about the rest of it. He, he, he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His passenger, to whom the old schoolbook quatrain was entirely unknown,
      wondered what on earth the man was talking about. However, he smiled
      politely and sniffed with a dawning suspicion. It seemed to him there was
      an unusual scent in the air, a spirituous scent, a&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a peppermint lozenger,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Keeler, with sudden
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;Peppermint is good for what ails you, so they tell me. Ye-es,
      yes, yes. Have one. Have two, have a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded to have a lot himself, and the buggy was straightway
      reflavored, so to speak. The boy, his suspicions by no means dispelled,
      leaned back in the corner behind the curtains and awaited developments. He
      was warmer, that was a real physical and consequently a slight mental
      comfort, but the feeling of lonesomeness was still acute. So far his
      acquaintanceship with the citizens of South Harniss had not filled him
      with enthusiasm. They were what he, in his former and very recent state of
      existence, would have called &ldquo;Rubes.&rdquo; Were the grandparents whom he had
      never met this sort of people? It seemed probable. What sort of a place
      was this to which Fate had consigned him? The sense of utter helplessness
      which had had him in its clutches since the day when he received the news
      of his father&rsquo;s death was as dreadfully real as ever. He had not been
      consulted at all. No one had asked him what he wished to do, or where he
      wished to go. The letter had come from these people, the Cape Cod
      grandparents of whom, up to that time, he had never even heard, and he had
      been shipped to them as though he were a piece of merchandise. And what
      was to become of him now, after he reached his destination? What would
      they expect him to do? Or be? How would he be treated?
    </p>
    <p>
      In his extensive reading&mdash;he had been an omnivorous reader&mdash;there
      were numerous examples of youths left, like him, to the care of distant
      relatives, or step-parents, or utter strangers. Their experiences,
      generally speaking, had not been cheerful ones. Most of them had run away.
      He might run away; but somehow the idea of running away, with no money, to
      face hardship and poverty and all the rest, did not make an alluring
      appeal. He had been used to comfort and luxury ever since he could
      remember, and his imagination, an unusually active one, visualized much
      more keenly than the average the tribulations and struggles of a runaway.
      David Copperfield, he remembered, had run away, but he did it when a kid,
      not a man like himself. Nicholas Nickleby&mdash;no, Nicholas had not run
      away exactly, but his father had died and he had been left to an uncle. It
      would be dreadful if his grandfather should turn out to be a man like
      Ralph Nickleby. Yet Nicholas had gotten on well in spite of his wicked
      relative. Yes, and how gloriously he had defied the old rascal, too! He
      wondered if he would ever be called upon to defy his grandfather. He saw
      himself doing it&mdash;quietly, a perfect gentleman always, but with the
      noble determination of one performing a disagreeable duty. His chin lifted
      and his shoulders squared against the back of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler, who had apparently forgotten his passenger altogether, broke
      into song,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my darlin&rsquo; hanky-panky
        And she wears a number two,
      Her father keeps a barber shop
        Way out in Kalamazoo.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He sang the foregoing twice over and then added a chorus, plainly
      improvised, made up of &ldquo;Di doos&rdquo; and &ldquo;Di dums&rdquo; ad lib. And the buggy
      rolled up and over the slope of a little hill and, in the face of a
      screaming sea wind, descended a long, gentle slope to where, scattered
      along a two-mile water frontage, the lights of South Harniss twinkled
      sparsely.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Did doo dum, dee dum, doo dum
       Di doo dum, doo dum dee.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So sang Mr. Keeler. Then he broke off his solo as the little mare turned
      in between a pair of high wooden posts bordering a drive, jogged along
      that drive for perhaps fifty feet, and stopped beside the stone step of a
      white front door. Through the arched window above that door shone
      lamplight warm and yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; commanded Mr. Keeler, most unnecessarily. Then, as if himself a
      bit uncertain as to his exact whereabouts, he peered out at the door and
      the house of which it was a part, afterward settling back to announce
      triumphantly: &ldquo;And here we be! Yes, sir, here we be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the door opened. A flood of lamplight poured upon the buggy and its
      occupants. And the boy saw two people standing in the doorway, a man and a
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the woman who spoke first. It was she who had opened the door. The
      man was standing behind her looking over her shoulder&mdash;over her head
      really, for he was tall and broad and she short and slender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler answered. &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he declared emphatically, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s who
      &lsquo;tis. Here we be&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;what&rsquo;s-your-name&mdash;Edward.
      Jump right out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His passenger alighted from the buggy. The woman bent forward to look at
      him, her hands clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s Albert, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands unclasped and she held them out toward him. &ldquo;Oh, Albert,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your grandmother. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man interrupted. &ldquo;Wait till we get him inside, Olive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come
      in, son.&rdquo; Then, addressing the driver, he ordered: &ldquo;Labe, take the horse
      and team out to the barn and unharness for me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, yes, yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Keeler. &ldquo;Yes indeed, Cap&rsquo;n. Take her right
      along&mdash;right off. Yes indeedy. Git dap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove off toward the end of the yard, where a large building,
      presumably a barn, loomed black against the dark sky. He sang as he drove
      and the big man on the step looked after him and sniffed suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the boy had followed the little woman into the house through a
      small front hall, from which a narrow flight of stairs shot aloft with
      almost unbelievable steepness, and into a large room. Albert had a swift
      impression of big windows full of plants, of pictures of ships and
      schooners on the walls, of a table set for four.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your things right off,&rdquo; cried his grandmother. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll take &lsquo;em.
      There! now turn &lsquo;round and let me look at you. Don&rsquo;t move till I get a
      good look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood perfectly still while she inspected him from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got her mouth,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got her mouth. Her
      hair and eyes were brown and yours are black, but&mdash;but I THINK you
      look like her. Oh, I did so want you to! May I kiss you, Albert? I&rsquo;m your
      grandmother, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With embarrassed shyness he leaned forward while she put her arms about
      his neck and kissed him on the cheek. As he straightened again he became
      aware that the big man had entered the room and was regarding him intently
      beneath a pair of shaggy gray eyebrows. Mrs. Snow turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Zelotes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got Janie&rsquo;s mouth, don&rsquo;t you think so? And
      he DOES look like her, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband shook his head. &ldquo;Maybe so, Mother,&rdquo; he said, with a half
      smile. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a great hand for locatin&rsquo; who folks look like. How are
      you, boy? Glad to see you. I&rsquo;m your grandfather, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, while each inspected and made a mental estimate of the
      other. Albert saw a square, bearded jaw, a firm mouth, gray eyes with many
      wrinkles at the corners, and a shock of thick gray hair. The eyes had a
      way of looking straight at you, through you, as if reading your thoughts,
      divining your motives and making a general appraisal of you and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes Snow, for his part, saw a tall young fellow, slim and
      straight, with black curly hair, large black eyes and regular features. A
      good-looking boy, a handsome boy&mdash;almost too handsome, perhaps, or
      with just a touch of the effeminate in the good looks. The captain&rsquo;s
      glance took in the well-fitting suit of clothes, the expensive tie, the
      gold watch chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Zelotes. &ldquo;Well, your grandma and I are glad to
      have you with us. Let me see, Albert&mdash;that&rsquo;s your right name, ain&rsquo;t
      it&mdash;Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in his grandfather&rsquo;s looks or tone aroused a curious feeling in
      the youth. It was not a feeling of antagonism, exactly, but more of
      defiance, of obstinacy. He felt as if this big man, regarding him so
      keenly from under the heavy brows, was looking for faults, was expecting
      to find something wrong, might almost be disappointed if he did not find
      it. He met the gaze for a moment, the color rising to his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;is Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow uttered a little exclamation. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she ejaculated. And then
      added: &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I thought&mdash;we&mdash;we understood &lsquo;twas
      &lsquo;Albert.&rsquo; We didn&rsquo;t know there was&mdash;we didn&rsquo;t know there was any more
      to it. What did you say it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandson squared his shoulders. &ldquo;Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza,&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;My father&rdquo;&mdash;there was pride in his voice now&mdash;&ldquo;my
      father&rsquo;s name was Miguel Carlos. Of course you knew that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke as if all creation must have known it. Mrs. Snow looked
      helplessly at her husband. Captain Zelotes rubbed his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;ll,&rdquo; he drawled dryly, &ldquo;I guess likely we&rsquo;ll get along with
      &lsquo;Albert&rsquo; for a spell. I cal&rsquo;late &lsquo;twill come more handy to us Cape folks.
      We&rsquo;re kind of plain and everyday &lsquo;round here. Sapper&rsquo;s ready, ain&rsquo;t it,
      Mother? Al must be hungry. I&rsquo;m plaguey sure <i>I</i> am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Zelotes, maybe he&rsquo;d like to go up to his bedroom first. He&rsquo;s been
      ridin&rsquo; a long ways in the cars and maybe he&rsquo;d like to wash up or change
      his clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change his clothes! Lord sakes, Olive, what would he want to change his
      clothes this time of night for? You don&rsquo;t want to change your clothes, do
      you, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin sure you don&rsquo;t. Want to wash? There&rsquo;s a basin and soap and towel
      right out there in the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the kitchen door. At that moment the door was partially
      opened and a brisk feminine voice from behind it inquired: &ldquo;How about
      eatin&rsquo;? Are you all ready in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Captain Snow who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet we are, Rachel!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;All ready and then some. Trot her
      out. Sit down, Mother. Sit down, Al. Now then, Rachel, all aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel, it appeared, was the owner of the brisk feminine voice just
      mentioned. She was brisk herself, as to age about forty, plump, rosy and
      very business-like. She whisked the platter of fried mackerel and the
      dishes of baked potatoes, stewed corn, hot biscuits and all the rest, to
      the table is no time, and then, to Albert&rsquo;s astonishment, sat down at that
      table herself. Mrs. Snow did the honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is Mrs. Ellis, who helps me keep house. Rachel,
      this is my grandson, Albert&mdash;er&mdash;Speranza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pronounced the surname in a tone almost apologetic. Mrs. Ellis did not
      attempt to pronounce it. She extended a plump hand and observed: &ldquo;Is that
      so? Real glad to know you, Albert. How do you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to like
      South Harniss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Considering that his acquaintance with the village had been so decidedly
      limited, Albert was somewhat puzzled how to reply. His grandfather saved
      him the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord sakes, Rachel,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t seen more&rsquo;n three square foot
      of it yet. It&rsquo;s darker&rsquo;n the inside of a nigger&rsquo;s undershirt outdoors
      to-night. Well, Al&mdash;Albert, I mean, how are you on mackerel? Pretty
      good stowage room below decks? About so much, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes,&rdquo; she said reprovingly, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you forgettin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Forgettin&rsquo;? Heavens to Betsy, so I am! Lord, we thank thee for these
      and all other gifts, Amen. What did I do with the fork; swallow it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As long as he lives Albert Speranza will not forget that first meal in the
      home of his grandparents. It was so strange, so different from any other
      meal he had ever eaten. The food was good and there was an abundance of
      it, but the surroundings were so queer. Instead of the well-ordered and
      sedate school meal, here all the eatables from fish to pie were put upon
      the table at the same time and the servant&mdash;or housekeeper, which to
      his mind were one and the same&mdash;sat down, not only to eat with the
      family, but to take at least an equal part in the conversation. And the
      conversation itself was so different. Beginning with questions concerning
      his own journey from the New York town where the school was located, it at
      length reached South Harniss and there centered about the diminutive
      person of Laban Keeler, his loquacious and tuneful rescuer from the
      platform of the railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your things, Albert?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;Your trunk or travelin&rsquo; 
      bag, or whatever you had, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My trunks are coming by express,&rdquo; began the boy. Captain Zelotes
      interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trunks?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Got more&rsquo;n one, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes, there are three. Mr. Holden&mdash;he is the
      headmaster, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Headmaster? Oh, you mean the boss teacher up there at the school?
      Yes, yes. Um-hm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. Holden says the trunks should get here in a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis, the housekeeper, made the next remark. &ldquo;Did I understand you
      to say you had THREE trunks?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three trunks for one boy! For mercy sakes, what have you got in &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, my things. My clothes and&mdash;and&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, or just about, I should say. Goodness gracious me, when I go
      up to Boston I have all I can do to fill up one trunk. And I&rsquo;m bigger&rsquo;n
      you are&mdash;bigger &lsquo;round, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about that. Captain Zelotes laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That statement ain&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call exaggerated, Rachel,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;Every time I see you and Laban out walkin&rsquo; together he has to keep on the
      sunny side or be in a total eclipse. And, by the way, speakin&rsquo; of Laban&mdash;Say,
      son, how did you and he get along comin&rsquo; down from the depot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. It was pretty dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you! Laban wasn&rsquo;t very talkative, was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir, he talked a good deal but he sang most of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This simple statement appeared to cause a most surprising sensation. The
      Snows and their housekeeper looked at each other. Captain Zelotes leaned
      back in his chair and whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Hum! Sho! Thunderation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis, the housekeeper, drew a long breath. &ldquo;I might have expected
      it,&rdquo; she said tartly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past time. He&rsquo;s pretty nigh a month overdue,
      as &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Snow rose to his feet. &ldquo;I was kind of suspicious when he started
      for the barn,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Seemed to me he was singin&rsquo; then. WHAT did he
      sing, boy?&rdquo; he asked, turning suddenly upon his grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t notice particularly. You see, it
      was pretty cold and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis interrupted. &ldquo;Did he sing anything about somebody&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; his
      darlin&rsquo; hanky-panky and wearin&rsquo; a number two?&rdquo; she demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently that settled it. Mrs. Snow said, &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; again and the
      housekeeper also rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go right out to the barn this minute, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and I guess likely I&rsquo;d better go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain already had his cap on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rachel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you. Cal&rsquo;late I can take care of
      &lsquo;most anything that&rsquo;s liable to have happened. If he ain&rsquo;t put the bridle
      to bed in the stall and hung the mare up on the harness pegs I judge I can
      handle the job. Wonder how fur along he&rsquo;d got. Didn&rsquo;t hear him singin&rsquo; 
      anything about &lsquo;Hyannis on the Cape,&rsquo; did you, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s some comfort. Now, don&rsquo;t you worry, Mother. I&rsquo;ll be back in a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow clasped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, I HOPE he hasn&rsquo;t set the barn afire,&rdquo;
       she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger of that, I guess. No, Rachel, you &lsquo;tend to your supper. I don&rsquo;t
      need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tramped out into the hall and the door closed behind him. Mrs. Snow
      turned apologetically to her puzzled grandson, who was entirely at a loss
      to know what the trouble was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Albert,&rdquo; she hesitatingly explained, &ldquo;Laban&mdash;Mr. Keeler&mdash;the
      man who drove you down from the depot&mdash;he&mdash;he&rsquo;s an awful nice
      man and your grandfather thinks the world and all of him, but&mdash;but
      every once in a while he&mdash;Oh, dear, I don&rsquo;t know how to say it to
      you, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Mrs. Ellis knew how to say it, for she broke into the
      conversation and said it then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every once in a while he gets tipsy,&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;And I only wish I had
      my fingers this minute in the hair of the scamp that gave him the liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light broke upon Albert&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Oh! Oh, yes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought
      he acted a little queer, and once I thought I smelt&mdash;Oh, that was why
      he was eating the peppermints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow nodded. There was a moment of silence. Suddenly the housekeeper,
      who had resumed her seat in compliance with Captain Zelotes&rsquo; order,
      slammed back her chair and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hated the smell of peppermint for twenty-two year,&rdquo; she declared,
      and went out into the kitchen. Albert, looking after her, felt his
      grandmother&rsquo;s touch upon his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say any more about it before her,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s awful
      sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why in the world the housekeeper should be particularly sensitive because
      the man who had driven him from the station ate peppermint was quite
      beyond the boy&rsquo;s comprehension. Nor could he thoroughly understand why the
      suspicion of Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s slight inebriety should cause such a sensation
      in the Snow household. He was inclined to think the tipsiness rather
      funny. Of course alcohol was lectured against often enough at school and
      on one occasion a member of the senior class&mdash;a twenty-year-old
      &ldquo;hold-over&rdquo; who should have graduated the fall before&mdash;had been
      expelled for having beer in his room; but during his long summer
      vacations, spent precariously at hotels or in short visits to his father&rsquo;s
      friends, young Speranza had learned to be tolerant. Tolerance was a
      necessary virtue in the circle surrounding Speranza Senior, in his later
      years. The popping of corks at all hours of the night and bottles full,
      half full or empty, were sounds and sights to which Albert had been well
      accustomed. When one has more than once seen his own father overcome by
      conviviality and the affair treated as a huge joke, one is not inclined to
      be too censorious when others slip. What if the queer old Keeler guy was
      tight? Was that anything to raise such a row about?
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly, he decided, this was a strange place, this household of his
      grandparents. His premonition that they might be &ldquo;Rubes&rdquo; seemed likely to
      have been well founded. What would his father&mdash;his great,
      world-famous father&mdash;have thought of them? &ldquo;Bah! these Yankee
      bourgeoisie!&rdquo; He could almost hear him say it. Miguel Carlos Speranza
      detested&mdash;in private&mdash;the Yankee bourgeoisie. He took their
      money and he married one of their daughters, but he detested them. During
      his last years, when the money had not flowed his way as copiously, the
      detest grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say anything about Laban before Mrs. Ellis, will you, Albert?&rdquo;
       persisted Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dreadful sensitive. I&rsquo;ll explain by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He promised, repressing a condescending smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the housekeeper and Captain Snow returned in a few minutes. The
      latter reported that the mare was safe and sound in her stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The harness was mostly on the floor, but Jess was all right, thank the
      Lord,&rdquo; observed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jess is our horse&rsquo;s name, Albert,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;That is, her
      name&rsquo;s Jessamine, but Zelotes can&rsquo;t ever seem to say the whole of any
      name. When we first bought Jessamine I named her Magnolia, but he called
      her &lsquo;Mag&rsquo; all the time and I COULDN&rsquo;T stand that. Have some more
      preserves, Albert, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All through the meal Albert was uneasily conscious that his grandfather
      was looking at him from under the shaggy brows, measuring him, estimating
      him, reading him through and through. He resented the scrutiny and the
      twinkle of sardonic humor which, it seemed to him, accompanied it. His way
      of handling his knife and fork, his clothes, his tie, his manner of eating
      and drinking and speaking, all these Captain Zelotes seemed to note and
      appraise. But whatever the results of his scrutiny and appraisal might be
      he kept them entirely to himself. When he addressed his grandson directly,
      which was not often, his remarks were trivial commonplaces and, although
      pleasant enough, were terse and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times Mrs. Snow would have questioned Albert concerning the life
      at school, but each time her husband interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, not now, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boy ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to run away
      to-night. He&rsquo;ll be here to-morrow and a good many to-morrows, if&rdquo;&mdash;and
      here again Albert seemed to detect the slight sarcasm and the twinkle&mdash;&ldquo;if
      we old-fashioned &lsquo;down easters&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t too common and every-day for a
      high-toned young chap like him to put up with. No, no, don&rsquo;t make him talk
      to-night. Can&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s so sleepy that it&rsquo;s only the exercise of
      openin&rsquo; his mouth to eat that keeps his eyes from shuttin&rsquo;? How about
      that, son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly true. The long train ride, the excitement, the cold wait
      on the station platform and the subsequent warmth of the room, the hearty
      meal, all these combined to make for sleepiness so overpowering that
      several times the boy had caught his nose descending toward his plate in a
      most inelegant nod. But it hurt his pride to think his grandfather had
      noticed his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he said, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow the dignity seemed to have little effect upon Captain Zelotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;yes, I know,&rdquo; observed the latter dryly, &ldquo;but I guess likely
      you&rsquo;ll be more all right in bed. Mother, you&rsquo;ll show Albert where to turn
      in, won&rsquo;t you? There&rsquo;s your suitcase out there in the hall, son. I fetched
      it in from the barn just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow ventured a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Zelotes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t we goin&rsquo; to talk with him at ALL? Why,
      there is so much to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twill say just as well to-morrow mornin&rsquo;, Mother; better, because we&rsquo;ll
      have all day to say it in. Get the lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only half-past nine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes, who also had been looking at the watch, which was a very
      fine and very expensive one, smiled slightly. &ldquo;Half-past nine some
      nights,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is equal to half-past twelve others. This is one of the
      some. There, there, son, you&rsquo;re so sleepy this minute that you&rsquo;ve got a
      list to starboard. When you and I have that talk that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to us we
      want to be shipshape and on an even keel. Rachel, light that lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper brought in and lighted a small hand lamp. Mrs. Snow took
      it and led the way to the hall and the narrow, breakneck flight of stairs.
      Captain Zelotes laid a hand on his grandson&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, son,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked into the gray eyes. Their expression was not unkindly, but
      there was, or he imagined there was, the same quizzical, sardonic twinkle.
      He resented that twinkle more than ever; it made him feel very young
      indeed, and correspondingly obstinate. Something of that obstinacy showed
      in his own eyes as he returned his grandfather&rsquo;s look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night&mdash;sir,&rdquo; he said, and for the life of him he could not
      resist hesitating before adding the &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; As he climbed the steep stairs
      he fancied he heard a short sniff or chuckle&mdash;he was not certain
      which&mdash;from the big man in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bedroom was a good-sized room; that is, it would have been of good
      size if the person who designed it had known what the term &ldquo;square&rdquo; meant.
      Apparently he did not, and had built the apartment on the hit-or-miss,
      higglety-pigglety pattern, with unexpected alcoves cut into the walls and
      closets and chimneys built out from them. There were three windows, a big
      bed, an old-fashioned bureau, a chest of drawers, a washstand, and several
      old-fashioned chairs. Mrs. Snow put the lamp upon the bureau. She watched
      him anxiously as he looked about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you like it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert replied that he guessed he did. Perhaps there was not too much
      certainty in his tone. He had never before seen a room like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope you will like it! It was your mother&rsquo;s room, Albert. She slept
      here from the time she was seven until&mdash;until she went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked about him with a new interest, an odd thrill. His mother&rsquo;s
      room. His mother. He could just remember her, but that was all. The
      memories were childish and unsatisfactory, but they were memories. And she
      had slept there; this had been her room when she was a girl, before she
      married, before&mdash;long before such a person as Alberto Miguel Carlos
      Speranza had been even dreamed of. That was strange, it was queer to think
      about. Long before he was born, when she was years younger than he as he
      stood there now, she had stood there, had looked from those windows, had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandmother threw her arms about his neck and kissed him. Her cheek
      was wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Albert,&rdquo; she said chokingly, and hurried out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He undressed quickly, for the room was very cold. He opened the window,
      after a desperate struggle, and climbed into bed. The wind, whistling in,
      obligingly blew out the lamp for him. It shrieked and howled about the
      eaves and the old house squeaked and groaned. Albert pulled the comforter
      up about his neck and concentrated upon the business of going to sleep.
      He, who could scarcely remember when he had had a real home, was
      desperately homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs in the dining-room Captain Zelotes stood, his hands in his
      pockets, looking through the mica panes of the stove door at the fire
      within. His wife came up behind him and laid a hand on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinkin&rsquo; about, Father?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband shook his head. &ldquo;I was wonderin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what my granddad,
      the original Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow that built this house, would have said if
      he&rsquo;d known that he&rsquo;d have a great-great-grandson come to live in it who
      was,&rdquo; scornfully, &ldquo;a half-breed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive&rsquo;s grip tightened on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DON&rsquo;T talk so, Zelotes,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our Janie&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain opened the stove door, regarded the red-hot coals for an
      instant, and then slammed the door shut again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Mother,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the sake of Janie&rsquo;s half that
      I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; in the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, Zelotes, don&rsquo;t you think he seems like a nice boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The twinkle reappeared in Captain Lote&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think HE thinks he&rsquo;s a nice boy, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There, there, let&rsquo;s
      go to bed.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The story of the events which led up to the coming, on this December
      night, of a &ldquo;half-breed&rdquo; grandson to the Snow homestead, was an old story
      in South Harniss. The date of its beginning was as far back as the year
      1892.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fall of that year Captain Zelotes Snow was in Savannah. He was in
      command of the coasting schooner Olive S. and the said schooner was then
      discharging a general cargo, preparatory to loading with rice and cotton
      for Philadelphia. With the captain in Savannah was his only daughter, Jane
      Olivia, age a scant eighteen, pretty, charming, romantic and head over
      heels in love with a handsome baritone then singing in a popular-priced
      grand opera company. It was because of this handsome baritone, who, by the
      way, was a Spaniard named Miguel Carlos Speranza, that Jane Snow was then
      aboard her father&rsquo;s vessel. Captain Lote was not in the habit of taking
      his women-folks on his voyages with him. &ldquo;Skirts clutter up the deck too
      much,&rdquo; was his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken Jane, however, not only on this voyage, but on that preceding
      it, which had been to Rio. It was Captain Lote&rsquo;s belief, and his wife&rsquo;s
      hope, that a succession of sea winds might blow away recollections of
      Senor Speranza&mdash;&ldquo;fan the garlic out of her head,&rdquo; as the captain
      inelegantly expressed it. Jane had spent her sixteenth and seventeenth
      years at a school for girls near Boston. The opera company of which
      Speranza was a member was performing at one of the minor theaters. A party
      of the school girls, duly chaperoned and faculty-guarded, of course,
      attended a series of matinees. At these matinees Jane first saw her hero,
      brave in doublet and hose, and braver still in melody and romance. She and
      her mates looked and listened and worshiped from afar, as is the habit of
      maidenly youth under such circumstances. There is no particular danger in
      such worship provided the worshiper remains always at a safely remote
      distance from the idol. But in Jane&rsquo;s case this safety-bar was removed by
      Fate. The wife of a friend of her father&rsquo;s, the friend being a Boston
      merchant named Cole with whom Captain Zelotes had had business dealings
      for many years, was a music lover. She was in the habit of giving what she
      was pleased to call &ldquo;musical teas&rdquo; at her home. Jane, to whom Mr. and Mrs.
      Cole had taken a marked fancy, was often invited to those teas and,
      because the Coles were &ldquo;among our nicest people,&rdquo; she was permitted by the
      school authorities to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of those teas Senor Miguel Carlos Speranza was the brightest star.
      The Senor, then in his twenty-ninth year, handsome, talented and
      picturesque, shone refulgent. Other and far more experienced feminine
      hearts than Jane Snow&rsquo;s were flutteringly disturbed by the glory of his
      rays. Jane and he met, they shook hands, they conversed. And at subsequent
      teas they met again, for Speranza, on his part, was strongly attracted to
      the simple, unaffected Cape Cod schoolgirl. It was not her beauty alone&mdash;though
      beauty she had and of an unusual type&mdash;it was something else, a
      personality which attracted all who met her. The handsome Spaniard had had
      many love affairs of a more or less perfunctory kind, but here was
      something different, something he had not known. He began by exerting his
      powers of fascination in a lazy, careless way. To his astonishment the
      said powers were not overwhelming. If Jane was fascinated she was not
      conquered. She remained sweet, simple, direct, charmingly aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Speranza was at first puzzled, then piqued, then himself madly
      fascinated. He wrote fervid letters, he begged for interviews, he haunted
      each one of Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s &ldquo;teas.&rdquo; And, at last, he wrung from Jane a
      confession of her love, her promise to marry him. And that very week Miss
      Donaldson, the head of the school, discovered and read a package of the
      Senor&rsquo;s letters to her pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes happened to be at home from a voyage. Being summoned from
      South Harniss, he came to Boston and heard the tale from Miss Donaldson&rsquo;s
      agitated lips. Jane was his joy, his pride; her future was the great hope
      and dream of his life. WHEN she married&mdash;which was not to be thought
      of for an indefinite number of years to come&mdash;she would of course
      marry a&mdash;well, not a President of the United States, perhaps&mdash;but
      an admiral possibly, or a millionaire, or the owner of a fleet of
      steamships, or something like that. The idea that she should even think of
      marrying a play-actor was unbelievable. The captain had never attended the
      performance of an opera; what was more, he never expected to attend one.
      He had been given to understand that a &ldquo;parcel of play-actin&rsquo; men and
      women hollered and screamed to music for a couple of hours.&rdquo; Olive, his
      wife, had attended an opera once and, according to her, it was more like a
      cat fight than anything else. Nobody but foreigners ever had anything to
      do with operas. And for foreigners of all kinds&mdash;but the Latin
      variety of foreigner in particular&mdash;Captain Zelotes Snow cherished a
      detest which was almost fanatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now his daughter, his own Janie, was receiving ardent love letters
      from a play-acting foreigner, a Spaniard, a &ldquo;Portygee,&rdquo; a
      &ldquo;macaroni-eater&rdquo;! When finally convinced that it was true, that the
      letters had really been written to Jane, which took some time, he demanded
      first of all to be shown the &ldquo;Portygee.&rdquo; Miss Donaldson could not, of
      course, produce the latter forthwith, but she directed her irate visitor
      to the theater where the opera company was then performing. To the theater
      Captain Zelotes went. He did not find Speranza there, but from a
      frightened attendant he browbeat the information that the singer was
      staying at a certain hotel. So the captain went to the hotel. It was
      eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, Senor Speranza was in bed and could not be
      disturbed. Couldn&rsquo;t, eh? By the great and everlasting et cetera and
      continued he was going to be disturbed then and there. And unless some of
      the hotel&rsquo;s &ldquo;hired help&rdquo; set about the disturbing it would be done for
      them. So, rather than summon the police, the hotel management summoned its
      guest, and the first, and only, interview between the father and lover of
      Jane Snow took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a long interview, but it was spirited. Captain Zelotes began by
      being what he considered diplomatic. Having assured his wife before
      leaving home, and the alarmed Miss Donaldson subsequently, that there was
      to be no trouble whatever&mdash;everything would be settled as smooth and
      easy as slidin&rsquo; downhill; &ldquo;that feller won&rsquo;t make any fuss, you&rsquo;ll see&rdquo;&mdash;having
      thus prophesied, the captain felt it incumbent upon himself to see to the
      fulfillment. So he began by condescendingly explaining that of course he
      was kind of sorry for the young man before him, young folks were young
      folks and of course he presumed likely &lsquo;twas natural enough, and the like
      of that, you understand. But of course also Mr. Speranza must realize that
      the thing could not go on any further. Jane was his daughter and her
      people were nice people, and naturally, that being the case, her mother
      and he would be pretty particular as to who she kept company with, to say
      nothing of marrying, which event was not to be thought of for ten years,
      anyway. Now he didn&rsquo;t want to be&mdash;er&mdash;personal or anything like
      that, and of course he wouldn&rsquo;t think of saying that Mr. Speranza wasn&rsquo;t a
      nice enough man for&mdash;well, for&mdash;for . . . You see, everybody
      wasn&rsquo;t as particular as he and Mrs. Snow were. But&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Senor Speranza interrupted. He politely desired to know if the person
      speaking was endeavoring to convey the idea that he, Miguel Carlos
      Speranza, was not of sufficient poseetion, goodness, standing, what it is?
      to be considered as suitor for that person&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s hand. Did Meester
      Snow comprehend to whom he addressed himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview terminated not long after. The captain&rsquo;s parting remark was
      in the nature of an ultimatum. It was to the effect that if Speranza, or
      any other condemned undesirable like him, dared to so much as look in the
      direction of Jane Olivia Snow, his daughter, he personally would see that
      the return for that look was a charge of buckshot. Speranza, white-faced
      and furiously gesticulative, commanded the astonished bellboy to put that
      &ldquo;Bah! pig-idiot!&rdquo; out into the hall and air the room immediately
      afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having, as he considered, satisfactorily attended to the presumptuous
      lover, Captain Zelotes returned to the school and to what he believed
      would be the comparatively easy task, the bringing of his daughter to
      reason. Jane had always been an obedient girl, she was devoted to her
      parents. Of course, although she might feel rather disappointed at first,
      she would soon get over it. The idea that she might flatly refuse to get
      over it, that she might have a will of her own, and a determination equal
      to that of the father from whom she inherited it, did not occur to the
      captain at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his enlightenment was prompt and complete. Jane did not rage or become
      hysterical, she did not even weep in his presence. But, quietly, with a
      set of her square little chin, she informed Captain Zelotes that she loved
      Speranza, that she meant to marry him and that she should marry him, some
      day or other. The captain raged, commanded, pleaded, begged. What was the
      matter with her? What had come over her? Didn&rsquo;t she love her father and
      mother any more that she should set out to act this way? Yes, she declared
      that she loved them as much as ever, but that she loved her lover more
      than all the world, and no one&mdash;not even her parents&mdash;should
      separate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes gave it up at last. That is, he gave up the appeal to
      reason and the pleadings. But he did not give up the idea of having his
      own way in the matter; being Zelotes Snow, he certainly did not give that
      up. Instead he took his daughter home with him to South Harniss, where a
      tearful and heart-broken Olive added her persuasions to his. But, when she
      found Jane obdurate, Mrs. Snow might have surrendered. Not her husband,
      however. Instead he conceived a brilliant idea. He was about to start on a
      voyage to Rio Janeiro; he would take his wife and daughter with him. Under
      their immediate observation and far removed from the influence of &ldquo;that
      Portygee,&rdquo; Jane would be in no danger and might forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane made no remonstrance. She went to Rio and returned. She was always
      calm, outwardly pleasant and quiet, never mentioned her lover unless in
      answer to a question; but she never once varied from her determination not
      to give him up. The Snows remained at home for a month. Then Zelotes, Jane
      accompanying him, sailed from Boston to Savannah. Olive did not go with
      them; she hated the sea and by this time both she and her husband were
      somewhat reassured. So far as they could learn by watchful observation of
      their daughter, the latter had not communicated with Speranza nor received
      communications from him. If she had not forgotten him it seemed likely
      that he had forgotten her. The thought made the captain furiously angry,
      but it comforted him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the voyage to Savannah this sense of comfort became stronger. Jane
      seemed in better spirits. She was always obedient, but now she began to
      seem almost cheerful, to speak, and even laugh occasionally just as she
      used to. Captain Zelotes patted himself on the back, figuratively. His
      scheme had been a good one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Savannah, one afternoon, Jane managed to elude her father&rsquo;s
      observation, to leave the schooner and to disappear completely. And that
      night came a letter. She and Miguel Carlos Speranza had been in
      correspondence all the time, how or through whose connivance is a mystery
      never disclosed. He had come to Savannah, in accordance with mutual
      arrangement; they had met, were married, and had gone away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Father,&rdquo; Jane wrote in the letter. &ldquo;I love you and Mother so
      very, VERY much. Oh, PLEASE believe that! But I love him, too. And I could
      not give him up. You will see why when you know him, really know him. If
      it were not for you I should be SO happy. I know you can&rsquo;t forgive me now,
      but some day I am sure you will forgive us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes was far, far from forgiveness as he read that letter. His
      first mate, who was beside him when he opened and read it, was actually
      frightened when he saw the look on the skipper&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;He went white,&rdquo;
       said the mate; &ldquo;not pale, but white, same as a dead man, or&mdash;or the
      underside of a flatfish, or somethin&rsquo;. &lsquo;For the Lord sakes, Cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; says
      I, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; He never answered me, stood starin&rsquo; at the letter.
      Then he looked up, not at me, but as if somebody else was standin&rsquo; there
      on t&rsquo;other side of the cabin table. &lsquo;Forgive him!&rsquo; he says, kind of slow
      and under his breath. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t forgive his black soul in hell.&rsquo; When I
      heard him say it I give you my word my hair riz under my cap. If ever
      there was killin&rsquo; in a man&rsquo;s voice and in his looks &lsquo;twas in Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s
      that night. When I asked him again what was the matter he didn&rsquo;t answer
      any more than he had the first time. A few minutes afterwards he went into
      his stateroom and shut the door. I didn&rsquo;t see him again until the next
      mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes made no attempt to follow the runaway couple. He did take
      pains to ascertain that they were legally married, but that was all. He
      left his schooner in charge of the mate at Savannah and journeyed north to
      South Harniss and his wife. A week he remained at home with her, then
      returned to the Olive S. and took up his command and its duties as if
      nothing had happened. But what had happened changed his whole life. He
      became more taciturn, a trifle less charitable, a little harder and more
      worldly. Before the catastrophe he had been interested in business success
      and the making of money chiefly because of his plans for his daughter&rsquo;s
      future. Now he worked even harder because it helped him to forget. He
      became sole owner of the Olive S., then of other schooners. People spoke
      of him as one destined to become a wealthy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane lived only a few years after her marriage. She died at the birth of
      her second child, who died with her. Her first, a boy, was born a year
      after the elopement. She wrote her mother to tell that news and Olive
      answered the letter. She begged permission of her husband to invite Jane
      and the baby to visit the old home. At first Zelotes said no, flatly; the
      girl had made her bed, let her lie in it. But a year later he had so far
      relented as to give reluctant consent for Jane and the child to come,
      provided her condemned husband did not accompany them. &ldquo;If that low-lived
      Portygee sets foot on my premises, so help me God, I&rsquo;ll kill him!&rdquo;
       declared the captain. In his vernacular all foreigners were &ldquo;Portygees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jane was as proud and stubborn as he. Where her husband was not
      welcome she would not go. And a little later she had gone on the longest
      of all journeys. Speranza did not notify her parents except to send a
      clipped newspaper account of her death and burial, which arrived a week
      after the latter had taken place. The news prostrated Olive, who was ill
      for a month. Captain Zelotes bore it, as he had borne the other great
      shock, with outward calm and quiet. Yet a year afterward he suddenly
      announced his determination of giving up the sea and his prosperous and
      growing shipping business and of spending the rest of his days on the
      Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive was delighted, of course. Riches&mdash;that is, more than a
      comfortable competency&mdash;had no temptations for her. The old house,
      home of three generations of Snows, was painted, repaired and, to some
      extent, modernized. For another year Captain Zelotes &ldquo;loafed,&rdquo; as he
      called it, although others might have considered his activities about the
      place anything but that. At the end of that year he surprised every one by
      buying from the heirs of the estate the business equipment of the late
      Eben Raymond, hardware dealer and lumber merchant of South Harniss, said
      equipment comprising an office, a store and lumber yards near the railway
      station. &ldquo;Got to have somethin&rsquo; to keep me from gettin&rsquo; barnacled,&rdquo;
       declared Captain Lote. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough old hulks rottin&rsquo; at their moorin&rsquo;s
      down here as &lsquo;tis. I don&rsquo;t know anything about lumber and half as much
      about hardware, but I cal&rsquo;late I can learn.&rdquo; As an aid in the learning
      process he retained as bookkeeper Laban Keeler, who had acted in that
      capacity for the former proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years slipped away, a dozen of them, as smoothly and lazily as South
      Harniss years have always slipped. Captain Zelotes was past sixty now, but
      as vigorous as when forty, stubborn as ever, fond of using quarter-deck
      methods on shore and especially in town-meeting, and very often in trouble
      in consequence. He was a member of the Board of Selectmen and was in the
      habit of characterizing those whose opinions differed from his as
      &ldquo;narrow-minded.&rdquo; They retorted by accusing him of being &ldquo;pig-headed.&rdquo;
       There was some truth on both sides. His detest of foreigners had not
      abated in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in this December of the year 1910, fell as from a clear sky the
      legacy of a grandson. From Senor Miguel Carlos Speranza the Snows had had
      no direct word, had received nothing save the newspaper clipping already
      mentioned. Olive had never seen him; her husband had seen him only on the
      occasion of the memorable interview in the hotel room. They never spoke of
      him, never mentioned him to each other. Occasionally, in the Boston
      newspapers, his likeness in costume had appeared amid the music notes or
      theatrical jottings. But these had not been as numerous of late. Of his
      son, their own daughter&rsquo;s child, they knew nothing; he might be alive or
      he might be dead. Sometimes Olive found herself speculating concerning
      him, wondering if he was alive, and if he resembled Jane. But she put the
      speculation from her thoughts; she could not bear to bring back memories
      of the old hopes and their bitter ending. Sometimes Captain Lote at his
      desk in the office of &ldquo;Z. Snow &amp; Co., Lumber and Builders&rsquo; Hardware,&rdquo;
       caught himself dreaming of his idolized daughter and thinking how
      different the future might have been for him had she married a &ldquo;white
      man,&rdquo; the kind of man he had meant for her to marry. There might be
      grandchildren growing up now, fine boys and girls, to visit the old home
      at South Harniss. &ldquo;Ah hum! Well! . . . Labe, how long has this bill of
      Abner Parker&rsquo;s been hangin&rsquo; on? For thunder sakes, why don&rsquo;t he pay up? He
      must think we&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; a meetin&rsquo;-house Christmas tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter from the lawyer had come first. It was written in New York, was
      addressed to &ldquo;Captain Lotus Snow,&rdquo; and began by taking for granted the
      fact that the recipient knew all about matters of which he knew nothing.
      Speranza was dead, so much was plain, and the inference was that he had
      been fatally injured in an automobile accident, &ldquo;particulars of which you
      have of course read in the papers.&rdquo; Neither Captain Lote nor his wife had
      read anything of the kind in the papers. The captain had been very busy of
      late and had read little except political news, and Mrs. Snow never read
      of murders and accidents, their details at least. She looked up from the
      letter, which her husband had hastened home from the office to bring her,
      with a startled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Zelotes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That part&rsquo;s plain enough, but go on. The rest of it
      is what I can&rsquo;t get a hand-hold on. See what you make of the rest of it,
      Olive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of it was to the effect that the writer, being Mr. Speranza&rsquo;s
      business adviser, &ldquo;that is to say, as much or more so than any one else,&rdquo;
       had been called in at the time of the accident, had conferred with the
      injured man, and had learned his last wishes. &ldquo;He expressed himself
      coherently concerning his son,&rdquo; went on the letter, &ldquo;and it is in regard
      to that son that I am asking an interview with you. I should have written
      sooner, but have been engaged with matters pertaining to Mr. Speranza&rsquo;s
      estate and personal debts. The latter seem to be large&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL bet you!&rdquo; observed Captain Zelotes, sententiously, interrupting his
      wife&rsquo;s reading by pointing to this sentence with a big forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the estate&rsquo;s affairs much tangled,&rsquo;&rdquo; went on Olive, reading aloud.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It seems best that I should see you concerning the boy at once. I don&rsquo;t
      know whether or not you are aware that he is at school in &mdash;&mdash;,
      New York. I am inclined to think that the estate itself will scarcely
      warrant the expense of his remaining there. Could you make it convenient
      to come to New York and see me at once? Or, if not, I shall be in Boston
      on Friday of next week and can you meet me there? It seems almost
      impossible for me to come to you just now, and, of course, you will
      understand that I am acting as a sort of temporary executor merely because
      Mr. Speranza was formerly my friend and not because I have any pecuniary
      interest in the settlement of his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very truly yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MARCUS W. WEISSMANN.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weissman! Another Portygee!&rdquo; snorted Captain Lote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but what does it MEAN?&rdquo; begged Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why should
      he want to see you, Zelotes? And the boy&mdash;why&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s HER
      boy. It&rsquo;s Janie&rsquo;s boy he must mean, Zelotes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hers and that blasted furriner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DON&rsquo;T speak that way, Zelotes! Don&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote&rsquo;s lips tightened. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d died twenty years ago &lsquo;twould have
      been better for all hands,&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janie&rsquo;s boy!&rdquo; repeated Olive slowly. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, he must be a big boy
      now. Almost grown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband did not speak. He was pacing the floor, his hands in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this man wants to see you about him,&rdquo; said Olive. Then, after a
      moment, she added timidly: &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo;, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To New York? To see this lawyer man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Not by a jugful! What in blazes should I go to see him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, he wants you to, you know. He wants to talk with you
      about the&mdash;the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her boy, Zelotes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Young Portygee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Zelotes! Please! . . . I know you can&rsquo;t forgive that&mdash;that
      man. We can&rsquo;t either of us forgive him; but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain stopped in his stride. &ldquo;Forgive him!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Mother,
      don&rsquo;t talk like a fool. Didn&rsquo;t he take away the one thing that I was
      workin&rsquo; for, that I was plannin&rsquo; for, that I was LIVIN&rsquo; for? I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted, putting a hand on his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the only thing, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You had me, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His expression changed. He looked down at her and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, old lady,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I had you, and thank the Almighty
      for it. Yes, I had you . . . But,&rdquo; his anger returning, &ldquo;when I think how
      that damned scamp stole our girl from us and then neglected her and killed
      her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ZELOTES! How you talk! He DIDN&rsquo;T kill her. How can you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean he murdered her, of course. But I&rsquo;ll bet all I&rsquo;ve got
      that he made her miserable. Look here, Mother, you and she used to write
      back and forth once in a while. In any one of those letters did she ever
      say she was happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow&rsquo;s answer was somewhat equivocal. &ldquo;She never said she was
      unhappy,&rdquo; she replied. Her husband sniffed and resumed his pacing up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little Olive spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York IS a good ways,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe &lsquo;twould be better for you to
      meet this lawyer man in Boston. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another interval. Then: &ldquo;Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; impatiently. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her boy, after all, isn&rsquo;t it? Our grandson, yours and mine. Don&rsquo;t
      you think&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s your duty to go, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote stamped his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For thunderation sakes, Olive, let up!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;You ought to know
      by this time that there&rsquo;s one thing I hate worse than doin&rsquo; my duty,
      that&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; preached to about it. Let up! Don&rsquo;t you say another word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not, having learned much by years of experience. He said the next
      word on the subject himself. At noon, when he came home for dinner, he
      said, as they rose from the table: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my suitcase, up attic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I guess likely &lsquo;tis. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering he turned to the housekeeper, Mrs. Ellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rachel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;go up and get that case and fetch it down to the
      bedroom, will you? Hurry up! Train leaves at half-past two and it&rsquo;s &lsquo;most
      one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both women stared at him. Mrs. Ellis spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;be you goin&rsquo; away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her employer&rsquo;s answer was crisp and very much to the point. &ldquo;I am if I can
      get that case time enough to pack it and make the train,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If
      you stand here askin&rsquo; questions I probably shall stay to home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper made a hasty exit by way of the back stairs. Mrs. Snow
      still gazed wonderingly at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;are you&mdash;are you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to New York on to-night&rsquo;s boat. I&rsquo;ve telegraphed that&mdash;that
      Weiss&mdash;Weiss&mdash;what-do-you-call-it&mdash;that Portygee lawyer&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;ll be to his office to-morrow mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Zelotes, we haven&rsquo;t scarcely talked about it, you and I, at all. You
      might have waited till he came to Boston. Why do you go so SOON?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s heavy brows drew together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to the dentist&rsquo;s last Friday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you wait
      till next week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, what a question! My tooth ached and I wanted to have it
      fixed quick as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m, yes. Well, this tooth aches and I want it fixed or hauled out, one
      or t&rsquo;other. I want the thing off my mind. . . . Don&rsquo;t TALK to me?&rdquo; he
      added, irritably. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a fool. And,&rdquo; with a peremptory wave of the
      hand, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you DARE say anything about DUTY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was back again two days later. His wife did not question him, but
      waited for him to speak. Those years of experience already mentioned had
      taught her diplomacy. He looked at her and pulled his beard. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
      observed, when they were alone together, &ldquo;I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the boy?&rdquo; eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Course not! The boy&rsquo;s at school somewhere up in New York State;
      how could I see him! I saw that lawyer and I found out about&mdash;about
      the other scamp. He was killed in an auto accident, drunk at the time, I
      cal&rsquo;late. Nigh&rsquo;s I can gather he&rsquo;s been drinkin&rsquo; pretty heavy for the last
      six or seven years. Always lived high, same as his kind generally does,
      and spent money like water, I judge&mdash;but goin&rsquo; down hill fast lately.
      His voice was givin&rsquo; out on him and he realized it, I presume likely. Now
      he&rsquo;s dead and left nothin&rsquo; but trunks full of stage clothes and
      photographs and,&rdquo; contemptuously, &ldquo;letters from fool women, and debts&mdash;Lord,
      yes! debts enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the boy, Zelotes. Janie&rsquo;s boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been at this school place for pretty nigh ten years, so the lawyer
      feller said. That lawyer was a pretty decent chap, too, for a furriner.
      Seems he used to know this&mdash;Speranza rascal&mdash;when Speranza was
      younger and more decent&mdash;if he ever was really decent, which I doubt.
      But this lawyer man was his friend then and about the only one he really
      had when he was hurt. There was plenty of make-believe friends hangin&rsquo; on,
      like pilot-fish to a shark, for what they could get by spongin&rsquo; on him,
      but real friends were scarce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the Lord sakes, Mother, don&rsquo;t keep sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;The boy,&rsquo; &lsquo;the boy,&rsquo; over
      and over again like a talkin&rsquo; machine! Let me finish about the father
      first. This Weis&mdash;er&mdash;thingamajig&mdash;the lawyer, had quite a
      talk with Speranza afore he died, or while he was dyin&rsquo;; he only lived a
      few hours after the accident and was out of his head part of that. But he
      said enough to let Weiss&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Oh, why CAN&rsquo;T I remember
      that Portygee&rsquo;s name?&mdash;to let him know that he&rsquo;d like to have him
      settle up what was left of his affairs, and to send word to us about&mdash;about
      the boy. There! I hope you feel easier, Mother; I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;round to &lsquo;the
      boy&rsquo; at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did he want word sent to us, Zelotes? He never wrote a line to us
      in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; bitterly; &ldquo;he knew better. Why did he want word sent
      now? The answer to that&rsquo;s easy enough. &lsquo;Cause he wanted to get somethin&rsquo; 
      out of us, that&rsquo;s the reason. From what that lawyer could gather, and from
      what he&rsquo;s found out since, there ain&rsquo;t money enough for the boy to stay
      another six weeks at that school, or anywhere else, unless the young
      feller earns it himself. And, leavin&rsquo; us out of the count, there isn&rsquo;t a
      relation this side of the salt pond. There&rsquo;s probably a million or so over
      there in Portygee-land,&rdquo; with a derisive sniff; &ldquo;those foreigners breed
      like flies. But THEY don&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But did he want word sent to us about the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you, Olive, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you. He wanted word sent
      because he was in hopes that we&mdash;you and I, Mother&mdash;would take
      that son of his in at our house here and give him a home. The cheek of it!
      After what he&rsquo;d done to you and me, blast him! The solid brass nerve of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stormed up and down the room. His wife did not seem nearly so much
      disturbed as he at the thought of the Speranza presumption. She looked
      anxious&mdash;yes, but she looked eager, too, and her gaze was fixed upon
      her husband&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Oh! . . . And&mdash;and what did you say,
      Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say? What do you suppose I said? I said no, and I said it good
      and loud, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive made no comment. She turned away her head, and the captain, who now
      in his turn was watching her, saw a suspicious gleam, as of moisture, on
      her cheek. He stopped his pacing and laid a hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Mother,&rdquo; he said, gently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; She turned pale. &ldquo;Comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy! . . . Sshh! shh!&rdquo; impatiently. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t go askin&rsquo; me
      questions or tellin&rsquo; me what I just said I said. I SAID the right thing,
      but&mdash;Well, hang it all, what else could I DO? I wrote the boy&mdash;Albert&mdash;a
      letter and I wrote the boss of the school another one. I sent a check
      along for expenses and&mdash;Well, he&rsquo;ll be here &lsquo;most any day now, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. And WHAT in the devil are we goin&rsquo; to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife did not reply to this outburst. She was trembling with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is his name Albert?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Seems so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s your middle name! Do you&mdash;do you s&rsquo;pose Janie could have
      named him for&mdash;for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; with some hesitation, &ldquo;it may be she didn&rsquo;t. If she&rsquo;d named
      him Zelotes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, woman! Isn&rsquo;t one name like that enough in the family? Thank
      the Lord we&rsquo;re spared two of &lsquo;em! But there! he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;. And when he gets
      here&mdash;then what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive put her arm about her big husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;m sure you did right, Zelotes, and that all&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; 
      to turn out to be for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? Well, <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t sure, not by a thousand fathom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Janie&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And he&rsquo;s that play-actor&rsquo;s boy, too. One Speranza pretty nigh ruined
      your life and mine, Olive. What&rsquo;ll this one do? . . . Well, God knows, I
      suppose likely, but He won&rsquo;t tell. All we can do is wait and see. I tell
      you honest I ain&rsquo;t very hopeful.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A brisk rap on the door; then a man&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, there! Wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert rolled over, opened one eye, then the other and raised himself on
      his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Wh-what?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock! Time to turn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was his grandfather&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, all right!&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand me, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, sir. I&rsquo;ll be right down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stairs creaked as Captain Zelotes descended them. Albert yawned
      cavernously, stretched and slid one foot out of bed. He drew it back
      instantly, however, for the sensation was that of having thrust it into a
      bucket of cold water. The room had been cold the previous evening; plainly
      it was colder still now. The temptation was to turn back and go to sleep
      again, but he fought against it. Somehow he had a feeling that to
      disregard his grandfather&rsquo;s summons would be poor diplomacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his teeth and, tossing back the bed clothes, jumped to the floor.
      Then he jumped again, for the floor was like ice. The window was wide open
      and he closed it, but there was no warm radiator to cuddle against while
      dressing. He missed his compulsory morning shower, a miss which did not
      distress him greatly. He shook himself into his clothes, soused his head
      and neck in a basin of ice water poured from a pitcher, and, before
      brushing his hair, looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sharp winter morning. The wind had gone down, but before
      subsiding it had blown every trace of mist or haze from the air, and from
      his window-sill to the horizon every detail was clean cut and distinct. He
      was looking out, it seemed, from the back of the house. The roof of the
      kitchen extension was below him and, to the right, the high roof of the
      barn. Over the kitchen roof and to the left he saw little rolling hills,
      valleys, cranberry swamps, a pond. A road wound in and out and, scattered
      along it, were houses, mostly white with green blinds, but occasionally
      varied by the gray of unpainted, weathered shingles. A long, low-spreading
      building a half mile off looked as if it might be a summer hotel, now
      closed and shuttered. Beyond it was a cluster of gray shanties and a gleam
      of water, evidently a wharf and a miniature harbor. And, beyond that, the
      deep, brilliant blue of the sea. Brown and blue were the prevailing
      colors, but, here and there, clumps and groves of pines gave splashes of
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an exhilaration in the crisp air. He felt an unwonted liveliness
      and a desire to be active which would have surprised some of his teachers
      at the school he had just left. The depression of spirits of which he had
      been conscious the previous night had disappeared along with his
      premonitions of unpleasantness. He felt optimistic this morning. After
      giving his curls a rake with the comb, he opened the door and descended
      the steep stairs to the lower floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandmother was setting the breakfast table. He was a little surprised
      to see her doing it. What was the use of having servants if one did the
      work oneself? But perhaps the housekeeper was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow, who had not heard him enter, turned and saw him. When he
      crossed the room, she kissed him on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope you slept well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert replied that he had slept very well indeed. He was a trifle
      disappointed that she made no comment on his promptness in answering his
      grandfather&rsquo;s summons. He felt such promptness deserved commendation. At
      school they rang two bells at ten minute intervals, thus giving a fellow a
      second chance. It had been a point of senior etiquette to accept nothing
      but that second chance. Here, apparently, he was expected to jump at the
      first. There was a matter of course about his grandmother&rsquo;s attitude which
      was disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on setting the table, talking as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real glad you did sleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some folks can hardly ever sleep
      the first night in a strange room. Zelotes&mdash;I mean your grandpa&mdash;&lsquo;s
      gone out to see to the horse and feed the hens and the pig. He&rsquo;ll be in
      pretty soon. Then we&rsquo;ll have breakfast. I suppose you&rsquo;re awful hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact he was not very hungry. Breakfast was always a more or
      less perfunctory meal with him. But he was surprised to see the variety of
      eatables upon that table. There were cookies there, and doughnuts, and
      even half an apple pie. Pie for breakfast! It had been a newspaper joke at
      which he had laughed many times. But it seemed not to be a joke here,
      rather a solemn reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen door opened and Mrs. Ellis put in her head. To Albert&rsquo;s
      astonishment the upper part of the head, beginning just above the brows,
      was swathed in a huge bandage. The lower part was a picture of hopeless
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Cap&rsquo;n Lote come in yet?&rdquo; inquired the housekeeper, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, Rachel,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be here in a minute, though.
      Albert&rsquo;s down, so you can begin takin&rsquo; up the things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head disappeared. A sigh of complete wretchedness drifted in as the
      door closed. Albert looked at his grandmother in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she sick?&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Rachel? No, she ain&rsquo;t exactly sick . . . Dear me! Where did I put
      that clean napkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared at the kitchen door. If his grandmother had said the
      housekeeper was not exactly dead he might have understood. But to say she
      was not exactly sick&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but what makes her look so?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;And&mdash;and
      what&rsquo;s she got that on her head for? And she groaned! Why, she MUST be
      sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow, having found the clean napkin, laid it beside her husband&rsquo;s
      plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of her sympathetic attacks; that&rsquo;s what
      she calls &lsquo;em, sympathetic attacks. She has &lsquo;em every time Laban Keeler
      starts in on one of his periodics. It&rsquo;s nerves, I suppose. Cap&rsquo;n Zelotes&mdash;your
      grandfather&mdash;says it&rsquo;s everlastin&rsquo; foolishness. Whatever &lsquo;tis, it&rsquo;s a
      nuisance. And she&rsquo;s so sensible other times, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was more puzzled than ever. Why in the world Mrs. Ellis should tie
      up her head and groan because the little Keeler person had gone on a spree
      was beyond his comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandmother enlightened him a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;she and Laban have been engaged to be married
      ever since they were young folks. It&rsquo;s Laban&rsquo;s weakness for liquor that&rsquo;s
      kept &lsquo;em apart so long. She won&rsquo;t marry him while he drinks and he keeps
      swearin&rsquo; off and then breaking down. He&rsquo;s a good man, too; an awful good
      man and capable as all get-out when he&rsquo;s sober. Lately that is, for the
      last seven or eight years, beginnin&rsquo; with the time when that lecturer on
      mesmerism and telegraphy&mdash;no, telepathy&mdash;thought-transfers and
      such&mdash;was at the town hall&mdash;Rachel has been havin&rsquo; these
      sympathetic attacks of hers. She declares that alcohol-takin&rsquo; is a disease
      and that Laban suffers when he&rsquo;s tipsy and that she and he are so bound up
      together that she suffers just the same as he does. I must say I never
      noticed him sufferin&rsquo; very much, not at the beginnin,&rsquo; anyhow&mdash;acts
      more as he was havin&rsquo; a good time&mdash;but she seems to. I don&rsquo;t wonder
      you smile,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis funny, in a way, and it&rsquo;s queer that such a
      practical, common-sense woman as Rachel Ellis is, should have such a
      notion. It&rsquo;s hard on us, though. Don&rsquo;t say anything to her about it, and
      don&rsquo;t laugh at her, whatever you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert wanted to laugh very much. &ldquo;But, Mrs. Snow&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy sakes alive! You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to call me &lsquo;Mrs. Snow,&rsquo; I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not. But, Grandmother why do you and Captain&mdash;you and
      Grandfather keep her and Keeler if they are so much trouble? Why don&rsquo;t you
      let them go and get someone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em go? Get someone else! Why, we COULDN&rsquo;T get anybody else, anyone
      who would be like them. They&rsquo;re almost a part of our family; that is,
      Rachel is, she&rsquo;s been here since goodness knows when. And, when he&rsquo;s sober
      Laban almost runs the lumber business. Besides, they&rsquo;re nice folks&mdash;almost
      always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Plainly the ways of South Harniss were not the ways of the world he had
      known. Certainly these people were &ldquo;Rubes&rdquo; and queer Rubes, too. Then he
      remembered that two of them were his grandparents and that his immediate
      future was, so to speak, in their hands. The thought was not entirely
      comforting or delightful. He was still pondering upon it when his
      grandfather came in from the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain said good morning in the same way he had said good night, that
      is, he and Albert shook hands and the boy was again conscious of the gaze
      which took him in from head to foot and of the quiet twinkle in the gray
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep well, son?&rdquo; inquired Captain Zelotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes . . . Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. I judged you was makin&rsquo; a pretty good try at it when I
      thumped on your door this mornin&rsquo;. Somethin&rsquo; new for you to be turned out
      at seven, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? It wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. The rising bell rang at seven up at school. We were supposed to
      be down at breakfast at a quarter past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You were, eh? Supposed to be? Does that mean that you were there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a surprised look in the gray eyes now, a fact which Albert
      noticed with inward delight. He had taken one &ldquo;rise&rdquo; out of his
      grandfather, at any rate. He waited, hoping for another opportunity, but
      it did not come. Instead they sat down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast, in spite of the morning sunshine at the windows, was somewhat
      gloomy. The homesickness, although not as acute as on the previous night,
      was still in evidence. Albert felt lost, out of his element, lonely. And,
      to add a touch of real miserableness, the housekeeper served and ate like
      a near relative of the deceased at a funeral feast. She moved slowly, she
      sighed heavily, and the bandage upon her forehead loomed large and
      portentous. When spoken to she seldom replied before the third attempt.
      Captain Zelotes lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have another egg?&rdquo; he roared, brandishing the spoon containing it at
      arm&rsquo;s length and almost under her nose. &ldquo;Egg! Egg! EGG! If you can&rsquo;t hear
      it, smell it. Only answer, for heaven sakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this outburst was obviously not what he had hoped. Mrs.
      Ellis stared first at the egg quivering before her face, then at the
      captain. Then she rose and marched majestically to the kitchen. The door
      closed, but a heartrending sniff drifted in through the crack. Olive laid
      down her knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, despairingly. &ldquo;Now see what you&rsquo;ve done. Oh,
      Zelotes, how many times have I told you you&rsquo;ve got to treat her tactful
      when she&rsquo;s this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote put the egg back in the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DAMN!&rdquo; he observed, with intense enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swearin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t help it a mite, either,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Besides I don&rsquo;t
      know what Albert here must think of you.&rdquo; Albert, who, between
      astonishment and a wild desire to laugh, was in a critical condition,
      appeared rather embarrassed. His grandfather looked at him and smiled
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late one damn won&rsquo;t scare him to death,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s
      heard somethin&rsquo; like it afore. Or do they say, &lsquo;Oh, sugar!&rsquo; up at that
      school you come from?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert, not knowing how to reply, looked more embarrassed than ever. Olive
      seemed on the point of weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Zelotes, how CAN you!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;And to-day, of all days! His very
      first mornin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote relented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Mother!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Forget it. Sorry if I shocked
      you, Albert. There&rsquo;s times when salt-water language is the only thing that
      seems to help me out . . . Well, Mother, what next? What&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know just as well as I do, Zelotes. There&rsquo;s only one thing you can
      do. That&rsquo;s go out and beg her pardon this minute. There&rsquo;s a dozen places
      she could get right here in South Harniss without turnin&rsquo; her hand over.
      And if she should leave I don&rsquo;t know WHAT I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave! She ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to leave any more&rsquo;n than the ship&rsquo;s cat&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      jump overboard. She&rsquo;s been here so long she wouldn&rsquo;t know how to leave if
      she wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t make any difference. The pitcher that goes to the well&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had evidently forgotten the rest of the proverb. Her husband helped
      her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flocks together or gathers no moss, or somethin&rsquo;, eh? All right, Mother,
      don&rsquo;t fret. There ain&rsquo;t really any occasion to, considerin&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve been
      through somethin&rsquo; like this at least once every six months for ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes, won&rsquo;t you PLEASE go and ask her pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain pushed back his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged if it ain&rsquo;t a healthy
      note,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;when the skipper has to go and apologize to the cook
      because the cook&rsquo;s made a fool of herself! I&rsquo;d like to know what kind of
      rum Labe drinks. I never saw any but his kind that would go to somebody
      else&rsquo;s head. Two people gettin&rsquo; tight and only one of &lsquo;em drinkin&rsquo; is
      somethin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared into the kitchen, still muttering. Mrs. Snow smiled feebly
      at her grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you think we&rsquo;re funny folks, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But Rachel is
      one hired help in a thousand and she has to be treated just so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later Cap&rsquo;n &lsquo;Lote returned. He shrugged his shoulders and sat
      down at his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mother, all right,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been heavin&rsquo; ile on the
      troubled waters and the sea&rsquo;s smoothin&rsquo; down. She&rsquo;ll be kind and
      condescendin&rsquo; enough to eat with us in a minute or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was. She came into the dining-room with the air of a saint going to
      martyrdom and the remainder of the meal was eaten by the quartet almost in
      silence. When it was over the captain said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Al, feel like walkin&rsquo;, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, yes, sir, I guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You don&rsquo;t seem very wild at the prospect. Walkin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t much in
      your line, maybe. More used to autoin&rsquo;, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow put in a word. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, Zelotes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think
      you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; fun of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Me? Not a bit of it. Well, Al, do you want to walk down to the
      lumber yard with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy hesitated. The quiet note of sarcasm in his grandfather&rsquo;s voice
      was making him furiously angry once more, just as it had done on the
      previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to?&rdquo; he asked, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I cal&rsquo;late I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, without another word, walked to the hat-rack in the hall and began
      putting on his coat. Captain Lote watched him for a moment and then put on
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back to dinner, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Heave ahead, Al, if you&rsquo;re
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was little conversation between the pair during the half mile walk
      to the office and yards of &ldquo;Z. Snow and Co., Lumber and Builders&rsquo; 
      Hardware.&rdquo; Only once did the captain offer a remark. That was just as they
      came out by the big posts at the entrance to the driveway. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al, I don&rsquo;t want you to get the idea from what happened at the table just
      now&mdash;that foolishness about Rachel Ellis&mdash;that your grandmother
      ain&rsquo;t a sensible woman. She is, and there&rsquo;s no better one on earth. Don&rsquo;t
      let that fact slip your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, somewhat startled by the abruptness of the observation, looked up
      in surprise. He found the gray eyes looking down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed you lookin&rsquo; at her,&rdquo; went on his grandfather, &ldquo;as if you was
      kind of wonderin&rsquo; whether to laugh at her or pity her. You needn&rsquo;t do
      either. She&rsquo;s kind-hearted and that makes her put up with Rachel&rsquo;s
      silliness. Then, besides, Rachel herself is common sense and practical
      nine-tenths of the time. It&rsquo;s always a good idea, son, to sail one v&rsquo;yage
      along with a person before you decide whether to class &lsquo;em as A. B. or
      just roustabout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed to the boy&rsquo;s face. He felt guilty and the feeling made
      him angrier than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; he burst out, indignantly, &ldquo;you should say I was
      laughing at&mdash;at Mrs. Snow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;at my grandmother. I don&rsquo;t see why you should say
      that. I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t you? Good! I&rsquo;m glad of it. I wouldn&rsquo;t, anyhow. She&rsquo;s liable to be
      about the best friend you&rsquo;ll have in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Albert&rsquo;s mind flashed the addition: &ldquo;Better than you, that means,&rdquo; but
      he kept it to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber yards were on a spur track not very far from the railway
      station where he had spent that miserable half hour the previous evening.
      The darkness then had prevented his seeing them. Not that he would have
      been greatly interested if he had seen them, nor was he more interested
      now, although his grandfather took him on a personally conducted tour
      between the piles of spruce and pine and hemlock and pointed out which was
      which and added further details. &ldquo;Those are two by fours,&rdquo; he said. Or,
      &ldquo;Those are larger joist, different sizes.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is good, clear stock, as
      good a lot of white pine as we&rsquo;ve got hold of for a long spell.&rdquo; He gave
      particulars concerning the &ldquo;handiest way to drive a team&rdquo; to one or the
      other of the piles. Albert found it rather boring. He longed to speak
      concerning enormous lumber yards he had seen in New York or Chicago or
      elsewhere. He felt almost a pitying condescension toward this provincial
      grandparent who seemed to think his little piles of &ldquo;two by fours&rdquo; so
      important.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was much the same, perhaps a little worse, when they entered the
      hardware shop and the office. The rows and rows of little drawers and
      boxes, each with samples of its contents&mdash;screws, or bolts, or hooks,
      or knobs&mdash;affixed to its front, were even more boring than the lumber
      piles. There was a countryfied, middle-aged person in overalls sweeping
      out the shop and Captain Zelotes introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is Mr. Issachar Price, who works around the place
      here. Issy, let me make you acquainted with my grandson, Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price, looking over his spectacles, extended a horny hand and
      observed: &ldquo;Yus, yus. Pleased to meet you, Albert. I&rsquo;ve heard tell of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s private appraisal of &ldquo;Issy&rdquo; was that the latter was another funny
      Rube. Whatever Issy&rsquo;s estimate of his employer&rsquo;s grandson might have been,
      he, also, kept it to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes looked about the shop and glanced into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;No sign or symptoms of Laban this mornin&rsquo;, I presume
      likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar went on with his sweeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary one,&rdquo; was his laconic reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Heard anything about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price moistened his broom in a bucket of water. &ldquo;I see Tim Kelley on
      my way down street,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tim said he run afoul of Laban along about
      ten last night. Said he cal&rsquo;lated Labe was on his way. He was singin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Hyannis on the Cape&rsquo; and so Tim figgered he&rsquo;d got a pretty fair start
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shook his head. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Well, that
      means I&rsquo;ll have to do office work for the next week or so. Humph! I
      declare it&rsquo;s too bad just now when I was countin&rsquo; on him to&mdash;&rdquo; He did
      not finish the sentence, but instead turned to his grandson and said: &ldquo;Al,
      why don&rsquo;t you look around the hardware store here while I open the mail
      and the safe. If there&rsquo;s anything you see you don&rsquo;t understand Issy&rsquo;ll
      tell you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the office. Albert sauntered listlessly to the window and
      looked out. So far as not understanding anything in the shop was concerned
      he was quite willing to remain in ignorance. It did not interest him in
      the least. A moment later he felt a touch on his elbow. He turned, to find
      Mr. Price standing beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all ready to tell you about it now,&rdquo; volunteered the unsmiling Issy.
      &ldquo;Sweepin&rsquo;s all finished up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was amused. &ldquo;I guess I can get along,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t worried none. I don&rsquo;t believe in worryin&rsquo;; worryin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
      do folks no good, the way I look at it. But long&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Lote wants me to
      tell you about the hardware I&rsquo;d ruther do it now, than any time. Henry
      Cahoon&rsquo;s team&rsquo;ll be here for a load of lath in about ten minutes or so,
      and then I&rsquo;ll have to leave you. This here&rsquo;s the shelf where we keep the
      butts&mdash;hinges, you understand. Brass along here, and iron here. Got
      quite a stock, ain&rsquo;t we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the visitor&rsquo;s arm in his mighty paw and led him from shelves to
      drawers and from drawers to boxes, talking all the time, so the boy
      thought, &ldquo;like a catalogue.&rdquo; Albert tried gently to break away several
      times and yawned often, but yawns and hints were quite lost on his guide,
      who was intent only upon the business&mdash;and victim&mdash;in hand. At
      the window looking across toward the main road Albert paused longest.
      There was a girl in sight&mdash;she looked, at that distance, as if she
      might be a rather pretty girl&mdash;and the young man was languidly
      interested. He had recently made the discovery that pretty girls may be
      quite interesting; and, moreover, one or two of them whom he had met at
      the school dances&mdash;when the young ladies from the Misses Bradshaws&rsquo; 
      seminary had come over, duly guarded and chaperoned, to one-step and
      fox-trot with the young gentlemen of the school&mdash;one or two of these
      young ladies had intimated a certain interest in him. So the feminine
      possibility across the road attracted his notice&mdash;only slightly, of
      course; the sophisticated metropolitan notice is not easily aroused&mdash;but
      still, slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, come on,&rdquo; urged Issachar Price. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t begun to show ye the
      whole of it yet . . . Eh? Oh, Lord, there comes Cahoon&rsquo;s team now! Well, I
      got to go. Show you the rest some other time. So long . . . Eh? Cap&rsquo;n
      Lote&rsquo;s callin&rsquo; you, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert went into the office in response to his grandfather&rsquo;s call to find
      the latter seated at an old-fashioned roll-top desk, piled with papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go down to the bank, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some business about a
      note that Laban ought to be here to see to, but ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll be back pretty
      soon. You just stay here and wait for me. You might be lookin&rsquo; over the
      books, if you want to. I took &lsquo;em out of the safe and they&rsquo;re on Labe&rsquo;s
      desk there,&rdquo; pointing to the high standing desk by the window. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      worth lookin&rsquo; at, if only to see how neat they&rsquo;re kept. A set of books
      like that is an example to any young man. You might be lookin&rsquo; &lsquo;em over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out. Albert smiled condescendingly and, instead of looking over
      Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s books, walked over to the window and looked out of that. The
      girl was not in sight now, but she might be soon. At any rate watching for
      her was as exciting as any amusement he could think of about that dull
      hole. Ah hum! he wondered how the fellows were at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not reappear. Signs of animation along the main road were
      limited. One or two men went by, then a group of children obviously on
      their way to school. Albert yawned again, took the silver cigarette case
      from his pocket and looked longingly at its contents. He wondered what his
      grandfather&rsquo;s ideas might be on the tobacco question. But his grandfather
      was not there then . . . and he might not return for some time . . . and .
      . . He took a cigarette from the case, tapped, with careful carelessness,
      its end upon the case&mdash;he would not have dreamed of smoking without
      first going through the tapping process&mdash;lighted the cigarette and
      blew a large and satisfying cloud. Between puffs he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      &ldquo;To you, beautiful lady,
       I raise my eyes.
     My heart, beautiful lady,
       To your heart cries:
     Come, come, beautiful lady,
       To Par-a-dise,
     As the sweet, sweet&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Some one behind him said: &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; The appeal to the beautiful lady
      broke off in the middle, and he whirled about to find the girl whom he had
      seen across the road and for whose reappearance he had been watching at
      the window, standing in the office doorway. He looked at her and she
      looked at him. He was embarrassed. She did not seem to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Is Mr. Keeler here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a pretty girl, so his hasty estimate made when he had first
      sighted her was correct. Her hair was dark, so were her eyes, and her
      cheeks were becomingly colored by the chill of the winter air. She was a
      country girl, her hat and coat proved that; not that they were in bad
      taste or unbecoming, but they were simple and their style perhaps nearer
      to that which the young ladies of the Misses Bradshaws&rsquo; seminary had worn
      the previous winter. All this Albert noticed in detail later on. Just then
      the particular point which attracted his embarrassed attention was the
      look in the dark eyes. They seemed to have almost the same disturbing
      quality which he had noticed in his grandfather&rsquo;s gray ones. Her mouth was
      very proper and grave, but her eyes looked as if she were laughing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to be laughed at by an attractive young lady is disturbing and
      unpleasant. It is particularly so when the laughter is from the provinces
      and the laughee&mdash;so to speak&mdash;a dignified and sophisticated city
      man. Albert summoned the said dignity and sophistication to his rescue,
      knocked the ashes from his cigarette and said, haughtily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Keeler here?&rdquo; repeated the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he be back soon, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Recollections of Mr. Price&rsquo;s recent remark concerning the missing
      bookkeeper&rsquo;s &ldquo;good start&rdquo; came to Albert&rsquo;s mind and he smiled, slightly.
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; he observed, with delicate irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Issy&mdash;I mean Mr. Price, busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out in the yard there somewhere, I believe. Would you like to have
      me call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;if you please&mdash;sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;sir&rdquo; was flattering, if it was sincere. He glanced at her. The
      expression of the mouth was as grave as ever, but he was still uncertain
      about those eyes. However, he was disposed to give her the benefit of the
      doubt, so, stepping to the side door of the office&mdash;that leading to
      the yards&mdash;he opened it and shouted: &ldquo;Price! . . . Hey, Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer, although he could hear Issachar&rsquo;s voice and another
      above the rattle of lath bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price!&rdquo; he shouted, again. &ldquo;Pri-i-ce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rattling ceased. Then, in the middle distance, above a pile of &ldquo;two by
      fours,&rdquo; appeared Issachar&rsquo;s head, the features agitated and the forehead
      bedewed with the moisture of honest toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; yelled Issy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Be you hollerin&rsquo; to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There&rsquo;s some one here wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say there&rsquo;s some one here who wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, find out, can&rsquo;t ye? I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was that a laugh which Albert heard behind him? He turned around, but the
      young lady&rsquo;s face wore the same grave, even demure, expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to see him for?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to buy something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to buy something,&rdquo; repeated Albert, shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants to&mdash;BUY&mdash;something.&rdquo; It was humiliating to have to
      scream in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy? Buy what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to buy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hook, that&rsquo;s all. A hook for our kitchen door. Would you mind asking
      him to hurry? I haven&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants a hook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? We don&rsquo;t keep books. What kind of a book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not book&mdash;HOOK. H-O-O-K! Oh, great Scott! Hook! HOOK! Hook for a
      door! And she wants you to hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Well, I can&rsquo;t hurry now for nobody. I got to load these laths and
      that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Can&rsquo;t you wait on him?&rdquo; Evidently the
      customer&rsquo;s sex had not yet been made clear to the Price understanding.
      &ldquo;You can get a hook for him, can&rsquo;t ye? You know where they be, I showed
      ye. Ain&rsquo;t forgot so soon, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head disappeared behind the &ldquo;two by fours.&rdquo; Its face was red, but no
      redder than Mr. Speranza&rsquo;s at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool rube!&rdquo; he snorted, disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, but you&rsquo;ve dropped your cigarette,&rdquo; observed the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert savagely slammed down the window and turned away. The dropped
      cigarette stump lay where it had fallen, smudging and smelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      His caller looked at it and then at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d pick it up, if I were you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Snow HATES cigarettes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, his dignity and indignation forgotten, returned her look with one
      of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he, honest?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He hates them worse than anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cigarette stump was hastily picked up by its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I put it?&rdquo; he asked, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t put it in your pocket! It will set you on
      fire. Put it in the stove, quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into the stove it went, all but its fragrance, which lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you COULD find me that hook?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know anything about the confounded things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; innocently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course I don&rsquo;t. Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you working here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here? Work HERE? ME? Well, I&mdash;should&mdash;say&mdash;NOT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, excuse me. I thought you must be a new bookkeeper, or&mdash;or a new
      partner, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert regarded her intently and suspiciously for some seconds before
      making another remark. She was as demurely grave as ever, but his
      suspicions were again aroused. However, she WAS pretty, there could be no
      doubt about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I can find the hook for you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can try, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you ever so much,&rdquo; gratefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s VERY kind of you to take
      so much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; airily, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all right. Come on; perhaps we can find it
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were still looking when Mr. Price came panting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he observed, with emphasis. &ldquo;If anybody tells you heavin&rsquo; bundles
      of laths aboard a truck-wagon ain&rsquo;t hard work you tell him for me he&rsquo;s a
      liar, will ye. Whew! And I had to do the heft of everything, &lsquo;cause Cahoon
      sent that one-armed nephew of his to drive the team. A healthy lot of good
      a one-armed man is to help heave lumber! I says to him, says I: &lsquo;What in
      time did&mdash;&rsquo; Eh? Why, hello, Helen! Good mornin&rsquo;. Land sakes! you&rsquo;re
      out airly, ain&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady nodded. &ldquo;Good morning, Issachar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, I am
      pretty early and I&rsquo;m in a dreadful hurry. The wind blew our kitchen door
      back against the house last night and broke the hook. I promised Father I
      would run over here and get him a new one and bring it back to him before
      I went to school. And it&rsquo;s quarter to nine now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sakes, so &lsquo;tis! Ain&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;Albert
      here, found it for you yet? He ain&rsquo;t no kind of a hand to find things, is
      he? We&rsquo;ll have to larn him better&rsquo;n that. Yes indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed, sarcastically. He was about to make a satisfyingly
      crushing reproof to this piece of impertinence when Mr. Price began to
      sniff the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in tunket?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Sn&rsquo;f! Sn&rsquo;f! Who&rsquo;s been smokin&rsquo; in here?
      And cigarettes, too, by crimus! Sn&rsquo;f! Sn&rsquo;f! Yes, sir, cigarettes, by
      crimustee! Who&rsquo;s been smokin&rsquo; cigarettes in here? If Cap&rsquo;n Lote knew
      anybody&rsquo;d smoked a cigarette in here I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he wouldn&rsquo;t kill &lsquo;em.
      Who done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shivered. The girl with the dark blue eyes flashed a quick glance
      at him. &ldquo;I think perhaps someone went by the window when it was open just
      now,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Perhaps they were smoking and the smoke blew in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Well, maybe so. Must have been a mighty rank cigarette to smell up
      the whole premises like this just goin&rsquo; past a window. Whew! Gosh! no
      wonder they say them things are rank pison. I&rsquo;d sooner smoke skunk-cabbage
      myself; &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t smell no worse and &lsquo;twould be a dum sight safer. Whew!
      . . . Well, Helen, there&rsquo;s about the kind of hook I cal&rsquo;late you need.
      Fifteen cents &lsquo;ll let you out on that. Cheap enough for half the money,
      eh? Give my respects to your pa, will ye. Tell him that sermon he preached
      last Sunday was fine, but I&rsquo;d like it better if he&rsquo;d laid it on to the
      Univer&rsquo;lists a little harder. Folks that don&rsquo;t believe in hell don&rsquo;t
      deserve no consideration, &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to my notion. So long, Helen . . . Oh
      say,&rdquo; he added, as an afterthought, &ldquo;I guess you and Albert ain&rsquo;t been
      introduced, have ye? Albert, this is Helen Kendall, she&rsquo;s our Orthodox
      minister&rsquo;s daughter. Helen, this young feller is Albert&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Consarn
      it, I&rsquo;ve asked Cap&rsquo;n Lote that name a dozen times if I have once! What is
      it, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speranza,&rdquo; replied the owner of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Sperandy. This is Albert Sperandy, Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert and Miss Kendall shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the former, gratefully and significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I knew who you were all the time&mdash;or
      I guessed who you must be. Cap&rsquo;n Snow told me you were coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went out. Issachar, staring after her, chuckled admiringly. &ldquo;Smartest
      girl in THIS town,&rdquo; he observed, with emphasis. &ldquo;Head of her class up to
      high school and only sixteen and three-quarters at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes came bustling in a few minutes later. He went to his desk,
      paying little attention to his grandson. The latter loitered idly up and
      down the office and hardware shop, watching Issachar wait on customers or
      rush shouting into the yard to attend to the wants of others there.
      Plainly this was Issachar&rsquo;s busy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crimus!&rdquo; he exclaimed, returning from one such excursion and mopping his
      forehead. &ldquo;This doin&rsquo; two men&rsquo;s work ain&rsquo;t no fun. Every time Labe goes on
      a time seem&rsquo;s if trade was brisker&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s been for a month. Seems as if
      all creation and part of East Harniss had been hangin&rsquo; back waitin&rsquo; till
      he had a shade on &lsquo;fore they come to trade. Makes a feller feel like
      votin&rsquo; the Prohibition ticket. I WOULD vote it, by crimustee, if I thought
      &lsquo;twould do any good. &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t though; Labe would take to drinkin&rsquo; bay
      rum or Florida water or somethin&rsquo;, same as Hoppy Rogers done when he was
      alive. Jim Young says he went into Hoppy&rsquo;s barber-shop once and there was
      Hoppy with a bottle of a new kind of hair-tonic in his hand. &lsquo;Drummer that
      was here left it for a sample,&rsquo; says Hoppy. &lsquo;Wanted me to try it and, if I
      liked it, he cal&rsquo;lated maybe I&rsquo;d buy some. I don&rsquo;t think I shall, though,&rsquo; 
      he says; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t taste right to me.&rsquo; Yes, sir, Jim Young swears that&rsquo;s
      true. Wan&rsquo;t enough snake-killer in that hair tonic to suit Hoppy. I&mdash;Yes,
      Cap&rsquo;n Lote, what is it? Want me, do ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the captain did not, as it happened, want Mr. Price at that time. It
      was Albert whose name he had called. The boy went into the office and his
      grandfather rose and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Al,&rdquo; he said, motioning toward a chair. When his grandson had
      seated himself Captain Zelotes tilted back his own desk chair upon its
      springs and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, son,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it? I don&rsquo;t know exactly what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the place here. Shop, yards, the whole business. Z. Snow and Company&mdash;what
      do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Privately Albert was inclined to classify the entire outfit as one-horse
      and countrified, but he deemed it wiser not to express this opinion. So he
      compromised and replied that it &ldquo;seemed to be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather nodded. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he observed, dryly. &ldquo;Glad you find it
      that way. Well, then, changin&rsquo; the subject for a minute or two, what do
      you think about yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About myself? About me? I don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you do. That&rsquo;s what I got you over here this mornin&rsquo; 
      for, so as we could understand&mdash;you and me. Al, have you given any
      thought to what you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do from this on? How you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
      live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at him uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I&rsquo;m going to live?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I thought&mdash;I
      supposed I was going to live with you&mdash;with you and Grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just kind of took that for granted, I guess. You sent for me to come
      here. You took me away from school, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I did. You know why I took you from school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I guess I DON&rsquo;T, exactly. I thought&mdash;I supposed it was
      because you didn&rsquo;t want me to go there any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t that. I don&rsquo;t know whether I would have wanted you to go there
      or not if things had been different. From what I hear it was a pretty
      extravagant place, and lookin&rsquo; at it from the outside without knowin&rsquo; too
      much about it, I should say it was liable to put a lot of foolish and
      expensive notions into a boy&rsquo;s head. I may be wrong, of course; I have
      been wrong at least a few times in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that he considered the chances of his being wrong in this
      instance very remote. His tone again aroused in the youth the feeling of
      obstinacy, of rebellion, of desire to take the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is one of the best schools in this country,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;My father
      said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes picked up a pencil on his desk and tapped his chin lightly
      with the blunt end. &ldquo;Um,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Well, I presume likely he knew all
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knew as much as&mdash;most people,&rdquo; with a slight but significant
      hesitation before the &ldquo;most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Naturally, havin&rsquo; been schooled there himself, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t schooled there. My father was a Spaniard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard. . . . Well, we&rsquo;re kind of off the subject, ain&rsquo;t we? Let&rsquo;s
      leave your father&rsquo;s nationality out of it for a while. And we&rsquo;ll leave the
      school, too, because no matter if it was the best one on earth you
      couldn&rsquo;t go there. I shouldn&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;twas right to spend as much money as
      that at any school, and you&mdash;well, son, you ain&rsquo;t got it to spend.
      Did you have any idea what your father left you, in the way of tangible
      assets?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I knew he had plenty of money always. He was one of the most famous
      singers in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It WAS so,&rdquo; hotly. &ldquo;And he was paid enough in one week to buy this whole
      town&mdash;or almost. Why, my father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! Sssh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to hush. I&rsquo;m proud of my father. He was a&mdash;a great
      man. And&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not going to stand here and have you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between indignation and emotion he choked and could not finish the
      sentence. The tears came to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have you or anyone else talk about him that way,&rdquo; he
      concluded, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather regarded him with a steady, but not at all unkindly, gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t runnin&rsquo; down your father, Albert,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are. You hated him. Anybody could see you hated him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain slowly rapped the desk with the pencil. He did not answer at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I ought to deny that. I
      don&rsquo;t know as I can deny it and be honest. Years ago he took away from me
      what amounted to three-quarters of everything that made my life worth
      while. Some day you&rsquo;ll know more about it than you do now, and maybe
      you&rsquo;ll understand my p&rsquo;int of view better. No, I didn&rsquo;t like your father&mdash;Eh?
      What was you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, who had muttered something, was rather confused. However, he did
      not attempt to equivocate. &ldquo;I said I guessed that didn&rsquo;t make much
      difference to Father,&rdquo; he answered, sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume likely it didn&rsquo;t. But we won&rsquo;t go into that question now. What
      I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to get at in this talk we&rsquo;re having is you and your future. Now
      you can&rsquo;t go back to school because you can&rsquo;t afford it. All your father
      left when he died was&mdash;this is the honest truth I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you now,
      and if I&rsquo;m puttin&rsquo; it pretty blunt it&rsquo;s because I always think it&rsquo;s best
      to get a bad mess out of the way in a hurry&mdash;all your father left was
      debts. He didn&rsquo;t leave money enough to bury him, hardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy stared at him aghast. His grandfather, leaning a little toward
      him, would have put a hand on his knee, but the knee was jerked out of the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s over, Al,&rdquo; went on Captain Zelotes. &ldquo;You know the worst now
      and you can say, &lsquo;What of it?&rsquo; I mean just that: What of it? Bein&rsquo; left
      without a cent, but with your health and a fair chance to make good&mdash;that,
      at seventeen or eighteen ain&rsquo;t a bad lookout, by any manner of means. It&rsquo;s
      the outlook <i>I</i> had at fifteen&mdash;exceptin&rsquo; the chance&mdash;and I
      ain&rsquo;t asked many favors of anybody since. At your age, or a month or two
      older, do you know where I was? I was first mate of a three-masted
      schooner. At twenty I was skipper; and at twenty-five, by the Almighty, I
      owned a share in her. Al, all you need now is a chance to go to work. And
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you that chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert gasped. &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;do you mean I&rsquo;ve got to be a&mdash;a
      sailor?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes put back his head and laughed, laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailor!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ho, ho! No wonder you looked scared. No, I wan&rsquo;t
      cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to make a sailor out of you, son. For one reason, sailorin&rsquo; 
      ain&rsquo;t what it used to be; and, for another, I have my doubts whether a
      young feller of your bringin&rsquo; up would make much of a go handlin&rsquo; a bunch
      of fo&rsquo;mast hands the first day out. No, I wasn&rsquo;t figgerin&rsquo; to send you to
      sea . . . What do you suppose I brought you down to this place for this
      mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Albert understood. He knew why he had been conducted through the
      lumber yards, about the hardware shop, why his grandfather and Mr. Price
      had taken so much pains to exhibit and explain. His heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought you down here,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s a
      first-rate idea to look a vessel over afore you ship aboard her. It&rsquo;s kind
      of late to back out after you have shipped. Ever since I made up my mind
      to send for you and have you live along with your grandmother and me I&rsquo;ve
      been plannin&rsquo; what to do with you. I knew, if you was a decent, ambitious
      young chap, you&rsquo;d want to do somethin&rsquo; towards makin&rsquo; a start in life. We
      can use&mdash;that is, this business can use that kind of a chap right
      now. He could larn to keep books and know lumber and hardware and how to
      sell and how to buy. He can larn the whole thing. There&rsquo;s a chance here,
      son. It&rsquo;s your chance; I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; it to you. How big a chance it turns out
      to be &lsquo;ll depend on you, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Albert was silent. His thoughts were confused, but out of
      their dismayed confusion two or three fixed ideas reared themselves like
      crags from a whirlpool. He was to live in South Hamiss always&mdash;always;
      he was to keep books&mdash;Heavens, how he hated mathematics, detail work
      of any kind!&mdash;for drunken old Keeler; he was to &ldquo;heave lumber&rdquo; with
      Issy Price. He&mdash;Oh, it was dreadful! It was horrible. He couldn&rsquo;t! He
      wouldn&rsquo;t! He&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes had been watching him, his heavy brows drawing closer
      together as the boy delayed answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, for another minute. &ldquo;Did you hear what I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understood, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was clutching at straws. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to keep books,&rdquo;
       he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you did. Don&rsquo;t imagine they teach anything as practical
      as bookkeepin&rsquo; up at that school of yours. But you can larn, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so, too. Good Lord, I HOPE so! Humph! You don&rsquo;t seem to be
      jumpin&rsquo; for joy over the prospect. There&rsquo;s a half dozen smart young
      fellers here in South Harniss that would, I tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert devoutly wished they had jumped&mdash;and landed&mdash;before his
      arrival. His grandfather&rsquo;s tone grew more brusque.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to work?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I&mdash;I suppose I do. I&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t thought much about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Then I think it&rsquo;s time you begun. Hadn&rsquo;t you had ANY notion of
      what you wanted to do when you got out of that school of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! . . . Yes, I presume likely. Well, after you got out of college,
      what was you plannin&rsquo; to do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure. I thought I might do something with my music. I can play a
      little. I can&rsquo;t sing&mdash;that is, not well enough. If I could,&rdquo;
       wistfully, &ldquo;I should have liked to be in opera, as father was, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes&rsquo; only comment was a sniff or snort, or combination of
      both. Albert went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought of writing&mdash;writing books and poems, you know. I&rsquo;ve
      written quite a good deal for the school magazine. And I think I should
      like to be an actor, perhaps. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; His grandfather&rsquo;s fist came down upon the desk before him.
      Slowly he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&mdash;a poetry writer and an actor!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Whew! . . . Well,
      there! Perhaps maybe we hadn&rsquo;t better talk any more just now. You can have
      the rest of the day to run around town and sort of get acquainted, if you
      want to. Then to-morrow mornin&rsquo; you and I&rsquo;ll come over here together and
      we&rsquo;ll begin to break you in. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he added, dryly, &ldquo;if you
      found it kind of dull at first&mdash;compared to that school and poetry
      makin&rsquo; and such&mdash;but it&rsquo;ll be respectable and it&rsquo;ll pay for board and
      clothes and somethin&rsquo; to eat once in a while, which may not seem so
      important to you now as &lsquo;twill later on. And some day I cal&rsquo;late&mdash;anyhow
      we&rsquo;ll hope&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be mighty glad you did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Albert looked and felt anything but glad just then. Captain Zelotes,
      his hands in his pockets, stood regarding him. He, too, did not look
      particularly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;or perhaps you don&rsquo;t know, that when your
      father asked us to look out for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert interrupted. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did father ask you to take care of me?&rdquo; he
      cried, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. He asked somebody who was with him to ask us to do just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy drew a long breath. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he said, hopelessly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Now you run around town and see the sights. Dinner&rsquo;s at half past
      twelve prompt, so be on hand for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After his grandson had gone, the captain, hands still in his pockets,
      stood for some time looking out of the window. At length he spoke aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A play actor or a poetry writer!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut! No use
      talkin&rsquo;, blood will tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar, who was putting coal on the office fire, turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Captain Lote.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have been surprised if he could have seen his grandson just at
      that moment. Albert, on the beach whither he had strayed in his desire to
      be alone, safely hidden from observation behind a sand dune, was lying
      with his head upon his arms and sobbing bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A disinterested person might have decided that the interview which had
      just taken place and which Captain Zelotes hopefully told his wife that
      morning would probably result in &ldquo;a clear, comf&rsquo;table understandin&rsquo; 
      between the boy and me&rdquo;&mdash;such a disinterested person might have
      decided that it had resulted in exactly the opposite. In calculating the
      results to be obtained from that interview the captain had not taken into
      consideration two elements, one his own and the other his grandson&rsquo;s.
      These elements were prejudice and temperament.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, with much the same feeling that a convict must
      experience when he enters upon a life imprisonment, Albert entered the
      employ of &ldquo;Z. Snow and Co., Lumber and Builders&rsquo; Hardware.&rdquo; The day, he
      would have sworn it, was at least a year long. The interval between
      breakfast and dinner was quite six months, yet the dinner hour itself was
      the shortest sixty minutes he had ever known. Mr. Keeler had not yet
      returned to his labors, so there was no instruction in bookkeeping; but
      his grandfather gave him letters to file and long dreary columns of
      invoice figures to add. Twice Captain Zelotes went out and then, just as
      Albert settled back for a rest and breathing spell, Issachar Price
      appeared, warned apparently by some sort of devilish intuition, and
      invented &ldquo;checking up stock&rdquo; and similar menial and tiresome tasks to keep
      him uncomfortable till the captain returned. The customers who came in
      asked questions concerning him and he was introduced to at least a dozen
      citizens of South Harniss, who observed &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; when
      told his identity and, in some instances, addressed him as &ldquo;Bub,&rdquo; which
      was of itself a crime deserving capital punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, as he lay in bed in the back bedroom, he fell asleep facing
      the dreary prospect of another monotonous imprisonment the following day,
      and the next day, and the day after that, and after that&mdash;and after
      that&mdash;and so on&mdash;and on&mdash;and on&mdash;forever and ever, as
      long as life should last. This, then, was to be the end of all his dreams,
      this drudgery in a country town among these commonplace country people.
      This was the end of his dreams of some day writing deathless odes and
      sonnets or thrilling romances; of treading the boards as the hero of
      romantic drama while star-eyed daughters of multi-millionaires gazed from
      the boxes in spellbound rapture. This . . . The thought of the star-eyed
      ones reminded him of the girl who had come into the office the afternoon
      of his first visit to that torture chamber. He had thought of her many
      times since their meeting and always with humiliation and resentment. It
      was his own foolish tongue which had brought the humiliation upon him.
      When she had suggested that he might be employed by Z. Snow and Co. he had
      replied: &ldquo;Me? Work HERE! Well, I should say NOT!&rdquo; And all the time she,
      knowing who he was, must have known he was doomed to work there. He
      resented that superior knowledge of hers. He had made a fool of himself
      but she was to blame for it. Well, by George, he would NOT work there! He
      would run away, he would show her, and his grandfather and all the rest
      what was what. Night after night he fell asleep vowing to run away, to do
      all sorts of desperate deeds, and morning after morning he went back to
      that office.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth morning the prodigal came home, the stray lamb returned to
      the fold&mdash;Mr. Keeler returned to his desk and his duties. There was a
      premonition of his return at the Snow breakfast table. For three days Mrs.
      Ellis had swathed her head in white and her soul in black. For three days
      her favorite accompaniment to conversation had been a groan or a sigh.
      Now, on this fourth morning, she appeared without the bandage on her brow
      or the crape upon her spirit. She was not hilarious but she did not groan
      once, and twice during the meal she actually smiled. Captain Lote
      commented upon the change, she being absent from table momentarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he observed, in an undertone, addressing his wife. &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t a
      comfort to see the wrinkles on Rachel&rsquo;s face curvin&rsquo; up instead of down.
      I&rsquo;m scared to death that she&rsquo;ll go out some time in a cold spell when
      she&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; one of them sympathetics of hers, and her face&rsquo;ll freeze that
      way. Well, Albert,&rdquo; turning to his grandson, &ldquo;the colors&rsquo;ll be h&rsquo;isted to
      the truck now instead of half-mast and life&rsquo;ll be somethin&rsquo; besides one
      everlastin&rsquo; &lsquo;last look at the remains.&rsquo; Now we can take off the mournin&rsquo; 
      till the next funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Olive, &ldquo;and Laban&rsquo;ll be back, too. I&rsquo;m sure you must have
      missed him awfully, Zelotes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed him! I should say so. For one thing, I miss havin&rsquo; him between me
      and Issy. When Labe&rsquo;s there Is talks to him and Labe keeps on thinkin&rsquo; of
      somethin&rsquo; else and so it don&rsquo;t worry him any. I can&rsquo;t do that, and my
      eardrums get to wearin&rsquo; thin and that makes me nervous. Maybe you&rsquo;ve
      noticed that Issy&rsquo;s flow of conversation ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call a trickle,&rdquo;
       he added, turning to Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert had noticed it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what makes Rachel&mdash;Mrs.
      Ellis&mdash;so cheerful this morning? Does she know that Mr. Keeler will
      be back at work? How does she know? She hasn&rsquo;t seen him, has she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t seen him. Nobody sees him, far&rsquo;s
      that goes. He generally clears out somewheres and locks himself up in a
      room, I judge, till his vacation&rsquo;s over. I suppose that&rsquo;s one way to have
      fun, but it ain&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d call hilarious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Zelotes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow. &ldquo;I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t call it fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, but Laban seems to. If he don&rsquo;t do it for fun I don&rsquo;t know what
      he does it for. Maybe it&rsquo;s from a sense of duty. It ain&rsquo;t to oblige me, I
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert repeated his question. &ldquo;But how does she know he will be back
      to-day?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandmother shook her head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the mysterious part about it,&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;It makes a person think there may be somethin&rsquo; in the
      sympathetic notion she talks so much about. She don&rsquo;t see him at all and
      yet we can always tell when he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; back to work by her spirits. If he
      ain&rsquo;t back to-day he will be to-morrow, you&rsquo;ll see. She never misses by
      more than a day. <i>I</i> think it&rsquo;s real sort of mysterious, but Zelotes
      laughs at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote&rsquo;s lip twitched. &ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about as
      mysterious as the clock&rsquo;s strikin&rsquo; twelve when it&rsquo;s noon. <i>I</i> know
      it&rsquo;s morally sartin that Labe&rsquo;ll be back aboard to-day or to-morrow
      because his sprees don&rsquo;t ever last more than five days. I can&rsquo;t swear to
      how she knows, but that&rsquo;s how <i>I</i> know&mdash;and I&rsquo;m darned sure
      there&rsquo;s no &lsquo;sympathy&rsquo; about my part.&rdquo; Then, as if realizing that he had
      talked more than usual, he called, brusquely: &ldquo;Come on, Al, come on. Time
      we were on the job, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, as they passed the window of the office, there, seated on the
      stool behind the tall desk, Albert saw the diminutive figure of the man
      who had been his driver on the night of his arrival. He was curious to see
      how the delinquent would apologize for or explain his absence. But Mr.
      Keeler did neither, nor did Captain Snow ask a question. Instead the pair
      greeted each other as if they had parted in that office at the close of
      business on the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; said Laban, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Labe,&rdquo; replied the captain, just as calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on and opened his own desk, leaving his grandson standing by the
      door, not knowing whether to speak or offer to shake hands. The situation
      was a little difficult, particularly as Mr. Keeler gave no sign of
      recognition, but, after a glance at his employer&rsquo;s companion, went on
      making entries in the ledger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes looked up a moment later. His gray eyes inspected the pair
      and the expression on Albert&rsquo;s face caused them to twinkle slightly.
      &ldquo;Labe,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is my grandson, Albert, the one I told you was
      comin&rsquo; to live with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban turned on the stool, regarded Albert over his spectacles, and
      extended a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, yes . . . Yes, yes, yes. . . Pleased
      to meet you. Cap&rsquo;n Lote said you was comin&rsquo;&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Alfred.
      Howdy do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands. Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s hand trembled a little, but that was the
      only symptom of his recent &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; which the youth could notice.
      Certain vivid remembrances of his father&rsquo;s bad humor on mornings following
      convivial evenings recurred to him. Was it possible that this odd,
      precise, dried-up little man had been on a spree for four days? It did not
      seem possible. He looked more as if he might be expected to rap on the
      desk and ask the school to come to order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to take hold here with us in the office,&rdquo; went on Captain
      Lote. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember I spoke to you about that when we talked about his
      comin&rsquo;. Al, Labe&mdash;Mr. Keeler here&mdash;will start you in larnin&rsquo; to
      bookkeep. He&rsquo;ll be your first mate from now on. Don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;re a
      fo&rsquo;mast hand yet awhile and the way for a fo&rsquo;mast hand to get ahead is to
      obey orders. And don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added, with a quiet chuckle, &ldquo;do any
      play-actin&rsquo; or poetry-makin&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s your watch on deck. Laban nor I
      ain&rsquo;t very strong for play-actin&rsquo;, are we, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban, to whom the reference was anything but clear, replied rather
      vaguely that he didn&rsquo;t know as he was, very. Albert&rsquo;s temper flared up
      again. His grandfather was sneering at him once more; he was always
      sneering at him. All right, let him sneer&mdash;now. Some day he would be
      shown. He scowled and turned away. And Captain Zelotes, noticing the
      scowl, was reminded of a scowl he had seen upon the face of a Spanish
      opera singer some twenty years before. He did not like to be reminded of
      that man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out soon afterward and then Laban, turning to Albert, asked a few
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to like South Harniss, Ansel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was tempted to reply that he, Keeler, had asked him that very
      question before, but he thought it best not to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; he answered, carelessly. &ldquo;Well enough, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like it fust-rate bimeby. Everybody does when they get used to it.
      Takes some time to get used to a place, don&rsquo;t you know it does, Ansel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Yes, yes, so &lsquo;tis. Yes, yes, yes. I don&rsquo;t know why I called you
      Ansel, &lsquo;less &lsquo;twas on account of my knowin&rsquo; an Ansel Olsen once . . . Hum
      . . . Yes, yes. Well, you&rsquo;ll like South Harniss when you get used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy did not answer. He was of the opinion that he should die long
      before the getting used process was completed. Mr. Keeler continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on yesterday&rsquo;s train, did you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at him. Was the fellow joking? He did not look as if he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I came last Monday night. Don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, yes . . . Yes, yes, yes . . . Last Monday night you come, eh? On
      the night train, eh?&rdquo; He hesitated a moment and then asked. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Lote
      fetch you down from the depot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert stared at him open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You drove me down yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time a slight shade of embarrassment crossed the
      bookkeeper&rsquo;s features. He drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes. I kind of thought I&mdash;yes, yes,&mdash;I&mdash;I
      thought likely I did . . . Yes, yes, course I did, course I did. Well, now
      maybe we&rsquo;d better be startin&rsquo; you in to work&mdash;er&mdash;Augustus. Know
      anything about double-entry, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not, nor had he the slightest desire to learn. But before the
      first hour was over he foresaw that he was destined to learn, if he
      remained in that office, whether he wanted to or not. Laban Keeler might
      be, and evidently was, peculiar in his ways, but as a bookkeeper he was
      thoroughness personified. And as a teacher of his profession he was just
      as thorough. All that forenoon Albert practiced the first principles of
      &ldquo;double entry&rdquo; and, after the blessed hour for dinner, came back to
      practice the remainder of the working day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for many days. Little by little he learned to invoice and
      journalize and &ldquo;post in the ledger&rdquo; and all the rest of the detail of
      bookkeeping. Not that his instructor permitted him to do a great deal of
      actual work upon the books of Z. Snow and Co. Those books were too
      spotless and precious for that. Looking over them Albert was surprised and
      obliged to admit a grudging admiration at the manner in which, for the
      most part, they had been kept. Page after page of the neatest of minute
      figures, not a blot, not a blur, not an erasure. So for months; then, in
      the minor books, like the day-book or journal, would suddenly break out an
      eruption of smudges and scrawls in the rugged handwriting of Captain
      Zelotes. When he first happened upon one of these Albert unthinkingly
      spoke to Mr. Keeler about it. He asked the latter what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban slowly stroked his nose with his thumb and finger, a habit he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I was away for a spell then,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;Yes, yes . .
      . Yes, yes, yes. I was away for a little spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went soberly back to his desk. His new assistant, catching a glimpse of
      his face, felt a pang of real pity for the little man. Of course the
      reason for the hiatus in the books was plain enough. He knew about those
      &ldquo;little spells.&rdquo; Oddly enough Laban seemed to feel sorry for them. He
      remembered how funny the bookkeeper had appeared at their first meeting,
      when one &ldquo;spell&rdquo; was just developing, and the contrast between the
      singing, chirruping clown and the precise, grave little person at the desk
      struck even his youthful mind as peculiar. He had read &ldquo;Doctor Jekyll and
      Mr. Hyde,&rdquo; and now here was an example of something similar. He was
      beginning to like Laban Keeler, although he was perfectly sure that he
      should never like bookkeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not slave at the books all the time, of course. For stretches,
      sometimes lasting whole days, his slavery was of another sort. Then he was
      working in the lumber yard with Issachar, or waiting on customers in the
      hardware shop. The cold of winter set in in earnest now and handling &ldquo;two
      by fours&rdquo; and other timber out where the raw winds swept piercingly
      through one&rsquo;s overcoat and garments and flesh to the very bone was a
      trying experience. His hands were chapped and cracked, even though his
      grandmother had knit him a pair of enormous red mittens. He appreciated
      the warmth of the mittens, but he hated the color. Why in the name of all
      that was inartistic did she choose red; not a deep, rich crimson, but a
      screeching vermilion, like a fireman&rsquo;s shirt?
    </p>
    <p>
      Issachar, when he had the opportunity, was a hard boss. It suited Mr.
      Price to display his superior knowledge and to find fault with his
      helper&rsquo;s lack of skill. Albert&rsquo;s hot temper was at the boiling point many
      times, but he fought it down. Occasionally he retorted in kind, but his
      usual and most effective weapon was a more or less delicate sarcasm.
      Issachar did not understand sarcasm and under rapid fire he was inclined
      to lose his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consarn it!&rdquo; he snapped, irritably, on one occasion. &ldquo;Consarn it, Al, why
      don&rsquo;t you h&rsquo;ist up on t&rsquo;other end of that j&rsquo;ist? What do you cal&rsquo;late
      you&rsquo;re out here along of me for; to look harnsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. &ldquo;No, Is,&rdquo; he answered, gravely. &ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t
      be any use. With you around nobody else has a look-in at the &lsquo;handsome&rsquo; 
      game. Issy, what do you do to your face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do to it? What do you mean by do to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do to it to make it look the way it does? Don&rsquo;t tell me it
      grew that way naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grew! Course it grew! What kind of talk&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Issy, with a face like yours how do you keep the birds away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Keep the birds away! Now look here, just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me. Did I say &lsquo;birds,&rsquo; Issy? I didn&rsquo;t mean birds like&mdash;like
      crows. Of course a face like yours would keep the crows away all right
      enough. I meant girls. How do you keep the girls away? I should think they
      would be making love all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you shut up! Just &lsquo;cause you&rsquo;re Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s grandson I presume
      likely you think you can talk any kind of talk, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any kind, Is. I can&rsquo;t talk like you. Will you teach me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up! Now, by Crimus, you&mdash;you furriner&mdash;you Speranzy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler appeared at the office window. His shrill voice rose pipingly
      in the wintry air as he demanded to know what was the trouble out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price, still foaming, strode toward the window; Albert laughingly
      followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; repeated Laban. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough noise for a sewin&rsquo; 
      circle. Be still, Is, can&rsquo;t you, for a minute. Al, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Issy&rsquo;s been talking about his face,&rdquo; explained Albert, soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t neither. I was h&rsquo;istin&rsquo; up my end of a j&rsquo;ist, same as I&rsquo;m paid to
      do, and, &lsquo;stead of helpin&rsquo; he stands there and heaves out talk about&mdash;about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, about&mdash;about me and&mdash;and girls&mdash;and all sorts of dum
      foolishness. I tell ye, I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; else to do beside listen to
      that kind of cheap talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um. Yes, yes. I see. Well, Al, what have you got to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what it is all about. I was working as
      hard as I could and all at once he began pitching into me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pitchin&rsquo; into you? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Something about my looks he didn&rsquo;t like, I guess.
      Wanted to know if I thought I was as handsome as he was, or something like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? I never neither! All I said was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler raised his hand. &ldquo;Seems to be a case for an umpire,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;Um. Seem&rsquo;s if &lsquo;twas, seems so, seems so. Well, Captain Lote&rsquo;s
      just comin&rsquo; across the road and, if you say the word, I&rsquo;ll call him in to
      referee. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They said nothing relevant to the subject in hand. Issachar made the only
      remark. &ldquo;Crimus-TEE!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Come on, Al, come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair hurried away to resume lumber piling. Laban smiled slightly and
      closed the window. It may be gathered from this incident that when the
      captain was in charge of the deck there was little idle persiflage among
      the &ldquo;fo&rsquo;mast hands.&rdquo; They, like others in South Harniss, did not presume
      to trifle with Captain Lote Snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the business education of Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza progressed. At
      the end of the first six weeks in South Harniss he had learned a little
      about bookkeeping, a little about selling hardware, a little about
      measuring and marking lumber. And it must be admitted that that little had
      been acquired, not because of vigorous application on the part of the
      pupil, but because, being naturally quick and intelligent, he could not
      help learning something. He liked the work just as little as he had in the
      beginning of his apprenticeship. And, although he was forgetting his
      thoughts of running away, of attempting fortune on his own hook, he was
      just as rebellious as ever against a future to be spent in that office and
      at that work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the office and the hateful bookkeeping he was beginning to find
      several real interests. At the old house which had for generations been
      called &ldquo;the Snow place,&rdquo; he was beginning to feel almost at home. He and
      his grandmother were becoming close friends. She was not looking for
      trouble, she never sat for long intervals gazing at him as if she were
      guessing, guessing, guessing concerning him. Captain Zelotes did that, but
      Olive did not. She had taken the boy, her &ldquo;Janie&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; to her heart from
      the moment she saw him and she mothered him and loved him in a way which&mdash;so
      long as it was not done in public&mdash;comforted his lonely soul. They
      had not yet reached the stage where he confided in her to any great
      extent, but that was certain to come later. It was his grandmother&rsquo;s love
      and the affection he was already beginning to feel for her which, during
      these first lonesome, miserable weeks, kept him from, perhaps, turning the
      running away fantasy into a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another inmate of the Snow household with whom Albert was becoming better
      acquainted with was Mrs. Rachel Ellis. Their real acquaintanceship began
      one Sunday forenoon when Captain Zelotes and Olive had gone to church.
      Ordinarily he would have accompanied them, to sit in the straight-backed
      old pew on a cushion which felt lumpy and smelt ancient and musty, and
      pretend to listen while old Mr. Kendall preached a sermon which was
      ancient and musty likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Sunday morning he awoke with a headache and his grandmother had
      pleaded for him, declaring that he ought to &ldquo;lay to bed&rdquo; a while and get
      over it. He got over it with surprising quickness after the church bell
      ceased ringing, and came downstairs to read Ivanhoe in the sitting room.
      He had read it several times before, but he wanted to read something and
      the choice of volumes in the Snow bookcase was limited. He was stretched
      out on the sofa with the book in his hand when the housekeeper entered,
      armed with a dust-cloth. She went to church only &ldquo;every other&rdquo; Sunday.
      This was one of the others without an every, and she was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you readin&rsquo;, Albert?&rdquo; she asked, after a few&rsquo; minutes vigorous
      wielding of the dust-cloth. &ldquo;It must be awful interestin&rsquo;, you stick at it
      so close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Black Knight was just then hammering with his battle-axe at the gate
      of Front de Buef&rsquo;s castle, not minding the stones and beams cast down upon
      him from above &ldquo;no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers.&rdquo;
       Albert absently admitted that the story was interesting. The housekeeper
      repeated her request to be told its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; replied the boy; adding, as the name did not seem to convey any
      definite idea to his interrogator&rsquo;s mind: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s by Walter Scott, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis made no remark immediately. When she did it was to the effect
      that she used to know a colored man named Scott who worked at the hotel
      once. &ldquo;He swept out and carried trunks and such things,&rdquo; she explained.
      &ldquo;He seemed to be a real nice sort of colored man, far as ever I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was more interested in the Black Knight of Ivanhoe than the black
      man of the hotel, so he went on reading. Rachel sat down in a chair by the
      window and looked out, twisting and untwisting the dust-cloth in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume likely lots and lots of folks have read that book, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
       she asked, after another interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Oh, yes, almost everybody. It&rsquo;s a classic, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you said the book was. A class-somethin&rsquo; or other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a classic. Why, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s something everybody knows about, or&mdash;or
      ought to know about. One of the big things, you know. Like&mdash;like
      Shakespeare or&mdash;or Robinson Crusoe or Paradise Lost or&mdash;lots of
      them. It&rsquo;s a book everybody reads and always will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Humph! Well, I never read it. . . . I presume likely you think
      that&rsquo;s pretty funny, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert tore himself away from the fight at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do. You think it&rsquo;s awful funny. Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t if you knew
      more about how busy I&rsquo;ve been all my life. I ain&rsquo;t had time to read the
      way I&rsquo;d ought to. I read a book once though that I&rsquo;ll never forget. Did
      you ever read a book called Foul Play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. . . . Why, hold on, though; I think I have. By Charles Reade, wasn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s who wrote it, a man named Charles Reade. Laban told me that
      part of it; he reads a lot, Laban does. I never noticed who wrote it,
      myself. I was too interested in it to notice little extry things like
      that. But ain&rsquo;t that a WONDERFUL book? Ain&rsquo;t that the best book you ever
      read in all your LIFE?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the dust-cloth and was too excited and enthusiastic to pick it
      up. Albert did his best to recall something definite concerning Foul Play.
      The book had been in the school library and he, who read almost
      everything, had read it along with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said musingly. &ldquo;About a shipwreck&mdash;something about a
      shipwreck in it, wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say there was! My stars above! Not the common kind of shipwreck,
      neither, the kind they have down to Setuckit P&rsquo;int on the shoals. No
      sir-ee! This one was sunk on purpose. That Joe Wylie bored holes right
      down through her with a gimlet, the wicked thing! And that set &lsquo;em afloat
      right out on the sea in a boat, and there wan&rsquo;t anything to eat till
      Robert Penfold&mdash;oh, HE was the smart one; he&rsquo;d find anything, that
      man!&mdash;he found the barnacles on the bottom of the boat, just the same
      as he found out how to diffuse intelligence tied onto a duck&rsquo;s leg over
      land knows how many legs&mdash;leagues, I mean&mdash;of ocean. But that
      come later. Don&rsquo;t you remember THAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. The story was beginning to come back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I remember now. He&mdash;the Penfold fellow&mdash;and
      the girl landed on this island and had all sorts of adventures, and fell
      in love and all that sort of stuff, and then her dad came and took her
      back to England and she&mdash;she did something or other there to&mdash;to
      get the Penfold guy out of trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did somethin&rsquo;! I should say she did! Why, she found out all about who
      forged the letter&mdash;the note, I mean&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she done. &lsquo;Twas
      Arthur Wardlaw, that&rsquo;s who &lsquo;twas. And he was tryin&rsquo; to get Helen all the
      time for himself, the skinner! Don&rsquo;t talk to me about that Arthur Wardlaw!
      I never could bear HIM.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as if she had known the detested Wardlaw intimately from
      childhood. Young Speranza was hugely amused. Ivanhoe was quite forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foul Play was great stuff,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;When did you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? When? Oh, ever and ever so long ago. When I was about twenty, I
      guess, and laid up with the measles. That&rsquo;s the only time I ever was real
      what you might call down sick in my life, and I commenced with measles.
      That&rsquo;s the way a good many folks commence, I know, but they don&rsquo;t
      generally wait till they&rsquo;re out of their &lsquo;teens afore they start. I was
      workin&rsquo; for Mrs. Philander Bassett at the time, and she says to me:
      &lsquo;Rachel,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re on the mendin&rsquo; hand now, wouldn&rsquo;t you like a
      book to read?&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;Why, maybe I would.&rsquo; And she fetched up three of
      &lsquo;em. I can see &lsquo;em now, all three, plain as day. One was Barriers Burned
      Away. She said that was somethin&rsquo; about a big fire. Well, I&rsquo;m awful
      nervous about fires, have been from a child, so I didn&rsquo;t read that. And
      another had the queerest kind of a name, if you&rsquo;d call it a name at all;
      &lsquo;twas She.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? Well, I begun to, but my stars, THAT wasn&rsquo;t any book to give to
      a person with nerve symptoms. I got as far as where those Indians or
      whatever they was started to put red-hot kettles on folks&rsquo;s heads, and
      that was enough for ME. &lsquo;Give me somethin&rsquo; civilized,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;or not at
      all.&rsquo; So I commenced Foul Play, and I tell you I kept right on to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that there ever was a much better book
      than that wrote, was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert temporized. &ldquo;It is a good one,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to me there could be much better. Laban says it&rsquo;s good, though
      he won&rsquo;t go so far as to say it&rsquo;s the very best. He&rsquo;s read lots and lots
      of books, Laban has. Reads an awful lot in his spare time. He&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d
      call an educated person, which is what I ain&rsquo;t. And I guess you&rsquo;ll say
      that last is plain enough without bein&rsquo; told,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion, not exactly knowing how to answer, was silent for a moment.
      Rachel, who had picked up and was again twisting the dust-cloth, returned
      to the subject she so delighted in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that Foul Play book,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read till I&rsquo;ve pretty nigh
      wore the covers off. When Mrs. Bassett saw how much I liked it she gave it
      to me for a present. I read a little bit in it every little while. I kind
      of fit the folks in that book to folks in real life, sort of compare &lsquo;em,
      you know. Do you ever do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, repressing a chuckle, said, &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; again. She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s General Rolleson in that book,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know who he
      makes me think of? Cap&rsquo;n Lote, your grandpa, that&rsquo;s who.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      General Rolleson, as Albert remembered him, was an extremely dignified,
      cultured and precise old gentleman. Just what resemblance there might be
      between him and Captain Zelotes Snow, ex-skipper of the Olive S., he could
      not imagine. He could not repress a grin, and the housekeeper noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems funny to you, I presume likely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, now you think
      about it. This General Rolleson man was kind of proud and sot in his ways
      just as your grandpa is, Albert. He had a daughter he thought all the
      world of; so did Cap&rsquo;n Lote. Along come a person that wanted to marry the
      daughter. In the book &lsquo;twas Robert Penfold, who had been a convict. In
      your grandpa&rsquo;s case, &lsquo;twas your pa, who had been a play-actor. So you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert sat up on the sofa. &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; he interrupted indignantly. &ldquo;Do you
      mean to compare my father with a&mdash;with a CONVICT? I want you to
      understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis held up the dust-cloth. &ldquo;Now, now, now,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      go puttin&rsquo; words in my mouth that I didn&rsquo;t say. I don&rsquo;t doubt your pa was
      a nice man, in his way, though I never met him. But &lsquo;twan&rsquo;t Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s
      way any more than Robert Penfold&rsquo;s was General Rolleson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was famous,&rdquo; declared the youth hotly. &ldquo;He was one of the most
      famous singers in this country. Everybody knows that&mdash;that is,
      everybody but Grandfather and the gang down here,&rdquo; he added, in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re wrong. Laban tells me that some of those singin&rsquo; folks
      get awful high wages, more than the cap&rsquo;n of a steamboat, he says, though
      that seems like stretchin&rsquo; it to me. But, as I say, Cap&rsquo;n Lote was proud,
      and nobody but the best would satisfy him for Janie, your mother. Well, in
      that way, you see, he reminds me of General Rolleson in the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mrs. Ellis. Tell me about this business of Dad&rsquo;s marrying my
      mother. I never knew much of anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t? Did your pa never tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! That&rsquo;s funny. Still, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s as &lsquo;twas, after all,
      considerin&rsquo; you was only a boy. Probably he&rsquo;d have told you some day.
      Well, I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any secret about it. &lsquo;Twas town talk down
      here when it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told him the story of the runaway marriage. Albert listened with
      interest and the almost incredulous amazement with which the young always
      receive tales of their parents&rsquo; love affairs. Love, for people of his age
      or a trifle older, was a natural and understandable thing, but for his
      father, as he remembered him, to have behaved in this way was
      incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Rachel, in conclusion, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how it happened. That&rsquo;s why
      Cap&rsquo;n Lote couldn&rsquo;t ever forgive your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed his head. &ldquo;Well, he ought to have forgiven him,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;He was dead lucky to get such a man for a son-in-law, if you ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t think so. And he wouldn&rsquo;t ever mention your pa&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt that. Anybody can see how he hated Father. And he hates
      me the same way,&rdquo; he added moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis was much disturbed. &ldquo;Oh, no, he don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t
      think that, Albert. He don&rsquo;t hate you, I&rsquo;m sure of it. He&rsquo;s just kind of
      doubtful about you, that&rsquo;s all. He remembers how your pa acted&mdash;or
      how he thinks he acted&mdash;and so he can&rsquo;t help bein&rsquo; the least mite
      afraid the same thing may crop out in you. If you just stick to your job
      over there at the lumber yards and keep on tryin&rsquo; to please him, he&rsquo;ll get
      all over that suspicion, see if he don&rsquo;t. Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow is stubborn
      sometimes and hard to turn, but he&rsquo;s square as a brick. There&rsquo;s some that
      don&rsquo;t like him, and a good many that don&rsquo;t agree with him&mdash;but
      everybody respects him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not answer. The housekeeper rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve set down for so long.
      Goodness knows I&rsquo;ve got work enough to do without settin&rsquo; around talkin&rsquo;.
      I can&rsquo;t think what possessed me to do it this time, unless &lsquo;twas seein&rsquo; 
      you readin&rsquo; that book.&rdquo; She paused a moment and then said: &ldquo;Albert, I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t want you and your grandpa to have any quarrels. You see&mdash;well,
      you see, I used to know your mother real well, and&mdash;and I thought an
      awful sight of her. I wish&mdash;I do wish when you and the cap&rsquo;n have any
      trouble or anything, or when you think you&rsquo;re liable to have any, you&rsquo;d
      come and talk it over with me. I&rsquo;m like the feller that Laban tells about
      in his dog-fight yarn. This feller was watchin&rsquo; the fight and when they
      asked him to stop it afore one or t&rsquo;other of the dogs was killed, he just
      shook his head. &lsquo;No-o,&rsquo; he says, kind of slow and moderate, &lsquo;I guess I
      shan&rsquo;t interfere. One of &lsquo;em&rsquo;s been stealin&rsquo; my chickens and the other one
      bit me. I&rsquo;m a friend to both parties,&rsquo; he says. Course I don&rsquo;t mean it
      exactly that way,&rdquo; she added, with a smile, &ldquo;but you know what I do mean,
      I guess. WILL you talk things over with me sometimes, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His answer was not very enthusiastic, but he said he guessed so, and
      Rachel seemed satisfied with that. She went on with her dusting, and he
      with his reading, but the conversation was the first of many between the
      pair. The housekeeper appeared to consider his having read her beloved
      Foul Play a sort of password admitting him to her lodge and that
      thereafter they were, in consequence, to be confidants and comrades. She
      never hesitated to ask him the most personal questions concerning his
      work, his plans, the friends or acquaintances he was making in the
      village. Some of those questions he answered honestly and fully, some he
      dodged, some he did not answer at all. Mrs. Ellis never resented his not
      answering. &ldquo;I presume likely that ain&rsquo;t any of my business, is it?&rdquo; she
      would say, and ask about something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, she was perfectly outspoken concerning her own affairs.
      He was nearly overcome with hilarious joy when, one day, she admitted
      that, in her mind, Robert Penfold, the hero of Foul Play, lived again in
      the person of Laban Keeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Ellis,&rdquo; he cried, as soon as he could trust himself to speak at
      all, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see THAT. Penfold was a six-footer, wasn&rsquo;t he? And&mdash;and
      athletic, you know, and&mdash;and a minister, and young&mdash;younger, I
      mean&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel interrupted. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And Laban is little,
      and not very young, and, whatever else he is, he ain&rsquo;t a minister. I know
      all that. I know the outside of him don&rsquo;t look like Robert Penfold at all.
      But,&rdquo; somewhat apologetically, &ldquo;you see I&rsquo;ve been acquainted with him so
      many years I&rsquo;ve got into the habit of seein&rsquo; his INSIDE. Now that sounds
      kind of ridiculous, I know,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Sounds as if I&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      as if I was in the habit of takin&rsquo; him apart, like a watch or somethin&rsquo;.
      What I mean is that I know him all through. I&rsquo;ve known him for a long,
      long while. He ain&rsquo;t much to look at, bein&rsquo; so little and sort of dried
      up, but he&rsquo;s got a big, fine heart and big brains. He can do &lsquo;most
      anything he sets his hand to. When I used to know him, when I was a girl,
      folks was always prophesyin&rsquo; that Laban Keeler would turn out to be a
      whole lot more&rsquo;n the average. He would, too, only for one thing, and you
      know what that is. It&rsquo;s what has kept me from marryin&rsquo; him all this time.
      I swore I&rsquo;d never marry a man that drinks, and I never will. Why, if it
      wasn&rsquo;t for liquor Labe would have been runnin&rsquo; his own business and
      gettin&rsquo; rich long ago. He all but runs Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s place as &lsquo;tis. The
      cap&rsquo;n and a good many other folks don&rsquo;t realize that, but it&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain that she worshiped the little bookkeeper and, except during
      the periods of &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; and &ldquo;sympathetics,&rdquo; was tremendously proud of
      him. Albert soon discovered that Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s feeling for her was equally
      strong. In his case, though, there was also a strong strain of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine woman, Al,&rdquo; he confided to his assistant on one occasion. &ldquo;A
      fine woman. . . . Yes, yes, yes. They don&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em any finer. Ah hum!
      And not so long ago I read about a passel of darn fools arguin&rsquo; that the
      angels in heaven was all he-ones. . . . Umph! . . . Sho, sho! If men was
      as good as women, Ansel&mdash;Alfred&mdash;Albert, I mean&mdash;we could
      start an opposition heaven down here most any time. &lsquo;Most any time&mdash;yes,
      yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was considerable for him to say. Except when on a vacation, Laban was
      not loquacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each Sunday afternoon, when the weather was pleasant, he came, dressed in
      his best black cutaway, shiny at elbows and the under part of the sleeves,
      striped trousers and a pearl gray soft hat with a black band, a hat which
      looked as much out of place above his round, withered little face as a red
      roof might have looked on a family vault, and he and the housekeeper went
      for a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel, in her Sunday black, bulked large beside him. As Captain Zelotes
      said, the pair looked like &ldquo;a tug takin&rsquo; a liner out to sea.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Outside of the gates of the Snow place Albert was making many
      acquaintances and a few friends. After church on Sundays his grandmother
      had a distressful habit of suddenly seizing his arm or his coat-tail as he
      was hurrying toward the vestibule and the sunshine of outdoors, and
      saying: &ldquo;Oh, Albert, just a minute! Here&rsquo;s somebody you haven&rsquo;t met yet, I
      guess. Elsie&rdquo;&mdash;or Nellie or Mabel or Henry or Charlie or George,
      whichever it happened to be&mdash;&ldquo;this is my grandson, Albert Speranza.&rdquo;
       And the young person to whom he was thus introduced would, if a male,
      extend a hesitating hand, give his own an embarrassed shake, smile
      uncertainly and say, &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;yes. Pleased to meet you.&rdquo; Or, if
      of the other sex, would blush a little and venture the observation that it
      was a lovely morning, and wasn&rsquo;t the sermon splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Sabbath introductions led to week-day, or rather week-evening,
      meetings. The principal excitement in South Harniss was &ldquo;going for the
      mail.&rdquo; At noon and after supper fully one-half of the village population
      journeyed to the post office. Albert&rsquo;s labors for Z. Snow and Co.
      prevented his attending the noon gatherings&mdash;his grandfather usually
      got the morning mail&mdash;but he early formed the habit of sauntering
      &ldquo;down street&rdquo; in the evening if the weather was not too cold or
      disagreeable. There he was certain to find groups of South Harniss youth
      of both sexes, talking, giggling, skylarking and flirting. Sometimes he
      joined one or the other of these groups; quite as often he did not, but
      kept aloof and by himself, for it may as well be acknowledged now, if it
      is not already plain, that the son of Miguel Carlos Speranza had inherited
      a share of his father&rsquo;s temperament and self-esteem. The whim of the
      moment might lead him to favor these young people with his society, but he
      was far from considering himself under obligation to do so. He had not the
      least idea that he was in any way a snob, he would have hotly resented
      being called one, but he accepted his estimate of his own worth as
      something absolute and certain, to be taken for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this attitude of mind had its dangers. Coupled with its possessor&rsquo;s
      extraordinary good looks, it was fascinating to a large percentage of the
      village girls. The Speranza eyes and the Speranza curls and nose and chin
      were, when joined with the easy condescension of the Speranza manner, a
      combination fatal to the susceptible. The South Harniss &ldquo;flappers,&rdquo; most
      of them, enthused over the new bookkeeper in the lumber office. They ogled
      and giggled and gushed in his presence, and he was tolerant or bored, just
      as he happened to be feeling at the moment. But he never displayed a
      marked interest in any one of them, for the very good reason that he had
      no such interest. To him they were merely girls, nice enough in their way,
      perhaps, but that way not his. Most of the town young fellows of his age
      he found had a &ldquo;girl&rdquo; and almost every girl had a &ldquo;fellow&rdquo;; there was calf
      love in abundance, but he was a different brand of veal.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a great man must amuse himself, and so he accepted invitations to
      church socials and suppers and to an occasional dance or party. His style
      of dancing was not that of South Harniss in the winter. It was common
      enough at the hotel or the &ldquo;tea house&rdquo; in July and August when the summer
      people were there, but not at the town hall at the Red Men&rsquo;s Annual Ball
      in February. A fellow who could foxtrot as he could swept all before him.
      Sam Thatcher, of last year&rsquo;s class in the high school, but now clerking in
      the drug store, who had hitherto reigned as the best &ldquo;two-stepper&rdquo; in
      town, suddenly became conscious of his feet. Then, too, the contents of
      the three trunks which had been sent on from school were now in evidence.
      No Boston or Brockton &ldquo;Advanced Styles&rdquo; held a candle to those suits which
      the tailor of the late Miguel Carlos had turned out for his patron&rsquo;s only
      son. No other eighteen-year-older among the town&rsquo;s year-around residents
      possessed a suit of evening clothes. Albert wore his &ldquo;Tux&rdquo; at the Red
      Men&rsquo;s Ball and hearts palpitated beneath new muslin gowns and bitter envy
      stirred beneath the Brockton &ldquo;Advanced Styles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In consequence, by spring the social status of Albert Speranza among those
      of his own age in the village had become something like this: He was in
      high favor with most of the girls and in corresponding disfavor with most
      of the young fellows. The girls, although they agreed that he was
      &ldquo;stand-offish and kind of queer,&rdquo; voted him &ldquo;just lovely, all the same.&rdquo;
       Their envious beaux referred to him sneeringly among themselves as a
      &ldquo;stuck-up dude.&rdquo; Some one of them remembered having been told that Captain
      Zelotes, years before, had been accustomed to speak of his hated
      son-in-law as &ldquo;the Portygee.&rdquo; Behind his back they formed the habit of
      referring to their new rival in the same way. The first time Albert heard
      himself called a &ldquo;Portygee&rdquo; was after prayer meeting on Friday evening,
      when, obeying a whim, he had walked home with Gertie Kendrick, quite
      forgetful of the fact that Sam Thatcher, who aspired to be Gertie&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;steady,&rdquo; was himself waiting on the church steps for that privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then nothing might have come of it had he and Sam not met in the path
      as he was sauntering back across lots to the main road and home. It was a
      brilliant moonlight night and the pair came together, literally, at the
      bend where the path turns sharply around the corner of Elijah Doane&rsquo;s
      cranberry shanty. Sam, plowing along, head down and hands in his pockets,
      swung around that corner and bumped violently into Albert, who, a
      cigarette between his lips&mdash;out here in the fields, away from
      civilization and Captain Zelotes, was a satisfyingly comfortable place to
      smoke a cigarette&mdash;was dreaming dreams of a future far away from
      South Harniss. Sam had been thinking of Gertie. Albert had not. She had
      been a mere incident of the evening; he had walked home with her because
      he happened to be in the mood for companionship and she was rather pretty
      and always talkative. His dreams during the stroll back alone in the
      moonlight had been of lofty things, of poetry and fame and high emprise;
      giggling Gerties had no place in them. It was distinctly different with
      Sam Thatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crashed together, gasped and recoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see where you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;, you darned Portygee half-breed?&rdquo;
       demanded Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert, who had stepped past him, turned and came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said you was a darned half-breed, and you are. You&rsquo;re a no-good
      Portygee, like your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was all he had time to say. For the next few minutes he was too busy to
      talk. The Speranzas, father and son, possessed temperament; also they
      possessed temper. Sam&rsquo;s face, usually placid and good-natured, for Sam was
      by no means a bad fellow in his way, was fiery red. Albert&rsquo;s, on the
      contrary, went perfectly white. He seemed to settle back on his heels and
      from there almost to fly at his insulter. Five minutes or so later they
      were both dusty and dirty and dishevelled and bruised, but Sam was pretty
      thoroughly licked. For one thing, he had been taken by surprise by his
      adversary&rsquo;s quickness; for another, Albert&rsquo;s compulsory training in
      athletics at school gave him an advantage. He was by no means an unscarred
      victor, but victor he was. Sam was defeated, and very much astonished. He
      leaned against the cranberry house and held on to his nose. It had been a
      large nose in the beginning, it was larger now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert stood before him, his face&mdash;where it was not a pleasing
      combination of black and blue&mdash;still white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&mdash;if you speak of my father or me again like that,&rdquo; he panted,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he strode off, a bit wobbly on his legs, but with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly enough, no one except the two most interested ever knew of this
      encounter. Albert, of course, did not tell. He was rather ashamed of it.
      For the son of Miguel Carlos Speranza to conquer dragons was a worthy and
      heroic business, but there seemed to be mighty little heroism in licking
      Sam Thatcher behind &lsquo;Lije Doane&rsquo;s cranberry shack. And Sam did not tell.
      Gertie next day confided that she didn&rsquo;t care two cents for that stuck-up
      Al Speranza, anyway; she had let him see her home only because Sam had
      danced so many times with Elsie Wixon at the ball that night. So Sam said
      nothing concerning the fight, explaining the condition of his nose by
      saying that he had run into something in the dark. And he did not appear
      to hold a grudge against his conqueror; on the contrary when others spoke
      of the latter as a &ldquo;sissy,&rdquo; Sam defended him. &ldquo;He may be a dude,&rdquo; said
      Sam; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say he ain&rsquo;t. But he ain&rsquo;t no sissy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When pressed to tell why he was so certain, his answer was: &ldquo;Because he
      don&rsquo;t act like one.&rdquo; It was not a convincing answer, the general opinion
      being that that was exactly how Al Speranza did act.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one young person in the village toward whom Albert found himself
      making exceptions in his attitude of serenely impersonal tolerance. That
      person was Helen Kendall, the girl who had come into his grandfather&rsquo;s
      office the first morning of his stay in South Harniss. He was forced to
      make these exceptions by the young lady herself. When he met her the
      second time&mdash;which was after church on his first Sunday&mdash;his
      manner was even more loftily reserved than usual. He had distinct
      recollections of their first conversation. His own part in it had not been
      brilliant, and in it he had made the absurd statement&mdash;absurd in the
      light of what came after&mdash;that he was certainly NOT employed by Z.
      Snow and Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was cool and superior when his grandmother brought them together
      after the meeting was over. If Helen noticed the superiority, she was
      certainly not over-awed by it, for she was so simple and natural and
      pleasant that he was obliged to unbend and be natural too. In fact, at
      their third meeting he himself spoke of the interview in the lumber office
      and again expressed his thanks for warning him of his grandfather&rsquo;s
      detestation of cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly glad that you put me on to the old
      boy&rsquo;s feelings. I think he&rsquo;d have murdered me if he had come back and
      found me puffing a Pall Mall in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;He does hate them, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate them! I should say he did. Hating cigarettes is about the only point
      where he and Issy get along without an argument. If a traveler for a
      hardware house comes into the office smoking a cig, Issy opens all the
      windows to let the smell out, and Grandfather opens the door to throw the
      salesman out. Well, not exactly to throw him out, of course, but he never
      buys a single cent&rsquo;s worth of a cigarette smoker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen glanced at him. &ldquo;You must be awfully glad you&rsquo;re not a traveling
      salesman,&rdquo; she said demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not know exactly what to make of that remark. He, in his turn,
      looked at her, but she was grave and quite unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ought I to be glad I&rsquo;m not a traveling salesman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It just seemed to me that you ought, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you were you wouldn&rsquo;t make a great hit with your grandfather,
      would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? . . . Oh, you mean because I smoke. Say, YOU&rsquo;RE not silly enough to
      be down on cigarettes the way grandfather is, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, I&rsquo;m not down on them, especially. I&rsquo;m not very well acquainted with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither is he. He never smoked one in his life. It&rsquo;s just country
      prejudice, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I live in the country, too, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because any one can see you are.&rdquo; The manner in which this remark was
      made, a manner implying a wide knowledge of humanity and a hint of
      personal interest and discriminating appreciation, had been found quite
      effective by the precocious young gentleman uttering it. With variations
      to suit the case and the individual it had been pleasantly received by
      several of the Misses Bradshaw&rsquo;s pupils. He followed it with another
      equally tried and trustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;would YOU rather I didn&rsquo;t smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The obvious reply should have been, &ldquo;Oh, would you stop if I asked you
      to?&rdquo; But Helen Kendall was a most disconcerting girl. Instead of purring a
      pleased recognition of the implied flattery, she laughed merrily. The
      Speranza dignity was hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to laugh at?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Are you laughing at me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was as truthful as truth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I am,&rdquo; she replied; and then completed his discomfiture by
      adding, &ldquo;Why should I care whether you smoke or not? You had better ask
      your grandfather that question, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza had not been accustomed to this sort of
      treatment from young persons of the other sex, and he walked away in a
      huff. But the unusual is always attractive, and the next time he and Miss
      Kendall met he was as gracious and cordial as ever. But it was not long
      before he learned that the graciousness was, in her case, a mistake.
      Whenever he grew lofty, she took him down, laughed at him with complete
      frankness, and refused to treat him as anything but a boy. So they
      gradually grew friendly, and when they met at parties or church socials he
      spent most of the time in her company, or, rather, he would have so spent
      it had she permitted. But she was provokingly impartial and was quite as
      likely to refuse a dance with him to sit out one with Sam Thatcher or Ben
      Hammond or any other village youth of her acquaintance. However, although
      she piqued and irritated him, he was obliged to admit to his inner
      consciousness that she was the most interesting person he had yet
      discovered in South Harniss, also that even in the eyes of such
      connoisseurs as his fellow members of the senior class at school she would
      have been judged a &ldquo;good looker,&rdquo; in spite of her country clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her father, of course. The Reverend Mr. Kendall was a dreamy little
      old gentleman with white hair and the stooped shoulders of a student.
      Everybody liked him, and it was for that reason principally that he was
      still the occupant of the Congregational pulpit, for to quote Captain
      Zelotes, his sermons were inclined to be like the sandy road down to
      Setuckit Point, &ldquo;ten mile long and dry all the way.&rdquo; He was a widower and
      his daughter was his companion and managing housekeeper. There was a
      half-grown girl, one of the numerous Price family, a cousin of Issachar&rsquo;s,
      who helped out with the sweeping, dish-washing and cooking, but Helen was
      the real head of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s a capable one, too,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Snow, when at supper one
      evening Helen&rsquo;s name had come into the conversation. &ldquo;I declare when I was
      there yesterday to see the minister about readin&rsquo; poetry to us at
      sewin&rsquo;-circle next Monday that parlor was as neat as wax. And &lsquo;twas all
      Helen&rsquo;s work that kept it so, that was plain enough. You could see her way
      of settin&rsquo; a vase or puttin&rsquo; on a table cloth wherever you looked. Nobody
      else has just that way. And she does it after school or before school or
      &lsquo;most any odd time. And whatever &lsquo;tis is done right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper put in a word. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about that,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t any more doubt that she don&rsquo;t get much help from her pa
      or that Maria B.&rdquo; There were so many Prices within the township limits
      that individuals were usually distinguished by their middle initial. &ldquo;As
      for Mr. Kendall,&rdquo; went on Rachel, &ldquo;he moves with his head in the clouds
      and his feet cruisin&rsquo; with nobody at the wheel two-thirds of the time.
      Emma Smith says to me yesterday, says she, &lsquo;Mr. Kendall is a saint on
      earth, ain&rsquo;t he,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and he&rsquo;ll be one in heaven any
      minute if he goes stumblin&rsquo; acrost the road in front of Doctor Holliday&rsquo;s
      automobile the way I see him yesterday.&rsquo; The doctor put on the brakes with
      a slam and a yell. The minister stopped right there in the middle of the
      road with the front wheels of that auto not MORE&rsquo;N two foot from his old
      baggy trousers&rsquo; knees, and says he, &lsquo;Eh? Did you want me, Doctor?&rsquo; The
      doctor fetched a long breath. &lsquo;Why, no, Mr. Kendall,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t,
      but I come darn nigh gettin&rsquo; you.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know what WOULD become of him
      if he didn&rsquo;t have Helen to look out for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they came to know each other better their conversation dealt with
      matters more personal. They sometimes spoke of plans for the future.
      Albert&rsquo;s plans and ambitions were lofty, but rather vague. Helen&rsquo;s were
      practical and definite. She was to graduate from high school that spring.
      Then she was hoping to teach in the primary school there in the village;
      the selectmen had promised her the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to stay here always. When I can,
      after I have saved some money and if Father doesn&rsquo;t need me too badly, I
      shall go away somewhere, to Bridgewater, or perhaps to Radcliffe, and
      study. I want to specialize in my teaching, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert regarded her with amused superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why on earth you are so anxious to be a school-marm,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the last job I&rsquo;d want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was given promptly, but without the least trace of temper. That
      was one of the most provoking things about this girl, she would not lose
      her temper. He usually lost his trying to make her. She spoke now,
      pleasantly, and deliberately, but as if she were stating an undesirable
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be the last one you would get,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Great Scott! I guess I could teach school if I wanted to. But you
      bet I wouldn&rsquo;t want to! . . . NOW what are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are. I can always tell when you&rsquo;re laughing; you get that look
      in your eyes, that sort of&mdash;of&mdash;Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you what kind
      of look it is, but it makes me mad. It&rsquo;s the same kind of look my
      grandfather has, and I could punch him for it sometimes. Why should you
      and he think I&rsquo;m not going to amount to anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. And I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t either. And I wasn&rsquo;t laughing
      at you. Or, if I was, it&mdash;it was only because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because you are so AWFULLY sure you know&mdash;well, know more than
      most people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning I&rsquo;m stuck on myself, I suppose. Well, now I tell you I&rsquo;m not
      going to hang around in this one-horse town all my life to please
      grandfather or any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he mentioned his determination to win literary glory she was always
      greatly interested. Dreams of histrionic achievement were more coldly
      received. The daughter of a New England country clergyman, even in these
      days of broadening horizons, could scarcely be expected to look with favor
      upon an actor&rsquo;s career.
    </p>
    <p>
      June came and with it the first of the summer visitors. For the next three
      months Albert was happy with a new set of acquaintances. They were HIS
      kind, these young folks from the city, and his spare moments were for the
      most part spent in their society. He was popular with them, too. Some of
      them thought it queer that he should be living all the year in the village
      and keeping books for a concern like Z. Snow and Co., but juvenile society
      is tolerant and a youth who could sing passably, dance wonderfully and,
      above all, was as beautifully picturesque as Albert Speranza, was
      welcomed, especially by the girls. So the Saturdays and Sundays and
      evenings of that summer were pleasant for him. He saw little of Helen or
      Gertie Kendrick while the hotel or the cottages remained open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the fall and another long, dreary winter. Albert plodded on at
      his desk or in the yard, following Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s suggestions, obeying his
      grandfather&rsquo;s orders, tormenting Issy, doing his daily stint because he
      had to, not because he liked it. For amusement he read a good deal, went
      to the usual number of sociables and entertainments, and once took part in
      amateur theatricals, a play given by the church society in the town hall.
      There was where he shone. As the dashing young hero he was resplendent.
      Gertie Kendrick gazed upon him from the third settee center with shining
      eyes. When he returned home after it was over his grandmother and Mrs.
      Ellis overwhelmed him with praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare you was perfectly splendid, Albert!&rdquo; exclaimed Olive. &ldquo;I was so
      proud of you I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel looked upon him as one might look upon a god from Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I could think of was Robert Penfold,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I says so to Laban:
      &lsquo;Laban,&rsquo; says I, ain&rsquo;t he Robert Penfold and nobody else?&rsquo; There you was,
      tellin&rsquo; that Hannibal Ellis that you was innocent and some day the world
      would know you was, just the way Robert Penfold done in the book. I never
      did like that Hannie Ellis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow smiled. &ldquo;Mercy, Rachel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not blamin&rsquo; 
      Hannie because of what he did in that play. That was his part, he had to
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rachel was not convinced. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have to be so everlastin&rsquo; mean
      and spiteful about it, anyhow,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;But there, that family of
      Ellises never did amount to nothin&rsquo; much. But, as I said to Laban, Albert,
      you was Robert Penfold all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Labe say to that?&rdquo; asked Albert, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never had a chance to say nothin&rsquo;. Afore he could answer, that Maria
      B. Price&mdash;she was settin&rsquo; right back of me and eatin&rsquo; molasses candy
      out of a rattly paper bag till I thought I SHOULD die&mdash;she leaned
      forward and she whispered: &lsquo;He looks more to me like that Stevie D. that
      used to work for Cap&rsquo;n Crowell over to the Center. Stevie D. had curly
      hair like that and HE was part Portygee, you remember; though there was a
      little nigger blood in him, too,&rsquo; she says. I could have shook her! And
      then she went to rattlin&rsquo; that bag again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Keeler congratulated him at the office next morning. &ldquo;You done
      well, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. You done fust-rate,
      fust-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather was the only one who refused to enthuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired Captain Zelotes, sitting down at his desk and glancing at
      his grandson over his spectacles, &ldquo;do you cal&rsquo;late to be able to get down
      to earth this mornin&rsquo; far enough to figger up the payroll? You can put
      what you made from play-actin&rsquo; on a separate sheet. It&rsquo;s about as much as
      the average person makes at that job,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s face flushed. There were times when he hated his grandfather. Mr.
      Keeler, a moment later, put a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind the old man, Al,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I expect that seein&rsquo; 
      you last night brought your dad&rsquo;s job back to him strong. He can&rsquo;t bear
      play-actin&rsquo;, you know, on your dad&rsquo;s account. Yes&mdash;yes. That was it.
      Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may have been a truthful explanation, but as an apology it was a
      limited success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father was a gentleman, at any rate,&rdquo; snapped Albert. Laban opened his
      mouth to reply, but closed it again and walked back to his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, which was an unusually balmy month, the Congregational Sunday
      School gave an automobile excursion and box-luncheon party at High Point
      Light down at Trumet. As Rachel Ellis said, it was pretty early for
      picnickin&rsquo;, but if the Almighty&rsquo;s season was ahead of time there didn&rsquo;t
      seem to be any real good reason why one of his Sunday schools shouldn&rsquo;t
      be. And, which was the principal excuse for the hurry, the hotel busses
      could be secured, which would not be the case after the season opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert went to the picnic. He was not very keen on going, but his
      grandfather had offered him a holiday for the purpose, and it was one of
      his principles never to refuse a chance to get away from that office.
      Besides, a number of the young people of his age were going, and Gertie
      Kendrick had been particularly insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just MUST come, Al,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be any fun at all if you
      don&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is possible that Gertie found it almost as little fun when he did come.
      He happened to be in one of his moods that day; &ldquo;Portygee streaks,&rdquo; his
      grandfather termed these moods, and told Olive that they were &ldquo;that
      play-actor breakin&rsquo; out in him.&rdquo; He talked but little during the ride down
      in the bus, refused to sing when called upon, and, after dinner, when the
      dancing in the pavilion was going on, stepped quietly out of the side door
      and went tramping along the edge of the bluff, looking out over the sea or
      down to the beach, where, one hundred and fifty feet below, the big waves
      were curling over to crash into a creamy mass of froth and edge the strand
      with lacy ripples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The high clay bluffs of Trumet are unique. No other part of the Cape shows
      anything just like them. High Point Light crowns their highest and
      steepest point and is the flashing beacon the rays of which spell
      &ldquo;America&rdquo; to the incoming liner Boston bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the path skirting the edge of the bluff Albert strolled, his hands
      in his pockets and his thoughts almost anywhere except on the picnic and
      the picnickers of the South Harniss Congregational Church. His particular
      mood on this day was one of discontent and rebellion against the fate
      which had sentenced him to the assistant bookkeeper&rsquo;s position in the
      office of Z. Snow and Co. At no time had he reconciled himself to the idea
      of that position as a permanent one; some day, somehow he was going to
      break away and do&mdash;marvelous things. But occasionally, and usually
      after a disagreeable happening in the office, he awoke from his youthful
      day dreams of glorious futures to a realization of the dismal to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happening which had brought about realization in this instance was
      humorous in the eyes of two-thirds of South Harniss&rsquo;s population. They
      were chuckling over it yet. The majority of the remaining third were
      shocked. Albert, who was primarily responsible for the whole affair, was
      neither amused nor shocked; he was angry and humiliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Seabury Calvin, of Providence, R. I., had arrived in town and
      opened his summer cottage unusually early in the season. What was quite as
      important, Mrs. Seabury Calvin had arrived with him. The Reverend Calvin,
      whose stay was in this case merely temporary, was planning to build an
      addition to his cottage porch. Mrs. Calvin, who was the head of the summer
      &ldquo;Welfare Workers,&rdquo; whatever they were, had called a meeting at the Calvin
      house to make Welfare plans for the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber for the new porch was ordered of Z. Snow and Co. The Reverend
      Calvin ordered it himself in person. Albert received the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish this delivered to-morrow without fail,&rdquo; said Mr. Calvin. Albert
      promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But promises are not always easy to keep. One of Z. Snow and Co.&lsquo;s teams
      was busy hauling lumber for the new schoolhouse at Bayport. The other
      Issachar had commandeered for deliveries at Harniss Center and refused to
      give up his claim. And Laban Keeler, as it happened, was absent on one of
      his &ldquo;vacations.&rdquo; Captain Zelotes was attending a directors&rsquo; meeting at
      Osham and from there was going to Boston for a day&rsquo;s stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s in your hands, Al,&rdquo; he had said to his grandson. &ldquo;Let me see
      how you handle her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, in spite of Albert&rsquo;s promise, the Calvin lumber was not delivered on
      time. The Reverend gentleman called to ask why. His manner was anything
      but receptive so far as excuses were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said loftily, &ldquo;I am accustomed to do business with
      business people. Did you or did you not promise to deliver my order
      yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes sir, I promised, but we couldn&rsquo;t do it. We&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to know why you didn&rsquo;t do it. The fact that you did not is
      sufficient. Will that order of mine be delivered to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a possible thing, Mr. Calvin, it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. Will it be delivered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Speranza temper was rising. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the owner of that temper,
      succinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does yes mean yes, in this case; or does it mean what it meant before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Young man, if that lumber is not delivered to-day I shall
      cancel the order. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert swallowed hard. &ldquo;I tell you, Mr. Calvin, that it shall be
      delivered,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But delivering it was not so easy. The team simply could NOT be taken off
      the schoolhouse job, fulfillment of a contract was involved there. And the
      other horse had gone lame and Issachar swore by all that was solemn that
      the animal must not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let old Calvin wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; said Issy. &ldquo;You can use the big team
      then. And Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;ll be home, besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Albert was not going to let &ldquo;old Calvin&rdquo; wait. That lumber was going
      to be delivered, if he had to carry it himself, stick by stick. He asked
      Mr. Price if an extra team might not be hired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t none,&rdquo; said Issy. &ldquo;Besides, where&rsquo;d your granddad&rsquo;s profits be if
      you spent money hirin&rsquo; extry teams to haul that little mite of stuff? I&rsquo;ve
      been in this business a good long spell, and I tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not get a chance to tell it, for Albert walked off and left him. At
      half-past twelve that afternoon he engaged &ldquo;Vessie&rdquo; Young&mdash;christened
      Sylvester Young and a brother to the driver of the depot wagon&mdash;to
      haul the Calvin lumber in his rickety, fragrant old wagon. Simpson Mullen&mdash;commonly
      called &ldquo;Simp&rdquo;&mdash;was to help in the delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against violent protests from Issy, who declared that Ves Young&rsquo;s
      rattle-trap wan&rsquo;t fit to do nothin&rsquo; but haul fish heads to the fertilizer
      factory, the Calvin beams and boards were piled high on the wagon and with
      Ves on the driver&rsquo;s seat and Simp perched, like a disreputable carrion
      crow on top of the load, the equipage started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert, with satisfaction. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t
      delivered this time according to promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfreys!&rdquo; snorted Issy, gazing after the departing wagon. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be
      able to say nothin&rsquo; when he sees that git-up&mdash;and smells it. Ves
      carts everything in that cart from dead cows to gurry barrels. Whew! I&rsquo;d
      hate to have to set on that porch when &lsquo;twas built of that lumber. And,
      unless I&rsquo;m mistook, Ves and Simp had been havin&rsquo; a little somethin&rsquo; strong
      to take, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price, as it happened, was not &ldquo;mistook.&rdquo; Mr. Young had, as the South
      Harniss saying used to be, &ldquo;had a jug come down&rdquo; on the train from Boston
      that very morning. The jug was under the seat of his wagon and its
      contents had already been sampled by him and by Simp. The journey to the
      Calvin cottage was enlivened by frequent stops for refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently it happened that, just as Mrs. Calvin&rsquo;s gathering of Welfare
      Workers had reached the cake and chocolate stage in their proceedings and
      just as the Reverend Mr. Calvin had risen by invitation to say a few words
      of encouragement, the westerly wind blowing in at the open windows bore to
      the noses and ears of the assembled faithful a perfume and a sound neither
      of which was sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the rattle and squeak of the Young wagon turning in at the Calvin
      gate arose the voices of Vessie and Simp uplifted in song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the good old whiskey, drink &lsquo;er daown,&rsquo;&rdquo; sang Mr. Young.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the good old whiskey,
         Drink &lsquo;er daown!
       Here&rsquo;s to the good old whiskey,
       It makes you feel so frisky,
         Drink &lsquo;er&mdash;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Git up there, blank blank ye! What the blankety blank you stoppin&rsquo; here
      for? Git up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse was not the only creature that got up. Mrs. Calvin rose from her
      chair and gazed in horror at the window. Her husband, being already on his
      feet, could not rise but he broke off short the opening sentence of his
      &ldquo;few words&rdquo; and stared and listened. Each Welfare Worker stared and
      listened also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git up, you blankety blank blank,&rdquo; repeated Ves Young, with cheerful
      enthusiasm. Mr. Mullen, from the top of the load of lumber, caroled
      dreamily on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the good old rum,
         Drink &lsquo;er daown!
       Here&rsquo;s to the good old rum,
         Drink &lsquo;er daown!
       Here&rsquo;s to the good old rum,
       Ain&rsquo;t you glad that you&rsquo;ve got some?
       Drink &lsquo;er daown!  Drink &lsquo;er daown!
         Drink &lsquo;er daown!&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And floating, as it were, upon the waves of melody came the odor of the
      Young wagon, an odor combining deceased fish and late lamented cow and
      goodness knows what beside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dissipated vehicle stopped beneath the parlor windows of the Calvin
      cottage. Mr. Young called to his assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we be, Simp!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;A-a-ll ashore that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ashore! Wake up
      there, you unmentionably described old rum barrel and help unload this
      everlastingly condemned lumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calvin rushed to the window. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded, in
      frothing indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vessie waved at him reassuringly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Sall right, Mr. Calvin,&rdquo; he shouted.
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your lumber from Ze-lotes Snow and Co., South Harniss, Mass., U.
      S. A. &lsquo;Sall right. Let &lsquo;er go, Simp! Let &lsquo;er blankety-blank go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mullen responded with alacrity and a whoop. A half dozen boards
      crashed to the ground beneath the parlor windows. Mrs. Calvin rushed to
      her husband&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is DREADFUL, Seabury!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Send those creatures and&mdash;and
      that horrible wagon away at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Calvin tried to obey orders. He commanded Mr. Young to go
      away from there that very moment. Vessie was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this your lumber?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference whether it is or not, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell Z. Snow and Co. that this lumber&rsquo;d got to be delivered
      to-day or you&rsquo;d cancel the order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. That is my business, sir. You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Ho-o-ld on! <i>I</i> got a business, too. My business is
      deliverin&rsquo; what I&rsquo;m paid to deliver. Al Speranzy he says to me: &lsquo;Ves,&rsquo; he
      says, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t deliver that lumber to old man Calvin to-day you don&rsquo;t
      get no money, see. Will you deliver it?&rsquo; Says I, &lsquo;You bet your
      crashety-blank life I&rsquo;ll (hic) d&rsquo;liver it! What I say I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll do!&rsquo; 
      And I&rsquo;m deliverin&rsquo; it, ain&rsquo;t I? Hey? Ain&rsquo;t I? Well, then, what the&mdash;&rdquo;
       And so forth and at length, while Mrs. Calvin collapsed half fainting in
      an easy-chair, and horrified Welfare Workers covered their ears&mdash;and
      longed to cover their noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber was delivered that day. Its delivery was, from the viewpoint of
      Messrs. Young and Mullen, a success. The spring meeting of the Welfare
      Workers was not a success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day Mr. Calvin called at the office of Z. Snow and Co. He
      had things to say and said them. Captain Zelotes, who had returned from
      Boston, listened. Then he called his grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him what you&rsquo;ve just told me, Mr. Calvin,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend gentleman told it, with added details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in my opinion, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Captain Snow,&rdquo; he said, in
      conclusion, &ldquo;this young man knew what he was doing when he sent those
      drunken scoundrels to my house. He did it purposely, I am convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because&mdash;because of&mdash;of what I said to him&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;when
      I called here yesterday morning. He&mdash;I presume he took offense and&mdash;and
      this outrage is the result. I am convinced that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute. What did you say for him to take offense at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demanded that order should be delivered as promised. I am accustomed to
      do business with business men and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on just a minute more, Mr. Calvin. We don&rsquo;t seem to be gettin&rsquo; at
      the clam in this shell as fast as we&rsquo;d ought to. Al, what have you got to
      say about all this business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was white, almost as white as when he fought Sam Thatcher, but as
      he stood up to Sam so also did he face the irate clergyman. He told of the
      latter&rsquo;s visit to the office, of the threat to cancel the order unless
      delivery was promised that day, of how his promise to deliver was exacted,
      of his effort to keep that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAD to deliver it, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said hotly. &ldquo;He had all but called
      me a liar and&mdash;and by George, I wasn&rsquo;t going to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather held up a warning hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! Ssh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on with your yarn, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert told of the lame horse, of his effort to hire another team, and
      finally how in desperation he had engaged Ves Young as a last resort. The
      captain&rsquo;s face was serious but there was the twinkle under his heavy
      brows. He pulled at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Did you know Ves and Simp had been drinkin&rsquo; when you
      hired &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t. After they had gone Issy said he suspected that they
      had been drinking a little, but <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t know it. All I wanted was
      to prove to HIM,&rdquo; with a motion toward Mr. Calvin, &ldquo;that I kept my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes pulled at his beard. &ldquo;All right, Al,&rdquo; he said, after a
      moment; &ldquo;you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert went out of the private office. After he had gone the captain
      turned to his irate customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry this happened, Mr. Calvin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if Keeler or I had
      been here it probably wouldn&rsquo;t. But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as far as I can see, the
      boy did what he thought was the best thing to do. And,&rdquo; the twinkle
      reappeared in the gray eyes, &ldquo;you sartinly did get your lumber when &lsquo;twas
      promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Calvin stiffened. He had his good points, but he suffered from what
      Laban Keeler once called &ldquo;ingrowin&rsquo; importance,&rdquo; and this ailment often
      affected his judgment. Also he had to face Mrs. Calvin upon his return
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;that you are excusing that young man for
      putting that outrage upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ll, as I say, I&rsquo;m sorry it happened. But, honest, Mr. Calvin, I don&rsquo;t
      know&rsquo;s the boy&rsquo;s to blame so very much, after all. He delivered your
      lumber, and that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you have to say, Captain Snow? Is that&mdash;that impudent
      young clerk of yours to go unpunished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I guess likely he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall NEVER buy another dollar&rsquo;s worth of your house again, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes bowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to lose your trade, Mr. Calvin,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Good mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, at his desk in the outer office, was waiting rebelliously to be
      called before his grandfather and upbraided. And when so called he was in
      a mood to speak his mind. He would say a few things, no matter what
      happened in consequence. But he had no chance to say them. Captain Zelotes
      did not mention the Calvin affair to him, either that day or afterward.
      Albert waited and waited, expecting trouble, but the trouble, so far as
      his grandfather was concerned, did not materialize. He could not
      understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if in that office there was silence concerning the unusual delivery of
      the lumber for the Calvin porch, outside there was talk enough and to
      spare. Each Welfare Worker talked when she reached home and the story
      spread. Small boys shouted after Albert when he walked down the main
      street, demanding to know how Ves Young&rsquo;s cart was smellin&rsquo; these days.
      When he entered the post office some one in the crowd was almost sure to
      hum, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the good old whiskey, drink her down.&rdquo; On the train on the
      way to the picnic, girls and young fellows had slyly nagged him about it.
      The affair and its consequence were the principal causes of his mood that
      day; this particular &ldquo;Portygee streak&rdquo; was due to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path along the edge of the high bluff entered a grove of scraggy pitch
      pines about a mile from the lighthouse and the picnic ground. Albert
      stalked gloomily through the shadows of the little grove and emerged on
      the other side. There he saw another person ahead of him on the path. This
      other person was a girl. He recognized her even at this distance. She was
      Helen Kendall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and he had not been quite as friendly of late. Not that there was any
      unfriendliness between them, but she was teaching in the primary school
      and, as her father had not been well, spent most of her evenings at home.
      During the early part of the winter he had called occasionally but,
      somehow, it had seemed to him that she was not quite as cordial, or as
      interested in his society and conversation as she used to be. It was but a
      slight indifference on her part, perhaps, but Albert Speranza was not
      accustomed to indifference on the part of his feminine acquaintances. So
      he did not call again. He had seen her at the picnic ground and they had
      spoken, but not at any length.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did not care to speak with her now. He had left the pavilion
      because of his desire to be alone, and that desire still persisted.
      However, she was some little distance ahead of him and he waited in the
      edge of the grove until she should go over the crest of the little hill at
      the next point.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not go over the crest. Instead, when she reached it, she
      walked to the very edge of the bluff and stood there looking off at the
      ocean. The sea breeze ruffled her hair and blew her skirts about her and
      she made a pretty picture. But to Albert it seemed that she was standing
      much too near the edge. She could not see it, of course, but from where he
      stood he could see that the bank at that point was much undercut by the
      winter rains and winds, and although the sod looked firm enough from
      above, in reality there was little to support it. Her standing there made
      him a trifle uneasy and he had a mind to shout and warn her. He hesitated,
      however, and as he watched she stepped back of her own accord. He turned,
      re-entered the grove and started to walk back to the pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely done so when he heard a short scream followed by a thump
      and a rumbling, rattling sound. He turned like a flash, his heart pounding
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bluff edge was untenanted. A semi-circular section of the sod where
      Helen had stood was missing. From the torn opening where it had been rose
      a yellow cloud of dust.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A goodly number of the South Harniss &ldquo;natives,&rdquo; those who had not seen him
      play tennis, would have been willing to swear that running was, for Albert
      Speranza, an impossibility. His usual gait was a rather languid saunter.
      They would have changed their minds had they seen him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran along that path as he had run in school at the last track meet,
      where he had been second in the hundred-yard dash. He reached the spot
      where the sod had broken and, dropping on his knees, looked fearfully
      over. The dust was still rising, the sand and pebbles were still rattling
      in a diminishing shower down to the beach so far below. But he did not see
      what he had so feared to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did see, however, was neither pleasant nor altogether reassuring.
      The bluff below the sod at its top dropped sheer and undercut for perhaps
      ten feet. Then the sand and clay sloped outward and the slope extended
      down for another fifty feet, its surface broken by occasional clinging
      chunks of beach grass. Then it broke sharply again, a straight drop of
      eighty feet to the mounds and dunes bordering the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen had of course fallen straight to the upper edge of the slope, where
      she had struck feet first, and from there had slid and rolled to the very
      edge of the long drop to the beach. Her skirt had caught in the branches
      of an enterprising bayberry bush which had managed to find roothold there,
      and to this bush and a clump of beach grass she was clinging, her hands
      outstretched and her body extended along the edge of the clay precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; he called breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head and looked up at him. Her face was white, but she did
      not scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; cried Albert, again. &ldquo;Helen, do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you badly hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you hold on just as you are for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to, you know. Here! You&rsquo;re not going to faint, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t! You mustn&rsquo;t! Here! Don&rsquo;t you do it! Stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was just a trace of his grandfather in the way he shouted the order.
      Whether or not the vigor of the command produced the result is a question,
      but at any rate she did not faint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you stay right where you are,&rdquo; he ordered again. &ldquo;And hang on as
      tight as you can. I&rsquo;m coming down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Come down he did, swinging over the brink with his face to the bank,
      dropping on his toes to the upper edge of the slope and digging boots and
      fingers into the clay to prevent sliding further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; he cautioned, over his shoulder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there in a second.
      There! Now wait until I get my feet braced. Now give me your hand&mdash;your
      left hand. Hold on with your right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and cautiously, clinging to his hand, he pulled her away from the
      edge of the precipice and helped her to scramble up to where he clung.
      There she lay and panted. He looked at her apprehensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and faint now, or any foolishness like that,&rdquo; he ordered
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll try not to. But how are we ever going to climb up&mdash;up
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Above them and at least four feet out of reach, even if they stood up, and
      that would be a frightfully risky proceeding, the sod projected over their
      heads like the eaves of a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen glanced up at it and shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how CAN we?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t. And we won&rsquo;t try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we call for help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much use. Nobody to hear us. Besides, we can always do that if we
      have to. I think I see a way out of the mess. If we can&rsquo;t get up, perhaps
      we can get down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get DOWN?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it isn&rsquo;t all as steep as it is here. I believe we might sort of
      zig-zag down if we were careful. You hold on here just as you are; I&rsquo;m
      going to see what it looks like around this next point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;point&rdquo; was merely a projection of the bluff about twenty feet away.
      He crawfished along the face of the slope, until he could see beyond it.
      Helen kept urging him to be careful&mdash;oh, be careful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to break my
      neck. Yes&mdash;yes, by George, it IS easier around there! We could get
      down a good way. Here, here; don&rsquo;t start until you take my hand. And be
      sure your feet are braced before you move. Come on, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can. You&rsquo;ve GOT to. Come on. Don&rsquo;t look down. Look at the
      sand right in front of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Getting around that point was a decidedly ticklish operation, but they
      managed it, he leading the way, making sure of his foothold before moving
      and then setting her foot in the print his own had made. On the other side
      of the projection the slope was less abrupt and extended much nearer to
      the ground below. They zigzagged down until nearly to the edge of the
      steep drop. Then Albert looked about for a new path to safety. He found it
      still farther on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes us down farther,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and there are bushes to hold on to
      after we get there. Come on, Helen! Brace up now, be a sport!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trying her best to obey orders, but being a sport was no slight
      undertaking under the circumstances. When they reached the clump of bushes
      her guide ordered her to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just stop and catch your breath,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rest is going to be
      easier, I think. And we haven&rsquo;t so very far to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too optimistic. It was anything but easy; in fact, the last thirty
      feet was almost a tumble, owing to the clay giving way beneath their feet.
      But there was soft sand to tumble into and they reached the beach safe,
      though in a dishevelled, scratched and thoroughly smeared condition. Then
      Helen sat down and covered her face with her hands. Her rescuer gazed
      triumphantly up at the distant rim of broken sod and grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, by George!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We did it, didn&rsquo;t we? Say, that was
      fun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She removed her hands and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT did you say it was?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said it was fun. It was great! Like something out of a book, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to laugh hysterically. He turned to her in indignant surprise.
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t, please! Just let me laugh. If I don&rsquo;t laugh I shall
      cry, and I don&rsquo;t want to do that. Just don&rsquo;t talk to me for a few minutes,
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the few minutes were over she rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we must get back to the pavilion, I suppose,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My, but we
      are sights, though! Do let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t make ourselves a little more
      presentable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did her best to wipe off the thickest of the clay smears with her
      handkerchief, but the experiment was rather a failure. As they started to
      walk back along the beach she suddenly turned to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you how&mdash;how much obliged I am for&mdash;for what you
      did. If you hadn&rsquo;t come, I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he answered lightly. He was reveling in the
      dramatic qualities of the situation. She did not speak again for some time
      and he, too, walked on in silence enjoying his day dream. Suddenly he
      became aware that she was looking at him steadily and with an odd
      expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Why do you look at me that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was, as usual, direct and frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking about you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was thinking that I must have
      been mistaken, partly mistaken, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistaken? About me, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I had made up my mind that you were&mdash;well, one sort of fellow,
      and now I see that you are an entirely different sort. That is, you&rsquo;ve
      shown that you can be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure I had better not say it. You
      won&rsquo;t like it, and will think I had better mind my own affairs&mdash;which
      I should do, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on; say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him again, evidently deliberating whether or not to speak
      her thought. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will say it. Not that it is really my business, but because in a
      way it is begging your pardon, and I ought to do that. You see, I had
      begun to believe that you were&mdash;that you were&mdash;well, that you
      were not very&mdash;very active, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Active? Say, look here, Helen! What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t wonder you don&rsquo;t understand. I mean that you were rather&mdash;rather
      fond of not doing much&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Not doing much? That I was lazy, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not exactly lazy, perhaps, but&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, how CAN I say
      just what I mean! I mean that you were always saying that you didn&rsquo;t like
      the work in your grandfather&rsquo;s office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that some day you were going to do something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write or act or do something&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s true, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t, you know. You don&rsquo;t do anything. You&rsquo;ve been talking that
      way ever since I knew you, calling this a one-horse town and saying how
      you hated it, and that you weren&rsquo;t going to waste your life here, and all
      that, but you keep staying here and doing just the same things. The last
      long talk we had together you told me you knew you could write poems and
      plays and all sorts of things, you just felt that you could. You were
      going to begin right away. You said that some months ago, and you haven&rsquo;t
      done any writing at all. Now, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. No, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I shan&rsquo;t by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t begin as you said you would. That was last spring, more
      than a year ago, and I don&rsquo;t believe you have tried to write a single
      poem. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to be ruffled. It was quite unusual for any one, most of
      all for a girl, to talk to him in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I have,&rdquo; he said loftily. &ldquo;And, anyway, I don&rsquo;t see
      that it is&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business whether you have or not. I know it isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sorry I spoke.
      But, you see, I&mdash;Oh, well, never mind. And I do want you to know how
      much I appreciate your helping me as you did just now. I don&rsquo;t know how to
      thank you for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But thanks were not exactly what he wanted at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and say the rest,&rdquo; he ordered, after a short pause. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said
      so much that you had better finish it, seems to me. I&rsquo;m lazy, you think.
      What else am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re brave, awfully brave, and you are so strong and quick&mdash;yes,
      and&mdash;and&mdash;masterful; I think that is the right word. You ordered
      me about as if I were a little girl. I didn&rsquo;t want to keep still, as you
      told me to; I wanted to scream. And I wanted to faint, too, but you
      wouldn&rsquo;t let me. I had never seen you that way before. I didn&rsquo;t know you
      could be like that. That is what surprises me so. That is why I said you
      were so different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was balm for wounded pride. Albert&rsquo;s chin lifted. &ldquo;Oh, that was
      nothing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whatever had to be done must be done right off, I
      could see that. You couldn&rsquo;t hang on where you were very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I could not. But <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t
      think WHAT to do, and you could. Yes, and did it, and made me do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chin lifted still more and the Speranza chest began to expand. Helen&rsquo;s
      next remark was in the natures of a reducer for the said expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could be so prompt and strong and&mdash;and energetic then,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help wondering why you aren&rsquo;t like that all the time. I had
      begun to think you were just&mdash;just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lazy, eh?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, no-o, but careless and indifferent and with not much
      ambition, certainly. You had talked so much about writing and yet you
      never tried to write anything, that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you thought I was all bluff. Thanks! Any more compliments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him impulsively. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!
      I know what I am saying sounds perfectly horrid, and especially now when
      you have just saved me from being badly hurt, if not killed. But don&rsquo;t you
      see that&mdash;that I am saying it because I am interested in you and sure
      you COULD do so much if you only would? If you would only try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech was a compound of sweet and bitter. Albert characteristically
      selected the sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he asked, in his most confidential tone, &ldquo;would you like to have
      me try and write something? Say, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I would. Oh, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if YOU asked me I might. For your sake, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and stamped her foot impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, DON&rsquo;T be silly!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do it for my
      sake. I want you to do it for your own sake. Yes, and for your
      grandfather&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s sake! Great Scott, why do you drag him in? HE doesn&rsquo;t
      want me to write poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants you to do something, to succeed. I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants me to stay here and help Labe Keeler and Issy Price. He wants me
      to spend all my life in that office of his; that&rsquo;s what HE wants. Now hold
      on, Helen! I&rsquo;m not saying anything against the old fellow. He doesn&rsquo;t like
      me, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DON&rsquo;T know. He does like you. Or he wants to like you very much
      indeed. He would like to have you carry on the Snow Company&rsquo;s business
      after he has gone, but if you can&rsquo;t&mdash;or won&rsquo;t&mdash;do that, I know
      he would be very happy to see you succeed at anything&mdash;anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed scornfully. &ldquo;Even at writing poetry?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, at writing; although of course he doesn&rsquo;t know a thing about it
      and can&rsquo;t understand how any one can possibly earn a living that way. He
      has read or heard about poets and authors starving in garrets and he
      thinks they&rsquo;re all like that. But if you could only show him and prove to
      him that you could succeed by writing, he would be prouder of you than any
      one else would be. I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her curiously. &ldquo;You seem to know a lot about my grandfather,&rdquo;
       he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do know something about him. He and I have been friends ever since I
      was a little girl, and I like him very much indeed. If he were my
      grandfather I should be proud of him. And I think you ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed the last sentence at him in a sudden heat of enthusiasm. He
      was surprised at her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee! You ARE strong for the old chap, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well,
      admitting that he is all right, just why should I be proud of him? I AM
      proud of my father, of course; he was somebody in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he was somebody just because he was celebrated and lots of
      people knew about him. Celebrated people aren&rsquo;t the only ones who do worth
      while things. If I were you, I should be proud of Captain Zelotes because
      he is what he has made himself. Nobody helped him; he did it all. He was a
      sea captain and a good one. He has been a business man and a good one,
      even if the business isn&rsquo;t so very big. Everybody here in South Harniss&mdash;yes,
      and all up and down the Cape&mdash;knows of him and respects him. My
      father says in all the years he has preached in his church he has never
      heard a single person as much as hint that Captain Snow wasn&rsquo;t absolutely
      honest, absolutely brave, and the same to everybody, rich or poor. And all
      his life he has worked and worked hard. What HE has belongs to him; he has
      earned it. That&rsquo;s why I should be proud of him if he were my grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her enthusiasm had continued all through this long speech. Albert
      whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Regular cheer for Zelotes, fellows! One&mdash;two&mdash;!
      Grandfather&rsquo;s got one person to stand up for him, I&rsquo;ll say that. But why
      this sudden outbreak about him, anyhow? It was me you were talking about
      in the beginning&mdash;though I didn&rsquo;t notice any loud calls for cheers in
      that direction,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ignored the last part of the speech. &ldquo;I think you yourself made me
      think of him,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Sometimes you remind me of him. Not often,
      but once in a while. Just now, when we were climbing down that awful place
      you seemed almost exactly like him. The way you knew just what to do all
      the time, and your not hesitating a minute, and the way you took command
      of the situation and,&rdquo; with a sudden laugh, &ldquo;bossed me around; every bit
      of that was like him, and not like you at all. Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she
      added hurriedly. &ldquo;I mean it wasn&rsquo;t like you as you usually are. It was
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, I must say&mdash;See here, Helen Kendall, what is it you
      expect me to do; sail in and write two or three sonnets and a &lsquo;Come Into
      the Garden, Maud,&rsquo; some time next week? You&rsquo;re terribly keen about
      Grandfather, but he has rather got the edge on me so far as age goes. He&rsquo;s
      in the sixties, and I&rsquo;m just about nineteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he was nineteen he was first mate of a ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I&rsquo;ve heard him say. Maybe first-mating is a little bit easier
      than writing poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And maybe it isn&rsquo;t. At any rate, he didn&rsquo;t know whether it was easy or
      not until he tried. Oh, THAT&rsquo;S what I would like to see you do&mdash;TRY
      to do something. You could do it, too, almost anything you tried, I do
      believe. I am confident you could. But&mdash;Oh, well, as you said at the
      beginning, it isn&rsquo;t my business at all, and I&rsquo;ve said ever and ever so
      much more than I meant to. Please forgive me, if you can. I think my
      tumble and all the rest must have made me silly. I&rsquo;m sorry, Albert. There
      are the steps up to the pavilion. See them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was tramping on beside her, his hands in his pockets. He did not look
      at the long flight of steps which had suddenly come into view around the
      curve of the bluff. When he did look up and speak it was in a different
      tone, some such tone as she had heard him use during her rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, with decision, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you whether I can try or
      not. I know you think I won&rsquo;t, but I will. I&rsquo;m going up to my room
      to-night and I&rsquo;m going to try to write something or other. It may be the
      rottenest poem that ever was ground out, but I&rsquo;ll grind it if it kills
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was pleased, that was plain, but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-night, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To-night, after the picnic, is Father&rsquo;s
      reception at the church. Of course you&rsquo;ll come to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t. Look here, you&rsquo;ve called me lazy and indifferent and a
      hundred other pet names this afternoon. Well, this evening I&rsquo;ll make you
      take some of &lsquo;em back. Reception be hanged! I&rsquo;m going to write to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening both Mrs. Snow and Rachel Ellis were much disturbed because
      Albert, pleading a headache, begged off from attendance at the reception
      to the Reverend Mr. Kendall. Either, or both ladies would have been only
      too willing to remain at home and nurse the sufferer through his attack,
      but he refused to permit the sacrifice on their part. After they had gone
      his headache disappeared and, supplied with an abundance of paper, pens
      and ink, he sat down at the table in his room to invoke the Muse. The
      invocation lasted until three A. M. At that hour, with a genuine headache,
      but a sense of triumph which conquered pain, Albert climbed into bed. Upon
      the table lay a poem, a six stanza poem, having these words at its head:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        TO MY LADY&rsquo;S SPRING HAT
           By A. M. Speranza.
</pre>
    <p>
      The following forenoon he posted that poem to the editor of The Cape Cod
      Item. And three weeks later it appeared in the pages of that journal. Of
      course there was no pecuniary recompense for its author, and the fact was
      indisputable that the Item was generally only too glad to publish
      contributions which helped to fill its columns. But, nevertheless, Albert
      Speranza had written a poem and that poem had been published.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was Rachel who first discovered &ldquo;To My Lady&rsquo;s Spring Hat&rdquo; in the Item
      three weeks later. She came rushing into the sitting room brandishing the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul! My soul! My soul!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive, sitting sewing by the window, was, naturally, somewhat startled.
      &ldquo;Mercy on us, Rachel!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What IS it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried the housekeeper, pointing to the contribution in the &ldquo;Poets&rsquo; 
      Corner&rdquo; as Queen Isabella may have pointed at the evidence of her proteges
      discovery of a new world. &ldquo;LOOK!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow looked, read the verses to herself, and then aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I declare, they&rsquo;re real sort of pretty, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
      in astonished admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty! They&rsquo;re perfectly elegant! And right here in the paper for all
      hands to see. Ain&rsquo;t you PROUD of him, Mrs. Snow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive had been growing more and more proud of her handsome grandson ever
      since his arrival. She was prouder still now and said so. Rachel nodded,
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a Robert Penfold afore he dies, or I miss MY guess!&rdquo; she
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed it to feminine acquaintances all over town, and Olive, when
      callers came, took pains to see that a copy of the Item, folded with the
      &ldquo;Poets&rsquo; Corner&rdquo; uppermost, lay on the center table. Customers, dropping in
      at the office, occasionally mentioned the poem to its author.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you had a piece in the Item, Al,&rdquo; was their usual way of referring to
      it. &ldquo;Pretty cute piece &lsquo;twas, too, seemed to me. Say, that girl of yours
      must have SOME spring bunnit. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar deigned to express approval, approval qualified with discerning
      criticism of course, but approval nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good piece, Al,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Pretty good. Glad to see you done
      so well. Course you made one little mistake, but &lsquo;twan&rsquo;t a very big one.
      That part where you said&mdash;What was it, now? Where&rsquo;d I put that piece
      of poetry? Oh, yes, here &lsquo;tis! Where you said&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;It floats upon her golden curls
      As froth upon the wave.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Now of course nothin&rsquo;&mdash;a hat or nothin&rsquo; else&mdash;is goin&rsquo; to float
      on top of a person&rsquo;s head. Froth floatin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s all right, you
      understand; but even if you took froth right out of the water and slapped
      it up onto anybody&rsquo;s hair &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t FLOAT up there. If you&rsquo;d said,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;It SETS up onto her golden curls,
      Same as froth sets on top of a wave.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      that would have been all right and true. But there, don&rsquo;t feel bad about
      it. It&rsquo;s only a little mistake, same as anybody&rsquo;s liable to make. Nine
      persons out of ten wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed it. I&rsquo;m extry partic&rsquo;lar, I
      presume likely. I&rsquo;m findin&rsquo; mistakes like that all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban&rsquo;s comment was less critical, perhaps, but more reserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty good, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;yes, sir, it&rsquo;s pretty
      good. It ain&rsquo;t all new, there&rsquo;s some of it that&rsquo;s been written before, but
      I rather guess that might have been said about Shakespeare&rsquo;s poetry when
      he fust commenced. It&rsquo;s pretty good, Al. Yes&mdash;yes, yes. It is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was inclined to resent the qualified strain in the bookkeeper&rsquo;s
      praise. He was tempted to be sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;of course you&rsquo;ve read so much real poetry that you
      ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban nodded, slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read a good deal,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Readin&rsquo; 
      is one of the few things I ain&rsquo;t made a failure of in this life. Um-hm.
      One of the few. Yes yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dipped his pen in the inkwell and carefully made an entry in the
      ledger. His assistant felt a sudden pang of compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Keeler,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was pretty fresh of me.
      I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban looked up in mild surprise. &ldquo;Sorry?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What for? . . .
      Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Al, that&rsquo;s all right. Lord knows I&rsquo;m the last one on
      earth who&rsquo;d ought to criticize anybody. All I had in mind in sayin&rsquo; what I
      did was to&mdash;well, to kind of keep you from bein&rsquo; too well satisfied
      and not try harder on the next one. It don&rsquo;t pay to be too well satisfied.
      . . . Years ago, I can remember, <i>I</i> was pretty well satisfied&mdash;with
      myself and my work. Sounds like a joke, I know, but &lsquo;twas so. . . . Well,
      I&rsquo;ve had a nice long chance to get over it. Um-hm. Yes&mdash;yes. So I
      have, so I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only Captain Zelotes at first said nothing about the poem. He read it, his
      wife saw to that, but his comment even to her was a non-committal grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s real sort of pretty, Zelotes?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain grunted again. &ldquo;Why, I guess likely &lsquo;tis if you say so,
      Mother. I don&rsquo;t know much about such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But everybody says it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know! Well, then &lsquo;twon&rsquo;t make much difference whether I say it or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to say a word to Albert about it, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, say you like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, and if I do he&rsquo;ll keep on writin&rsquo; more. That&rsquo;s exactly what I
      don&rsquo;t want him to do. Come now, Mother, be sensible. This piece of his may
      be good or it may not, <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t undertake to say. But this I do
      know: I don&rsquo;t want the boy to spend his time writin&rsquo; poetry slush for that
      &lsquo;Poets&rsquo; Corner.&rsquo; Letitia Makepeace did that&mdash;she had a piece in there
      about every week&mdash;and she died in the Taunton asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Zelotes, it wasn&rsquo;t her poetry got her into the asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wan&rsquo;t it? Well, she was in the poorhouse afore that. I don&rsquo;t know whether
      &lsquo;twas her poetryin&rsquo; that got her in there, but I know darned well it
      didn&rsquo;t get her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to say one word? &lsquo;Twould encourage him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! We don&rsquo;t want to encourage him, do we? If he was takin&rsquo; to
      thievin&rsquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t encourage him in that, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thievin&rsquo;! Zelotes Snow, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you compare a poet to a
      THIEF!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain grinned. &ldquo;No-o, Mother,&rdquo; he observed drily. &ldquo;Sometimes a thief
      can manage to earn a livin&rsquo; at his job. But there, there, don&rsquo;t feel bad.
      I&rsquo;ll say somethin&rsquo; to Al, long&rsquo;s you think I ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The something was not much, and yet Captain Zelotes really meant it to be
      kindly and to sound like praise. But praising a thing of which you have
      precious little understanding and with which you have absolutely no
      sympathy is a hard job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you had a piece in the Item this week, Al,&rdquo; observed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. I read it. I don&rsquo;t know much about such things, but they tell me
      it is pretty good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, you&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Perhaps considering its source it was a good deal, but
      Albert was not of the age where such considerations are likely to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s praise was warm and enthusiastic. &ldquo;I knew you could do it if you
      only would,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;And oh, I&rsquo;m SO glad you did! Now you must keep
      on trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That bit of advice was quite superfluous. Young Speranza having sampled
      the sublime intoxication of seeing himself in print, was not ready to
      sober off yet a while. He continued to bombard the Item with verses. They
      were invariably accepted, but when he sent to a New York magazine a poem
      which he considered a gem, the promptness with which it was returned
      staggered his conceit and was in that respect a good thing for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he kept on trying. Helen would not have permitted him to give up
      even if he had wished. She was quite as much interested in his literary
      aspirations as he was himself and her encouragement was a great help to
      him. After months of repeated trial and repeated rejection he opened an
      envelope bearing the name of a fairly well-known periodical to find
      therein a kindly note stating that his poem, &ldquo;Sea Spaces&rdquo; had been
      accepted. And a week later came a check for ten dollars. That was a day of
      days. Incidentally it was the day of a trial balance in the office and the
      assistant bookkeeper&rsquo;s additions and multiplications contained no less
      than four ghastly errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon there was an interview in the back office. Captain
      Zelotes and his grandson were the participants. The subject discussed was
      &ldquo;Business versus Poetry,&rdquo; and there was a marked difference of opinion.
      Albert had proclaimed his triumph at home, of course, had exhibited his
      check, had been the recipient of hugs and praises from his grandmother and
      had listened to paeans and hallelujahs from Mrs. Ellis. When he hurried
      around to the parsonage after supper, Helen had been excited and delighted
      at the good news. Albert had been patted on the back quite as much as was
      good for a young man whose bump of self-esteem was not inclined toward
      under-development. When he entered the private office of Z. Snow and Co.
      in answer to his grandfather&rsquo;s summons, he did so light-heartedly,
      triumphantly, with self-approval written large upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he came like a conquering hero, he was not received like one.
      Captain Zelotes sat at his desk, the copy of the Boston morning paper
      which he had been reading sticking out of the waste basket into which it
      had been savagely jammed a half hour before. The news had not been to the
      captain&rsquo;s liking. These were the September days of 1914; the German Kaiser
      was marching forward &ldquo;mit Gott&rdquo; through Belgium, and it began to look as
      if he could not be stopped short of Paris. Consequently, Captain Zelotes,
      his sympathies from the first with England and the Allies, was not happy
      in his newspaper reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert entered, head erect and eyes shining. If Gertie Kendrick could have
      seen him then she would have fallen down and worshiped. His grandfather
      looked at him in silence for a moment, tapping his desk with the stump of
      a pencil. Albert, too, was silent; he was already thinking of another poem
      with which to dazzle the world, and his head was among the rosy clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Al,&rdquo; said Captain Zelotes shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert reluctantly descended to earth and took the battered armchair
      standing beside the desk. The captain tapped with his pencil upon the
      figure-covered sheet of paper before him. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al, you&rsquo;ve been here three years come next December, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, sir, I believe I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm, you have. And for the heft of that time you&rsquo;ve been in this
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And Labe Keeler and I have been doin&rsquo; our best to make a business
      man out of you. You understand we have, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked puzzled and a little uneasy. Into his roseate dreams was
      just beginning to filter the idea that his grandfather&rsquo;s tone and manner
      were peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir, of course I understand it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I asked you because I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure whether you did or not. Can
      you guess what this is I&rsquo;ve got on my desk here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tapped the figure-covered sheet of paper once more. Before Albert could
      speak the captain answered his own question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the latest samples of
      your smartness as a business man. I presume likely you know that Laban
      worked here in this office until three o&rsquo;clock this mornin&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not know it. Mr. Keeler had told him nothing of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Did he? What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, he did. And what for? Why, just to find out what was the matter
      with his trial balance, that&rsquo;s all. When one of Labe&rsquo;s trial balances
      starts out for snug harbor and ends up on a reef with six foot of water in
      her hold, naturally Labe wants to get her afloat and pumped dry as quick
      as possible. He ain&rsquo;t used to it, for one thing, and it makes him
      nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s uneasiness grew. When his grandfather&rsquo;s speech became sarcastic
      and nautical, the young man had usually found that there was trouble
      coming for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry Laban had to stay so late,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I should
      have been glad to stay and help him, but he didn&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. Well, it may possibly be that he cal&rsquo;lated he was carryin&rsquo; about
      all your help that the craft would stand, as &lsquo;twas. Any more might sink
      her. See here, young feller&mdash;&rdquo; Captain Zelotes dropped his quiet
      sarcasm and spoke sharp and brisk: &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you realize
      that this sheet of paper I&rsquo;ve got here is what stands for a day&rsquo;s work
      done by you yesterday? And on this sheet there was no less than four silly
      mistakes that a child ten years old hadn&rsquo;t ought to make, that an
      able-bodied idiot hadn&rsquo;t ought to make. But YOU made &lsquo;em, and they kept
      Labe Keeler here till three o&rsquo;clock this mornin&rsquo;. Now what have you got to
      say for yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Albert had very little to say, except that he was
      sorry, and that his grandfather evidently did not consider worth the
      saying. He waved the protestation aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; he repeated impatiently. &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re sorry, though even at
      that I ain&rsquo;t sure you&rsquo;re sorry enough. Labe was sorry, too, I don&rsquo;t doubt,
      when his bedtime went by and he kept runnin&rsquo; afoul of one of your mistakes
      after another. I&rsquo;m sorry, darned sorry, to find out that you can make such
      blunders after three years on board here under such teachin&rsquo; as you&rsquo;ve
      had. But bein&rsquo; sorry don&rsquo;t help any to speak of. Any fool can be sorry for
      his foolishness, but if that&rsquo;s all, it don&rsquo;t help a whole lot. Is bein&rsquo; 
      sorry the best excuse you&rsquo;ve got to offer? What made you make the mistakes
      in the first place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s face was darkly red under the lash of his grandfather&rsquo;s tongue.
      Captain Zelotes and he had had disagreements and verbal encounters before,
      but never since they had been together had the captain spoken like this.
      And the young fellow was no longer seventeen, he was twenty. The flush
      began to fade from his cheeks and the pallor which meant the rise of the
      Speranza temper took its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you make such fool blunders?&rdquo; repeated the captain. &ldquo;You knew
      better, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sullenly, &ldquo;I suppose I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know mighty well you did. And as nigh as I can larn from what I got
      out of Laban&mdash;which wasn&rsquo;t much; I had to pump it out of him word by
      word&mdash;this ain&rsquo;t the first set of mistakes you&rsquo;ve made. You make &lsquo;em
      right along. If it wasn&rsquo;t for him helpin&rsquo; you out and coverin&rsquo; up your
      mistakes, this firm would be in hot water with its customers two-thirds of
      the time and the books would be fust-rate as a puzzle, somethin&rsquo; to use
      for a guessin&rsquo; match, but plaguey little good as straight accounts of a
      goin&rsquo; concern. Now what makes you act this way? Eh? What makes you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. See here, Grandfather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a minute. You don&rsquo;t know, eh? Well, I know. It ain&rsquo;t because you
      ain&rsquo;t smart enough to keep a set of books and keep &lsquo;em well. I don&rsquo;t
      expect you to be a Labe Keeler; there ain&rsquo;t many bookkeepers like him on
      this earth. But I do know you&rsquo;re smart enough to keep my books and keep
      &lsquo;em as they&rsquo;d ought to be, if you want to keep &lsquo;em. The trouble with you
      is that you don&rsquo;t want to. You&rsquo;ve got too much of your good-for-nothin&mdash;&rdquo;
       Captain Lote pulled up short, cleared his throat, and went on: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
      too much &lsquo;poet&rsquo; in you,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert leaned forward. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what you were going to say,&rdquo; he said
      quickly. &ldquo;You were going to say that I had too much of my father in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the captain&rsquo;s turn to redden. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I&mdash;How
      do you know what I was goin&rsquo; to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I do. You say it all the time. Or, if you don&rsquo;t say it, you look
      it. There is hardly a day that I don&rsquo;t catch you looking at me as if you
      were expecting me to commit murder or do some outrageous thing or other.
      And I know, too, that it is all because I&rsquo;m my father&rsquo;s son. Well, that&rsquo;s
      all right; feel that way about me if you want to, I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here, Al! Hold on! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hold on. And I tell you this: I hate this work here. You say I
      don&rsquo;t want to keep books. Well, I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sorry I made the errors
      yesterday and put Keeler to so much trouble, but I&rsquo;ll probably make more.
      No,&rdquo; with a sudden outburst of determination, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make any more. I
      won&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;m not going to keep books any more. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re what?&rdquo; he asked slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through. I&rsquo;ll never work in this office another day. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s brows drew together as he stared steadily at his grandson.
      He slowly tugged at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted, after a moment. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re through, eh? Goin&rsquo; to quit
      and go somewheres else, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. I see. Where are you goin&rsquo; to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m not going to make a fool of myself at this job any
      longer. I can&rsquo;t keep books, and I won&rsquo;t keep them. I hate business. I&rsquo;m no
      good at it. And I won&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. I see. Well, if you won&rsquo;t keep on in business, what will you do
      for a livin&rsquo;? Write poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m. Be kind of slim livin&rsquo;, won&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;ve been writin&rsquo; poetry for
      about a year and a half, as I recollect, and so far you&rsquo;ve made ten
      dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. If I don&rsquo;t make it I may starve, as you are always
      saying that writers do. But, starve or not, I shan&rsquo;t ask YOU to take care
      of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken care of you for three years or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But you did it because&mdash;because&mdash;Well, I don&rsquo;t know why
      you did, exactly, but you won&rsquo;t have to do it any longer. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain still stared steadily, and what he saw in the dark eyes which
      flashed defiance back at him seemed to trouble him a little. His tugs at
      his beard became more strenuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Humph! . . . Well, Al, of course I can&rsquo;t make you
      stay by main force. Perhaps I could&mdash;you ain&rsquo;t of age yet&mdash;but I
      shan&rsquo;t. And you want to quit the ship altogether, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean this office&mdash;yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see. Want to quit South Harniss and your grandmother&mdash;and
      Rachel&mdash;and Labe&mdash;and Helen&mdash;and all the rest of &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly. But I shall have to, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. . . . Um-hm. . . . Yes. Have you thought how your grandmother&rsquo;s
      liable to feel when she hears you are goin&rsquo; to clear out and leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had not thought in that way, but he did now. His tone was a trifle
      less combative as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be sorry at first, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;ll get over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Maybe she will. You can get over &lsquo;most anything in time&mdash;&lsquo;MOST
      anything. Well, and how about me? How do you think I&rsquo;ll feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s chin lifted. &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll be mighty glad of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes picked up the pencil stump and twirled it in his fingers.
      &ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You think I will, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will. You don&rsquo;t like me, and never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard you say. Well, boy, don&rsquo;t you cal&rsquo;late I like you at least
      as much as you like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What do you mean? I like you well enough. That is, I should if you
      gave me half a chance. But you don&rsquo;t do it. You hate me because my father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain interrupted. His big palm struck the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T say that again!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Look here, if I hated you do you
      suppose I&rsquo;d be talkin&rsquo; to you like this? If I hated you do you cal&rsquo;late
      I&rsquo;d argue when you gave me notice? Not by a jugful! No man ever came to me
      and said he was goin&rsquo; to quit and had me beg him to stay. If we was at sea
      he stayed until we made port; then he WENT, and he didn&rsquo;t hang around
      waitin&rsquo; for a boat to take him ashore neither. I don&rsquo;t hate you, son. I&rsquo;d
      ask nothin&rsquo; better than a chance to like you, but you won&rsquo;t give it to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s eyes and mouth opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> won&rsquo;t give YOU a chance?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. DO you give me one? I ask you to keep these books of mine. You
      could keep &lsquo;em A Number One. You&rsquo;re smart enough to do it. But you won&rsquo;t.
      You let &lsquo;em go to thunder and waste your time makin&rsquo; up fool poetry and
      such stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I like writing, and I don&rsquo;t like keeping books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keepin&rsquo; books is a part of l&rsquo;arnin&rsquo; the business, and business is the way
      you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to get your livin&rsquo; by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. I am going to be a writer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now DON&rsquo;T say that silly thing again! I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall say it because it is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, boy: When I tell you or anybody else in this office to do or
      not to do a thing, I expect &lsquo;em to obey orders. And I tell you not to talk
      any more of that foolishness about bein&rsquo; a writer. D&rsquo;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, that much is settled. . . . Here! Where are you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had turned and was on his way out of the office. He stopped and
      answered over his shoulder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; HOME? Why, you came from home not more than an hour and a half ago!
      What are you goin&rsquo; there again now for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pack up my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pack up your things! To pack up&mdash;Humph! So you really mean it!
      You&rsquo;re really goin&rsquo; to quit me like this? And your grandma, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man felt a sudden pang of compunction, a twinge of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the change in his attitude and tone came too late. Captain Lote&rsquo;s
      temper was boiling now, contradiction was its worst provocative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to quit!&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to quit because you don&rsquo;t like to
      work. All right, quit then! Go ahead! I&rsquo;ve done all I can to make a man of
      you. Go to the devil in your own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead! <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t stop you. It&rsquo;s in your breed, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was sufficient. Albert strode out of the private office, head erect.
      Captain Zelotes rose and slammed the door after his departing grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten that evening Albert was in his room, sitting in a chair by the
      window, gloomily looking out. The packing, most of it, had been done. He
      had not, as he told his grandfather he intended doing, left the office
      immediately and come straight home to pack. As he emerged from the inner
      office after the stormy interview with the captain he found Laban Keeler
      hard at work upon the books. The sight of the little man, so patiently and
      cheerfully pegging away, brought another twinge of conscience to the
      assistant bookkeeper. Laban had been such a brick in all their
      relationships. It must have been a sore trial to his particular,
      business-like soul, those errors in the trial balance. Yet he had not
      found fault nor complained. Captain Zelotes himself had said that every
      item concerning his grandson&rsquo;s mistakes and blunders had been dragged from
      Mr. Keeler much against the latter&rsquo;s will. Somehow Albert could not bear
      to go off and leave him at once. He would stay and finish his day&rsquo;s work,
      for Labe Keeler&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      So stay he did and when Captain Zelotes later came out of his private
      office and found him there neither of them spoke. At home, during supper,
      nothing was said concerning the quarrel of the afternoon. Yet Albert was
      as determined to leave as ever, and the Captain, judging by the expression
      of his face, was just as determined to do nothing more to prevent him.
      After supper the young man went to his room and began the packing. His
      grandfather went out, an unusual proceeding for him, saying that he
      guessed he would go down street for a spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Albert, as he sat there by the window, was gloomy enough. The wind,
      howling and wailing about the gables of the old house, was not an aid to
      cheerfulness and he needed every aid. He had sworn to go away, he was
      going away&mdash;but where should he go? He had a little money put by, not
      much but a little, which he had been saving for quite another purpose.
      This would take him a little way, would pay his bills for a short time,
      but after that&mdash;Well, after that he could earn more. With the
      optimism of youth and the serene self-confidence which was natural to him
      he was sure of succeeding sooner or later. It was not the dread of failure
      and privation which troubled him. The weight which was pressing upon his
      spirit was not the fear of what might happen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rap upon the door. Then a voice, the housekeeper&rsquo;s voice,
      whispered through the crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Al,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Ellis. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t in bed yet, are you? I&rsquo;d
      like to talk with you a minute or two, if I might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not anxious to talk to her or anyone else just then, but he told
      her to come in. She entered on tiptoe, with the mysterious air of a
      conspirator, and shut the door carefully after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I set down just a minute?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I can generally talk better
      settin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled forward the ancient rocker with the rush seat. The cross-stitch
      &ldquo;tidy&rdquo; on the back was his mother&rsquo;s handiwork, she had made it when she
      was fifteen. Rachel sat down in the rocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al&rdquo; she began, still in the same mysterious whisper, &ldquo;I know all about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her. &ldquo;All about what?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the trouble you and Cap&rsquo;n Lote had this afternoon. I know you&rsquo;re
      plannin&rsquo; to leave us all and go away somewheres and that he told you to
      go, and all that. I know what you&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; up here to-night. Fur&rsquo;s
      that goes,&rdquo; she added, with a little catch in her breath and a wave of her
      hand toward the open trunk and suitcase upon the floor, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t need
      to know, I could SEE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was surprised and confused. He had supposed the whole affair to be,
      so far, a secret between himself and his grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;You&mdash;How did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laban told me. Labe came hurryin&rsquo; over here just after supper and told me
      the whole thing. He&rsquo;s awful upset about it, Laban is. He thinks almost as
      much of you as he does of Cap&rsquo;n Lote or&mdash;or me,&rdquo; with an apologetic
      little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was astonished and troubled. &ldquo;How did Labe know about it?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He heard it all. He couldn&rsquo;t help hearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t have heard. The door to the private office was shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the window at the top&mdash;the transom one, you know&mdash;was
      wide open. You and your grandpa never thought of that, I guess, and Laban
      couldn&rsquo;t hop up off his stool and shut it without givin&rsquo; it away that he&rsquo;d
      been hearin&rsquo;. So he had to just set and listen and I know how he hated
      doin&rsquo; that. Laban Keeler ain&rsquo;t the listenin&rsquo; kind. One thing about it all
      is a mercy,&rdquo; she added, fervently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s own mercy that that
      Issy Price wasn&rsquo;t where HE could hear it, too. If Issy heard it you might
      as well paint it up on the town-hall fence; all creation and his wife
      wouldn&rsquo;t larn it any sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert drew a long breath. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
      Labe heard, but I don&rsquo;t suppose it makes much difference. Everyone will
      know all about it in a day or two . . . I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain&rsquo;t, Al,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not? Indeed I am! Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just what I say. You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay right here.
      At least I hope you are, and I THINK you are. . . . Oh, I know,&rdquo; she
      added, quickly, &ldquo;what you are goin&rsquo; to say. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to tell me that
      your grandpa is down on you on account of your father, and that you don&rsquo;t
      like bookkeepin&rsquo;, and that you want to write poetry and&mdash;and such.
      You&rsquo;ll say all that, and maybe it&rsquo;s all true, but whether &lsquo;tis or not
      ain&rsquo;t the point at all just now. The real point is that you&rsquo;re Janie
      Snow&rsquo;s son and your grandpa&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow and your grandma&rsquo;s Olive
      Snow and there ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be another smash-up in this family if I can
      help it. I&rsquo;ve been through one and one&rsquo;s enough. Albert, didn&rsquo;t you
      promise me that Sunday forenoon three years ago when I came into the
      settin&rsquo;-room and we got talkin&rsquo; about books and Robert Penfold and
      everything&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you promise me then that when things between you
      and your grandpa got kind of&mdash;of snarled up and full of knots you&rsquo;d
      come to me with &lsquo;em and we&rsquo;d see if we couldn&rsquo;t straighten &lsquo;em out
      together? Didn&rsquo;t you promise me that, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert remembered the conversation to which she referred. As he remembered
      it, however, he had not made any definite promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me to talk them over with you, Rachel,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I think
      that&rsquo;s about as far as it went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe so, but now I ask you again. Will you talk this over with me,
      Albert? Will you tell me every bit all about it, for my sake? And for your
      grandma&rsquo;s sake. . . . Yes, more&rsquo;n that, for your mother&rsquo;s sake, Albert;
      she was pretty nigh like my own sister, Jane Snow was. Different as night
      from day of course, she was pretty and educated and all that and I was
      just the same then as I am now, but we did think a lot of each other,
      Albert. Tell me the whole story, won&rsquo;t you, please. Just what Cap&rsquo;n Lote
      said and what you said and what you plan to do&mdash;and all? Please,
      Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in her eyes. He had always liked her, but it was a liking
      with a trace of condescension in it. She was peculiar, her &ldquo;sympathetic
      attacks&rdquo; were funny, and she and Laban together were an odd pair. Now he
      saw her in a new light and he felt a sudden rush of real affection for
      her. And with this feeling, and inspired also by his loneliness, came the
      impulse to comply with her request, to tell her all his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began slowly at first, but as he went on the words came quicker. She
      listened eagerly, nodding occasionally, but saying nothing. When he had
      finished she nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas almost what Laban said and about what he and I
      expected. Well, Albert, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be the one to blame you, not very
      much anyhow. I don&rsquo;t see as you are to blame; you can&rsquo;t help the way
      you&rsquo;re made. But your grandfather can&rsquo;t help bein&rsquo; made his way, either.
      He can&rsquo;t see with your spectacles and you can&rsquo;t see with his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stirred rebelliously. &ldquo;Then we had better go our own ways, I should
      say,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you hadn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s just what you mustn&rsquo;t do, not now, anyhow. As I
      said before, there&rsquo;s been enough of all hands goin&rsquo; their own ways in this
      family and look what came of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you expect me to do? I will not give up every plan I&rsquo;ve made
      and my chance in the world just because he is too stubborn and cranky to
      understand them. I will NOT do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to. But I don&rsquo;t want you to upset the whole kettle just
      because the steam has scalded your fingers. I don&rsquo;t want you to go off and
      leave your grandma to break her heart a second time and your grandpa to
      give up all his plans and hopes that he&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plans about me? He making plans about me? What sort of plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All sorts. Oh, he don&rsquo;t say much about &lsquo;em, of course; that ain&rsquo;t his
      way. But from things he&rsquo;s let drop I know he has hoped to take you in with
      him as a partner one of these days, and to leave you the business after
      he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Rachel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t nonsense. It&rsquo;s the one big dream of Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;s life. That
      Z. Snow and Co. business is his pet child, as you might say. He built it
      up, he and Labe together, and when he figgered to take you aboard with him
      &lsquo;twas SOME chance for you, &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to his lookout. Now you can&rsquo;t hardly
      blame him for bein&rsquo; disappointed when you chuck that chance away and take
      to writin&rsquo; poetry pieces, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;why, confound it, Rachel, you don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, but your grandpa don&rsquo;t. And you don&rsquo;t understand him. . . .
      Oh, Albert, DON&rsquo;T be as stubborn as he is, as your mother was&mdash;the
      Lord and she forgive me for sayin&rsquo; it. She was partly right about marryin&rsquo; 
      your pa and Cap&rsquo;n Lote was partly right, too. If they had met half way and
      put the two &lsquo;partlys&rsquo; together the whole thing might have been right in
      the end. As &lsquo;twas, &lsquo;twas all wrong. Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, DON&rsquo;T, Albert, be as
      stubborn as that. For their sakes, Al,&mdash;yes, and for my sake, for I&rsquo;m
      one of your family, too, or seems as if I was&mdash;don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastily wiped her eyes with her apron. He, too was greatly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Rachel,&rdquo; he muttered, hurriedly. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
      know you felt this way. I didn&rsquo;t know anybody did. I don&rsquo;t want to make
      trouble in the family&mdash;any more trouble. Grandmother has been awfully
      good to me; so, too, has Grandfather, I suppose, in his way. But&mdash;oh,
      what am I going to do? I can&rsquo;t stay in that office all my life. I&rsquo;m not
      good at business. I don&rsquo;t like it. I can&rsquo;t give up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, course you mustn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want you to give up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what do you want me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to go to your grandpa and talk to him once more. Not givin&rsquo; up
      your plans altogether but not forcin&rsquo; him to give up his either, not right
      away. Tell him you realize he wants you to go on with Z. Snow and Company
      and that you will&mdash;for a while&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while, I said; three or four years, say. You won&rsquo;t be so dreadful
      old then, not exactly what you&rsquo;d call a Methusalem. Tell him you&rsquo;ll do
      that and on his side he must let you write as much as you please, provided
      you don&rsquo;t let the writin&rsquo; interfere with the Z. Snow and Co. work. Then,
      at the end of the three or four years, if you still feel the same as you
      do now, you can tackle your poetry for keeps and he and you&rsquo;ll still be
      friends. Tell him that, Albert, and see what he says. . . . Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert took some moments to consider. At length he said: &ldquo;If I did I doubt
      if he would listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes he would. He&rsquo;d more than listen, I&rsquo;m pretty sartin. I think he&rsquo;d
      agree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. You see,&rdquo; with a smile, &ldquo;while I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; to you
      there&rsquo;s been somebody else talkin&rsquo; to him. . . . There, there! don&rsquo;t you
      ask any questions. I promised not to tell anybody and if I ain&rsquo;t exactly
      broke that promise, I&rsquo;ve sprained its ankle, I&rsquo;m afraid. Good night,
      Albert, and thank you ever and ever so much for listenin&rsquo; so long without
      once tellin&rsquo; me to mind my own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Rachel. . . . And thank you for taking so much interest in my
      affairs. You&rsquo;re an awfully good friend, I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t talk that way. And you WILL have that talk with your
      grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m SO glad! There! Good night. I come pretty nigh kissin&rsquo; you then
      and for a woman that&rsquo;s been engaged to be married for upwards of eighteen
      years that&rsquo;s a nice way to act, ain&rsquo;t it! Good night, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried out of the room. Albert sat down again in his chair by the
      window. He had promised to go to his grandfather and talk to him. As he
      sat there, thinking of the coming interview, he realized more and more
      that the keeping of that promise was likely to be no easy matter. He must
      begin the talk, he must break the ice&mdash;and how should he break it?
      Timid and roundabout approaches would be of little use; unless his
      grandfather&rsquo;s state of mind had changed remarkably since their parting in
      the Z. Snow and Co. office they and their motive would be misunderstood.
      No, the only way to break the ice was to break it, to plunge immediately
      into the deepest part of the subject. It promised to be a chilly plunge.
      He shivered at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour later he heard the door of the hall open and shut and knew
      that Captain Zelotes had returned. Rising, he descended the stairs. He
      descended slowly. Just as he reached the foot of the narrow flight Captain
      Zelotes entered the hall from the dining-room and turned toward him. Both
      were surprised at the meeting. Albert spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Grandfather,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was just coming down
      to see you. Were you going to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote shook his head. &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind waiting a minute? I have a few things&mdash;I have something
      to say to you and&mdash;and I guess I shall sleep better if I say it
      to-night. I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t keep you long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain regarded him intently for an instant, then he turned and led
      the way to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he ordered, laconically. Albert squared his shoulders,
      preparatory to the plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;first of all I want to tell you I am sorry for&mdash;for
      some of the things I said this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had rehearsed this opening speech over and over again, but in spite of
      the rehearsals it was dreadfully hard to make. If his grandfather had
      helped him even a little it might have been easier, but the captain merely
      stood there, expressionless, saying nothing, waiting for him to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert swallowed, clenched his fists, and took a new start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I am sorry for the mistakes I made in my
      bookkeeping, but that I have told you before. Now&mdash;now I want to say
      I am sorry for being so&mdash;well, so pig-headed about the rest of it. I
      realize that you have been mighty kind to me and that I owe you about
      everything that I&rsquo;ve got in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again. It had seemed to him that Captain Zelotes was about to
      speak. However, he did not, so the young man stumbled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and I realize, too,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you have, I guess, been
      trying to give me a real start in business, the start you think I ought to
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded slowly. &ldquo;That was my idea in startin&rsquo; you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and fact that I haven&rsquo;t done more with the chance is because
      I&rsquo;m made that way, I guess. But I do want to&mdash;yes, and I MEAN to try
      to succeed at writing poetry or stories or plays or something. I like that
      and I mean to give it a trial. And so&mdash;and so, you see, I&rsquo;ve been
      thinking our talk over and I&rsquo;ve concluded that perhaps you may be right,
      maybe I&rsquo;m not old enough to know what I really am fitted for, and yet
      perhaps <i>I</i> may be partly right, too. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been thinking that
      perhaps some sort of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of half-way arrangement&mdash;some sort of&mdash;of compromise, you
      know, might be arranged. I might agree to stay in the office and do my
      very best with bookkeeping and business for&mdash;well, say, three years
      or so. During that time I should be trying to write of course, but I would
      only do that sort of writing evenings or on Saturdays and holidays. It
      shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with your work nor be done in the time you pay me for.
      And at the end of the three or four years&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again. This time the pause was longer than ever. Captain Lote
      broke the silence. His big right hand had wandered upward and was tugging
      at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? . . . And then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;Well, then we could see. If business
      seemed to be where I was most likely to succeed we&rsquo;d call it settled and I
      would stay with Z. Snow and Co. If poetry-making or&mdash;or&mdash;literature
      seemed more likely to be the job I was fitted for, that would be the job
      I&rsquo;d take. You&mdash;you see, don&rsquo;t you, Grandfather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s beard-pulling continued. He was no longer looking his
      grandson straight in the eye. His gaze was fixed upon the braided mat at
      his feet and he answered without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I see. Well, was that all you had to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, not quite. I&mdash;I wanted to say that which ever way it turned
      out, I&mdash;I hoped we&mdash;you and I, you know&mdash;would agree to be&mdash;to
      be good-natured about it and&mdash;and friends just the same. I&mdash;I&mdash;Well,
      there! That&rsquo;s all, I guess. I haven&rsquo;t put it very well, I&rsquo;m afraid, but&mdash;but
      what do you think about it, Grandfather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now Captain Zelotes did look up. The old twinkle was in his eye. His
      first remark was a question and that question was rather surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;Al, who&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed to his grandson&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Talking to me?&rdquo; he stammered.
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean just that. You didn&rsquo;t think out this scheme all by yourself.
      Somebody&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; to you and puttin&rsquo; you up to it. Haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, Grandfather, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Well, yes, someone has been talking to me, but the whole idea
      isn&rsquo;t theirs. I WAS sorry for speaking to you as I did and sorry to think
      of leaving you and grandmother. I&mdash;I was sitting up there in my room
      and feeling blue and mean enough and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then Rachel came aboard and gave you your sailin&rsquo; orders; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert gasped. &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake how did you know that?&rdquo; he demanded.
      &ldquo;She&mdash;Why, she must have told you, after all! But she said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, boy, hold on!&rdquo; Captain Lote chuckled quietly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;Rachel didn&rsquo;t tell me; I guessed she was the one. And it didn&rsquo;t take a
      Solomon in all his glory to guess it, neither. Labe Keeler&rsquo;s been talkin&rsquo; 
      to ME, and when you come down here and began proposin&rsquo; the same scheme
      that I was just about headin&rsquo; up to your room with to propose to you, then&mdash;well,
      then the average whole-witted person wouldn&rsquo;t need more&rsquo;n one guess. It
      couldn&rsquo;t be Labe, &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;d been whisperin&rsquo; in MY ear, so it must have
      been the other partner in the firm. That&rsquo;s all the miracle there is to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s brain struggled with the situation. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, after a
      moment. &ldquo;She hinted that someone had been talking to you along the same
      line. Yes, and she was so sure you would agree. I might have known it was
      Laban.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm, so you might. . . . Well, there have been times when if a man had
      talked to me as Labe did to-night I&rsquo;d have knocked him down, or told him
      to go to&mdash;um&mdash;well, the tropics&mdash;told him to mind his own
      business, at least. But Labe is Labe, and besides MY conscience was
      plaguin&rsquo; me a little mite, maybe . . . maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head. &ldquo;They must have talked it over, those two,
      and agreed that one should talk to you and the other to me. By George, I
      wonder they had the nerve. It wasn&rsquo;t their business, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a darn bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet&mdash;yet I&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully glad she said it to me. I&mdash;I
      needed it, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you did, son. . . . And&mdash;humph&mdash;well, maybe I needed it,
      too. . . . Yes, I know that&rsquo;s consider&rsquo;ble for me to say,&rdquo; he added dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was still thinking of Laban and Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re queer people,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;When I first met them I thought they
      were about the funniest pair I ever saw. But&mdash;but now I can&rsquo;t help
      liking them and&mdash;and&mdash;Say, Grandfather, they must think a lot of
      your&mdash;of our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late they do, son. . . . Well, boy, we&rsquo;ve had our sermon, you and me,
      what shall we do? Willin&rsquo; to sign for the five years trial cruise if I
      will, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert couldn&rsquo;t help smiling. &ldquo;It was three years Rachel proposed, not
      five,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was, eh? Suppose we split the difference and make it four? Willin&rsquo; to try
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreement bein&rsquo; that you shall stick close to Z. Snow and Co. durin&rsquo; work
      hours and write as much poetry as you darned please other times, neither
      side to interfere with those arrangements? That right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Shall we shake hands on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook, solemnly. Captain Lote was the first to speak after
      ratification of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll go aloft and turn in,&rdquo; he observed. Then he
      added, with a little hesitation, &ldquo;Say, Al, maybe we&rsquo;d better not trouble
      your grandma about all this fool business&mdash;the row this afternoon and
      all. &lsquo;Twould only worry her and&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, looked embarrassed,
      cleared his throat, and said, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m kind of ashamed
      of my part&mdash;-er&mdash;er&mdash;that is, some of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandson was very much astonished. It was not often that Captain
      Zelotes Snow admitted having been in the wrong. He blurted out the
      question he had been dying to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;had you&mdash;did you really mean what you
      said about starting to come to my room and&mdash;and propose this scheme
      of ours&mdash;I mean of Rachel&rsquo;s and Labe&rsquo;s&mdash;to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? . . . Ye-es&mdash;yes. I was on my way up there when I met you just
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Grandfather, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, boy, that&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk any more about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t. And&mdash;and&mdash;But, Grandfather, I just want you to know
      that I guess I understand things a little better than I did, and&mdash;and
      when my father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s heavy hand descended upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave short, Al!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; consider&rsquo;ble thinkin&rsquo; 
      since Labe finished his&mdash;er&mdash;discourse and pronounced the
      benediction, and I&rsquo;ve come to a pretty definite conclusion on one matter.
      I&rsquo;ve concluded that you and I had better cut out all the bygones from this
      new arrangement of ours. We won&rsquo;t have fathers or&mdash;or&mdash;elopements&mdash;or
      past-and-done-with disapp&rsquo;intments in it. This new deal&mdash;this four
      year trial v&rsquo;yage of ours&mdash;will be just for Albert Speranza and
      Zelotes Snow, and no others need apply. . . . Eh? . . . Well, good night,
      Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the game under the &ldquo;new deal&rdquo; began. At first it was much easier than
      the old. And, as a matter of fact, it was never as hard as before. The
      heart to heart talk between Captain Zelotes and his grandson had given
      each a glimpse of the other&rsquo;s inner self, a look from the other&rsquo;s point of
      view, and thereafter it was easier to make allowances. But the necessity
      for the making of those allowances was still there and would continue to
      be there. At first Albert made almost no mistakes in his bookkeeping, was
      almost painfully careful. Then the carefulness relaxed, as it was bound to
      do, and some mistakes occurred. Captain Lote found little fault, but at
      times he could not help showing some disappointment. Then his grandson
      would set his teeth and buckle down to painstaking effort again. He was
      resolved to live up to the very letter of the agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his spare time he continued to write and occasionally he sold
      something. Whenever he did so there was great rejoicing among the feminine
      members of the Snow household; his grandmother and Rachel Ellis were
      enraptured. It was amusing to see Captain Zelotes attempt to join the
      chorus. He evidently felt that he ought to praise, or at least that praise
      was expected from him, but it was also evident that he did not approve of
      what he was praising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandma says you got rid of another one of your poetry pieces, Al,&rdquo;
       he would say. &ldquo;Pay you for it, did they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, but they will, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see. How much, think likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Ten dollars, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm . . . I see. . . . Well, that&rsquo;s pretty good, considerin&rsquo;, I
      suppose. . . . We did first-rate on that Hyannis school-house contract,
      didn&rsquo;t we. Nigh&rsquo;s I can figger it we cleared over fourteen hundred and
      eighty dollars on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He invariably followed any reference to the profit from the sale of verses
      by the casual mention of a much larger sum derived from the sale of lumber
      or hardware. This was so noticeable that Laban Keeler was impelled to
      speak of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man don&rsquo;t want you to forget that you can get more for hard pine
      than you can for soft sonnets, sellin&rsquo; &lsquo;em both by the foot,&rdquo; observed
      Labe, peering over his spectacles. &ldquo;More money in shingles than there is
      in jingles, he cal&rsquo;lates. . . . Um. . . . Yes, yes. . . . Consider&rsquo;ble
      more, consider&rsquo;ble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled, but it astonished him to find that Mr. Keeler knew what a
      sonnet was. The little bookkeeper occasionally surprised him by breaking
      out unexpectedly in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the indiscriminate praise at home, or the reluctant praise of his
      grandfather, he found relief when he discussed his verses with Helen
      Kendall. Her praise was not indiscriminate, in fact sometimes she did not
      praise at all, but expressed disapproval. They had some disagreements,
      marked disagreements, but it did not affect their friendship. Albert was a
      trifle surprised to find that it did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as the months passed he ground away at the books of Z. Snow and Company
      during office hours and at the poetry mill between times. The seeing of
      his name in print was no longer a novelty and he poetized not quite as
      steadily. Occasionally he attempted prose, but the two or three short
      stories of his composition failed to sell. Helen, however, urged him to
      try again and keep trying. &ldquo;I know you can write a good story and some day
      you are going to,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first real literary success, that which temporarily lifted him into
      the outer circle of the limelight of fame, was a poem written the day
      following that upon which came the news of the sinking of the Lusitania.
      Captain Zelotes came back from the post-office that morning, a crumpled
      newspaper in his hand, and upon his face the look which mutinous foremast
      hands had seen there just before the mutiny ended. Laban Keeler was the
      first to notice the look. &ldquo;For the land sakes, Cap&rsquo;n, what&rsquo;s gone wrong?&rdquo;
       he asked. The captain flung the paper upon the desk. &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he
      grunted. Labe slowly spread open the paper; the big black headlines
      shrieked the crime aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God Almighty!&rdquo; exclaimed the little bookkeeper. Captain Zelotes
      snorted. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The bunch
      that pulled that off was handled from the other end of the line. And I
      wish to thunder I was young enough to help send &lsquo;em back there,&rdquo; he added,
      savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Albert wrote his poem. The next day he sent it to a Boston
      paper. It was published the following morning, spread across two columns
      on the front page, and before the month was over had been copied widely
      over the country. Within the fortnight its author received his first
      request, a bona fida request for verse from a magazine. Even Captain
      Lote&rsquo;s praise of the Lusitania poem was whole-hearted and ungrudging.
    </p>
    <p>
      That summer was a busy one in South Harniss. There was the usual amount of
      summer gaiety, but in addition there were the gatherings of the various
      committees for war relief work. Helen belonged to many of these
      committees. There were dances and theatrical performances for the
      financial benefit of the various causes and here Albert shone. But he did
      not shine alone. Helen Kendall was very popular at the social gatherings,
      popular not only with the permanent residents but with the summer youth as
      well. Albert noticed this, but he did not notice it so particularly until
      Issy Price called his attention to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Al,&rdquo; observed Issy, one afternoon in late August of that year, &ldquo;how
      do YOU like that Raymond young feller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked up absently from the page of the daybook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say how do YOU like that Eddie Raymond, the Down-at-the-Neck one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at the neck? There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with his neck that I know
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said there was? He LIVES down to the Neck, don&rsquo;t he? I mean that
      young Raymond, son of the New York bank man, the ones that&rsquo;s had the
      Cahoon house all summer. How do you like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s attention was still divided between the day-book and Mr. Price.
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he answered, carelessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him
      very well. Don&rsquo;t bother me, Issy, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar chuckled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy, too,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;He, he, he! He&rsquo;s busy
      trottin&rsquo; after Helen Kendall. Don&rsquo;t seem to have time for much else these
      days. Noticed that, ain&rsquo;t you, Al? He, he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had not noticed it. His attention left the day-book altogether.
      Issachar chuckled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noticed it, ain&rsquo;t you, Al?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re the only
      one. Everybody&rsquo;s cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be cut out if you ain&rsquo;t careful. Folks
      used to figger you was Helen&rsquo;s steady comp&rsquo;ny, but it don&rsquo;t look as much
      so as it did. He, he! That&rsquo;s why I asked you how you liked the Raymond
      one. Eh? How do you, Al? Helen, SHE seems to like him fust-rate. He, he,
      he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was conscious of a peculiar feeling, partly of irritation at
      Issachar, partly something else. Mr. Price crowed delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he chortled. &ldquo;Why, Al, your face is gettin&rsquo; all redded up. Haw, haw!
      Blushin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t you, Al? Haw, haw, haw! Blushin&rsquo;, by crimustee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laid down his pen. He had learned by experience that, in Issy&rsquo;s
      case, the maxim of the best defensive being a strong offensive was
      absolutely true. He looked with concern about the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a window open somewhere, isn&rsquo;t there, Is?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      a dreadful draught anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Draught? I don&rsquo;t feel no draught. Course the window&rsquo;s open; it&rsquo;s
      generally open in summer time, ain&rsquo;t it. Haw, haw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is again! Where&mdash;Oh, <i>I</i> see! It&rsquo;s your mouth that&rsquo;s
      open, Issy. That explains the draught, of course. Yes, yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? My mouth! Never you mind my mouth. What you&rsquo;ve got to think about is
      that Eddie Raymond. Yes sir-ee! Haw, haw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Issy, what makes you make that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That awful cawing. If you&rsquo;re trying to make me believe you&rsquo;re a crow
      you&rsquo;re wasting your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, look here, Al Speranzy, be you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, I&rsquo;M not. But in your case&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll leave it to any
      fair-minded person&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on until Mr. Price stamped disgustedly out of the office. It was
      easy enough, and required nothing brilliant in the way of strategy or
      repartee, to turn Issachar&rsquo;s attack into retreat. But all the rest of that
      afternoon Albert was conscious of that peculiar feeling of uneasiness.
      After supper that night he did not go down town at once but sat in his
      room thinking deeply. The subjects of his thoughts were Edwin Raymond, the
      young chap from New York, Yale, and &ldquo;The Neck&rdquo;&mdash;and Helen Kendall. He
      succeeded only in thinking himself into an even more uneasy and unpleasant
      state of mind. Then he walked moodily down to the post-office. He was a
      little late for the mail and the laughing and chatting groups were already
      coming back after its distribution. One such group he met was made up of
      half a dozen young people on their way to the drug store for ices and
      sodas. Helen was among them and with her was young Raymond. They called to
      him to join them, but he pretended not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in all the years of their acquaintance it had not once occurred to
      Albert Speranza that his interest in Helen Kendall was anything more than
      that of a friend and comrade. He liked her, had enjoyed her society&mdash;when
      he happened to be in the mood to wish society&mdash;and it pleased him to
      feel that she was interested in his literary efforts and his career. She
      was the only girl in South Harniss who would have &ldquo;talked turkey&rdquo; to him
      as she had on the day of their adventure at High Point Light and he rather
      admired her for it. But in all his dreams of romantic attachments and
      sentimental adventure, and he had such dreams of course, she had never
      played a part. The heroines of these dreams were beautiful and mysterious
      strangers, not daughters of Cape Cod clergymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, thanks to Issy&rsquo;s mischievous hints, his feelings were in a
      puzzled and uncomfortable state. He was astonished to find that he did not
      relish the idea of Helen&rsquo;s being particularly interested in Ed Raymond.
      He, himself, had not seen her as frequently of late, she having been busy
      with her war work and he with his own interests. But that, according to
      his view, was no reason why she should permit Raymond to become friendly
      to the point of causing people to talk. He was not ready to admit that he
      himself cared, in a sentimental way, for Helen, but he resented any other
      fellow&rsquo;s daring to do so. And she should not have permitted it, either. As
      a matter of fact, Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza, hitherto reigning
      undisputed king of hearts in South Harniss, was for the first time in his
      imperial life feeling the pangs of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stalked gloomily on to the post-office. Gertie Kendrick, on the arm of
      Sam Thatcher, passed him and he did not even notice her. Gertie whispered
      to Sam that he, Albert, was a big stuck-up nothing, but she looked back
      over Sam&rsquo;s shoulder, nevertheless. Albert climbed the post-office steps
      and walked over to the rack of letter boxes. The Snow box contained little
      of interest to him, and he was turning away when he heard his name spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Speranza,&rdquo; said a feminine voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned again, to find Jane Kelsey and another young lady, a
      stranger, standing beside him. Miss Kelsey was one of South Harniss&rsquo;s
      summer residents. The Kelsey &ldquo;cottage,&rdquo; which was larger by considerable
      than the Snow house, was situated on the Bay Road, the most exclusive
      section of the village. Once, and not so many years before, the Bay Road
      was contemptuously referred to as &ldquo;Poverty Lane&rdquo; and dwellers along its
      winding, weed-grown track vied with one another in shiftless shabbiness.
      But now all shabbiness had disappeared and many-gabled &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; proudly
      stood where the shanties of the Poverty Laners once humbly leaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert had known Jane Kelsey for some time. They had met at one of the
      hotel tea-dances during his second summer in South Harniss. He and she
      were not intimate friends exactly, her mother saw to that, but they were
      well acquainted. She was short and piquant, had a nose which freckled in
      the Cape Cod sunshine, and she talked and laughed easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Speranza,&rdquo; she said, again. &ldquo;You looked so very forlorn
      I couldn&rsquo;t resist speaking. Do tell us why you are so sad; we&rsquo;re dying to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, taken by surprise, stammered that he didn&rsquo;t know that he was sad.
      Miss Kelsey laughed merrily and declared that everyone who saw him knew it
      at once. &ldquo;Oh, excuse me, Madeline,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I forgot that you and Mr.
      Speranza had not met. Of course as you&rsquo;re going to live in South Harniss
      you must know him without waiting another minute. Everybody knows
      everybody down here. He is Albert Speranza&mdash;and we sometimes call him
      Albert because here everybody calls everyone else by their first names.
      There, now you know each other and it&rsquo;s all very proper and formal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young lady who was her companion smiled. The smile was distinctly
      worth looking at, as was the young lady herself, for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Speranza knows me very well, Jane,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t know you! Why, you silly thing, haven&rsquo;t I just introduced you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about South Harniss introductions, but isn&rsquo;t it
      customary to mention names? You haven&rsquo;t told him mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Kelsey laughed in high delight. &ldquo;Oh, how perfectly ridiculous!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Albert&mdash;Mr. Speranza, I mean&mdash;this is my friend Miss
      Madeline Fosdick. She is from New York and she has decided to spend her
      summers in South Harniss&mdash;which <i>I</i> consider very good judgment.
      Her father is going to build a cottage for her to spend them in down on
      the Bay Road on the hill at the corner above the Inlet. But of course
      you&rsquo;ve heard of THAT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course he had. The purchase of the Inlet Hill land by Fletcher Fosdick,
      the New York banker, and the price paid Solomon Dadgett for that land, had
      been the principal topics of conversation around South Harniss supper
      tables for the past ten days. Captain Lote Snow had summed up local
      opinion of the transaction when he said: &ldquo;We-ll, Sol Dadgett&rsquo;s been
      talkin&rsquo; in prayer-meetin&rsquo; ever since I can remember about the comin&rsquo; of
      Paradise on earth. Judgin&rsquo; by the price he got for the Inlet Hill sand
      heap he must have cal&rsquo;lated Paradise had got here and he was sellin&rsquo; the
      golden streets by the runnin&rsquo; foot.&rdquo; Or, as Laban Keeler put it: &ldquo;They say
      King Soloman was a wise man, but I guess likely &lsquo;twas a good thing for him
      that Sol Dadgett wasn&rsquo;t alive in his time. King Sol would have needed all
      his wisdom to keep Dadgett from talkin&rsquo; him into buying the Jerusalem
      salt-ma&rsquo;sh to build the temple on. . . . Um. . . . Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Albert, as he shook hands with Miss Fosdick, regarded her with unusual
      interest. And, judging by the way in which she looked at him, she too was
      interested. After some minutes of the usual conventional summer-time chat
      the young gentleman suggested that they adjourn to the drug store for
      refreshments. The invitation was accepted, the vivacious Miss Kelsey
      acting as spokesman&mdash;or spokeswoman&mdash;in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be a mind-reader, Mr. Speranza,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I am
      dying for a sundae and I have just discovered that I haven&rsquo;t my purse or a
      penny with me. I should have been reduced to the humiliation of borrowing
      from Madeline here, or asking that deaf old Burgess man to trust me until
      to-morrow. And he is so frightfully deaf,&rdquo; she added in explanation, &ldquo;that
      when I asked him the last time he made me repeat it until I thought I
      should die of shame, or exhaustion, one or the other. Every time I shouted
      he would say &lsquo;Hey?&rsquo; and I was obliged to shout again. Of course, the place
      was crowded, and&mdash;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t like to even think about it.
      Bless you, bless you, Albert Speranza! And do please let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the drug store&mdash;it also sold, according to its
      sign, &ldquo;Cigars, soda, ice-cream, patent medicines, candy, knick-knacks,
      chewing gum, souvenirs and notions&rdquo;&mdash;the sextette of which Helen
      Kendall made one was just leaving. She nodded pleasantly to Albert and he
      nodded in return, but Ed Raymond&rsquo;s careless bow he did not choose to see.
      He had hitherto rather liked that young gentleman; now he felt a sudden
      but violent detestation for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sundaes pleasant to the palate and disastrous to all but youthful
      digestions were ordered. Albert&rsquo;s had a slight flavor of gall and
      wormwood, but he endeavored to counterbalance this by the sweetness
      derived from the society of Jane Kelsey and her friend. His conversation
      was particularly brilliant and sparkling that evening. Jane laughed much
      and chatted more. Miss Fosdick was quieter, but she, too, appeared to be
      enjoying herself. Jane demanded to know how the poems were developing. She
      begged him to have an inspiration now&mdash;&ldquo;Do, PLEASE, so that Madeline
      and I can see you.&rdquo; It seemed to be her idea that having an inspiration
      was similar to having a fit. Miss Fosdick laughed at this, but she
      declared that she adored poetry and specified certain poems which were
      objects of her especial adoration. The conversation thereafter became what
      Miss Kelsey described as &ldquo;high brow,&rdquo; and took the form of a dialogue
      between Miss Fosdick and Albert. It was interrupted by the arrival of the
      Kelsey limousine, which rolled majestically up to the drug store steps.
      Jane spied it first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy me, here&rsquo;s mother!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;And your mother, too,
      Madeline. We are tracked to our lair. . . . No, no, Mr. Speranza, you
      mustn&rsquo;t go out. No, really, we had rather you wouldn&rsquo;t. Thanks, ever so
      much, for the sundaes. Come, Madeline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Fosdick held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Speranza,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have enjoyed our poetry talk SO
      much. It must be wonderful to write as you do. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked admiringly into his eyes as she said it. In spite of the gall
      and wormwood Albert found it not at all unpleasant to be looked at in that
      way by a girl like Madeline Fosdick. His reflections on that point were
      interrupted by a voice from the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Madeline, come,&rdquo; it said, fussily. &ldquo;What ARE you waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert caught a glimpse of a majestic figure which, seated beside Mrs.
      Kelsey on the rear seat of the limousine, towered above that short, plump
      lady as a dreadnaught towers above a coal barge. He surmised this figure
      to be that of the maternal Fosdick. Madeline climbed in beside her parent
      and the limousine rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s going-to-bed reflections that evening were divided in flavor,
      like a fruit sundae, a combination of sweet and sour. The sour was
      furnished by thoughts of Edwin Raymond and Helen Kendall, the former&rsquo;s
      presumption in daring to seek her society as he did, and Helen&rsquo;s amazing
      silliness in permitting such a thing. The sweet, of course, was furnished
      by a voice which repeated to his memory the words, &ldquo;It must be wonderful
      to write as you do.&rdquo; Also the tone of that voice and the look in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could he have been privileged to hear the closing bits of a conversation
      which was taking place at that moment his reflections might have been
      still further saccharined. Miss Jane Kelsey was saying: &ldquo;And NOW what do
      you think of our Cape Cod poet? Didn&rsquo;t I promise you to show you something
      you couldn&rsquo;t find on Fifth Avenue?&rdquo; And to this Miss Madeline Fosdick made
      reply: &ldquo;I think he is the handsomest creature I ever saw. And so clever!
      Why, he is wonderful, Jane! How in the world does he happen to be living
      here&mdash;all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps, on the whole, a good thing that Albert Speranza could not
      hear this. It is certainly a good thing that Captain Zelotes Snow did not
      hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And although the balance of sweet and sour in Albert&rsquo;s mind that night was
      almost even, the sour predominated next day and continued to predominate.
      Issachar Price had sowed the seed of jealousy in the mind of the assistant
      bookkeeper of Z. Snow and Company, and that seed took root and grew as it
      is only too likely to do under such circumstances. That evening Albert
      walked again to the post-office. Helen was not there, neither was Miss
      Kelsey or Miss Fosdick. He waited for a time and then determined to call
      at the Kendall home, something he had not done for some time. As he came
      up to the front walk, between the arbor-vitae hedges, he saw that the
      parlor windows were alight. The window shade was but partially drawn and
      beneath it he could see into the room. Helen was seated at the piano and
      Edwin Raymond was standing beside her, ready to turn the page of her
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert whirled on his heel and walked out of the yard and down the street
      toward his own home. His attitude of mind was a curious one. He had a mind
      to wait until Raymond left and then go into the Kendall parlor and demand
      of Helen to know what she meant by letting that fellow make such a fool of
      himself. What right had he&mdash;Raymond&mdash;to call upon her, and turn
      her music and&mdash;and set the whole town talking? Why&mdash;Oh, he could
      think of many things to ask and say. The trouble was that the saying of
      them would, he felt sure, be distinctly bad diplomacy on his part. No one&mdash;not
      even he&mdash;could talk to Helen Kendall in that fashion; not unless he
      wished it to be their final conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went home, to fret and toss angrily and miserably half the night. He
      had never before considered himself in the slightest degree in love with
      Helen, but he had taken for granted the thought that she liked him better
      than anyone else. Now he was beginning to fear that perhaps she did not,
      and, with his temperament, wounded vanity and poetic imagination supplied
      the rest. Within a fortnight he considered himself desperately in love
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this fortnight he called at the parsonage, the Kendall home,
      several times. On the first of these occasions the Reverend Mr. Kendall,
      having just completed a sermon dealing with the war and, being full of his
      subject, read the said sermon to his daughter and to Albert. The reading
      itself lasted for three-quarters of an hour and Mr. Kendall&rsquo;s
      post-argument and general dissertation on German perfidy another hour
      after that. By that time it was late and Albert went home. The second call
      was even worse, for Ed Raymond called also and the two young men glowered
      at each other until ten o&rsquo;clock. They might have continued to glower
      indefinitely, for neither meant to leave before the other, but Helen
      announced that she had some home-study papers to look over and she knew
      they would excuse her under the circumstances. On that hint they departed
      simultaneously, separating at the gate and walking with deliberate dignity
      in opposite directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his third attempt, however, Albert was successful to the extent that
      Helen was alone when he called and there was no school work to interrupt.
      But in no other respect was the interview satisfactory. All that week he
      had been boiling with the indignation of the landed proprietor who
      discovers a trespasser on his estate, and before this call was fifteen
      minutes old his feelings had boiled over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS the matter with you, Al?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;Do tell me and let&rsquo;s see
      if I can&rsquo;t help you out of your trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her visitor flushed. &ldquo;Trouble?&rdquo; he repeated, stiffly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, do. You must. What IS the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing the matter with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Of course there is. You have scarcely spoken a word of your own
      accord since you came, and you have been scowling like a thundercloud all
      the time. Now what is it? Have I done something you don&rsquo;t like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing the matter, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be so silly. Of course there is. I thought there must be
      something wrong the last time you were here, that evening, when Ed called,
      too. It seemed to me that you were rather queer then. Now you are queerer
      still. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This straightforward attack, although absolutely characteristic of Helen,
      was disconcerting. Albert met it by an attack of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what does that Raymond fellow mean by coming to see
      you as he does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now whether or not Helen was entirely in the dark as to the cause of her
      visitor&rsquo;s &ldquo;queerness&rdquo; is a question not to be answered here. She was far
      from being a stupid young person and it is at least probable that she may
      have guessed a little of the truth. But, being feminine, she did not
      permit Albert to guess that she had guessed. If her astonishment at the
      question was not entirely sincere, it certainly appeared to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What does he mean by coming to see me?
      Why, what do YOU mean? I should think that was the question. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he come to see me, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Albert has a dozen reasons in his mind, each of which was to him
      sufficiently convincing. But expressing those reasons to Helen Kendall he
      found singularly difficult. He grew confused and stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, because he has no business to come here so much,&rdquo; was
      the best he could do. Helen, strange to say, was not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has no business to?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why, of course he has. I asked him to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? Good heavens, you don&rsquo;t LIKE him, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I like him. I think he is a very nice fellow. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, because I don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all. He has no business to
      monopolize you all the time. Why, he is here about every night in the
      week, or you&rsquo;re out with him, down town, or&mdash;or somewhere. Everybody
      is talking about it and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, please. You say everybody is talking about Ed Raymond and
      me. What do you mean by that? What are they saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying. . . . Oh, they&rsquo;re saying you and he are&mdash;are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are&mdash;are&mdash;Oh, they&rsquo;re saying all sorts of things. Look here,
      Helen, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! I want to know more about this. What have you heard said about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a lot of things. . . . That is&mdash;er&mdash;well, nothing in
      particular, perhaps, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Who have you heard saying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind! Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do mind. Who have you heard saying this &lsquo;lot of things&rsquo; about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody, I tell you. . . . Oh, well, if you must know, Issy Price said&mdash;well,
      he said you and this Raymond fellow were what he called &lsquo;keeping company&rsquo; 
      and&mdash;and that the whole town was talking about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Issy Price!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And you listened to what Issy Price said.
      Issy Price, of all people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, he said everyone else said the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say more than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but that was enough, wasn&rsquo;t it. Besides, the rest was plain. I could
      see it myself. He is calling here about every night in the week, and&mdash;and
      being around everywhere with you and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, anyone can see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen&rsquo;s usually placid temper was beginning to ruffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;then they may see. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he call here if
      he wishes&mdash;and I wish? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be &lsquo;around with him,&rsquo; as you
      say? Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because I don&rsquo;t like it. It isn&rsquo;t the right thing for you to do.
      You ought to be more careful of&mdash;of what people say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He realized, almost as soon as this last sentence was blurted out, the
      absolute tactlessness of it. The quiet gleam of humor he had so often
      noticed in Helen&rsquo;s eyes was succeeded now by a look he had never before
      seen there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he added, hastily. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Helen. I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to say that. Forgive me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer immediately. Then she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I
      shall or not. I think I shall have to think it over. And perhaps you had
      better go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;M sorry, Helen. It was a fool thing to say. I don&rsquo;t know why I was
      such an idiot. Do forgive me; come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And this you
      must understand: If Ed Raymond, or anyone else, calls on me and I choose
      to permit it, or if I choose to go out with him anywhere at any time, that
      is my affair and not &lsquo;everyone else&rsquo;s&rsquo;&mdash;which includes Issachar
      Price. And my FRIENDS&mdash;my real friends&mdash;will not listen to mean,
      ridiculous gossip. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was the end of that attempt at asserting the Divine Right by the
      South Harniss king of hearts. Albert was more miserable than ever, angrier
      than ever&mdash;not only at Raymond and Helen, but at himself&mdash;and
      his newly-discovered jealousy burned with a brighter and greener flame.
      The idea of throwing everything overboard, going to Canada and enlisting
      in the Canadian Army&mdash;an idea which had had a strong and alluring
      appeal ever since the war broke out&mdash;came back with redoubled force.
      But there was the agreement with his grandfather. He had given his word;
      how could he break it? Besides, to go away and leave his rival with a
      clear field did not appeal to him, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Wednesday evening in the middle of September the final social event
      of the South Harniss summer season was to take place. The Society for the
      Relief of the French Wounded was to give a dance in the ballroom of the
      hotel, the proceeds from the sale of tickets to be devoted to the purpose
      defined by the name of this organization. Every last member of the summer
      colony was to attend, of course, and all those of the permanent residents
      who aspired to social distinction and cared to pay the high price of
      admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was going, naturally. That is, he had at first planned to go, then&mdash;after
      the disastrous call at the parsonage&mdash;decided that he would go under
      no circumstances, and at the last changed his mind once more to the
      affirmative. Miss Madeline Fosdick, Jane Kelsey&rsquo;s friend, was responsible
      for the final change. She it was who had sold him his ticket and urged him
      to be present. He and she had met several times since the first meeting at
      the post-office. Usually when they met they talked concerning poetry and
      kindred lofty topics. Albert liked Miss Fosdick. It is hard not to like a
      pretty, attractive young lady who takes such a flattering interest in
      one&rsquo;s aspirations and literary efforts. The &ldquo;high brow chit-chats&rdquo;&mdash;quoting
      Miss Kelsey again&mdash;were pleasant in many ways; for instance, they
      were in the nature of a tonic for weakened self-esteem, and the Speranza
      self-esteem was suffering just at this time, from shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert had, when he first heard that the dance was to take place, intended
      inviting Helen to accompany him. He had taken her acceptance for granted,
      he having acted as her escort to so many dances and social affairs. So he
      neglected inviting her and then came Issy&rsquo;s mischief-making remarks and
      the trouble which followed. So, as inviting her was out of the question,
      he resolved not to attend, himself. But Miss Fosdick urged so prettily
      that he bought his ticket and promised to be among those present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Provided, of course,&rdquo; he ventured, being in a reckless mood, &ldquo;that you
      save me at least four dances.&rdquo; She raised her brows in mock dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I couldn&rsquo;t do that. Four is
      much too many. One I will promise, but no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, as he persisted, she yielded another. He was to have two dances
      and, possibly an &ldquo;extra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are a lucky young man,&rdquo; declared Jane Kelsey, who had also
      promised two. &ldquo;If you knew how many fellows have begged for just one. But,
      of course,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;THEY were not poets, second editions of Tennyson
      and Keats and all that. It is Keats who was the poet, isn&rsquo;t it, Madeline?&rdquo;
       she added, turning to her friend. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad I got it right the
      first time. I&rsquo;m always mixing him up with Watts, the man who invented the
      hymns and wrote the steam-engine&mdash;or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wednesday evening in the middle of September was a beautiful one and
      the hotel was crowded. The Item, in its account the following week,
      enumerating those present, spoke of &ldquo;Our new residents, Mrs. Fletcher
      Story Fosdick and Miss Madeline Fosdick, who are to occupy the magnificent
      residence now about being built on the Inlet Hill by their husband and
      father, respectively, Fletcher Story Fosdick, Esquire, the well-known New
      York banker.&rdquo; The phrasing of this news note caused much joy in South
      Harniss, and the Item gained several new and hopeful subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the gushing reporter responsible for this added that &ldquo;Miss
      Fosdick was a dream of loveliness on this occasion&rdquo; he was stating only
      the truth. She was very beautiful indeed and a certain young man who
      stepped up to claim his first dance realized the fact. The said young man
      was outwardly cool, but red-hot within, the internal rise in temperature
      being caused by the sight of Helen Kendall crossing the floor arm in arm
      with Edwin Raymond. Albert&rsquo;s face was white with anger, except for two red
      spots on his cheeks, and his black eyes flashed. Consequently he, too, was
      considered quite worth the looking at and feminine glances followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that handsome, foreign-looking fellow your friend is dancing
      with?&rdquo; whispered one young lady, a guest at the hotel, to Miss Kelsey.
      Jane told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t a foreigner,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;He lives here in South Harniss all
      the year. He is a poet, I believe, and Madeline, who knows about such
      things&mdash;inherits it from her mother, I suppose&mdash;says his poetry
      is beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion watched the subject of their conversation as, with Miss
      Fosdick, he moved lightly and surely through the crowd on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He LOOKS like a poet,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;He is wonderfully handsome, so
      distinguished, and SUCH a dancer! But why should a poet live here&mdash;all
      the year? Is that all he does for a living&mdash;write poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane pretended not to hear her and, a masculine friend coming to claim his
      dance, seized the opportunity to escape. However, another &ldquo;sitter out&rdquo;
       supplied the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a sort of assistant bookkeeper at the lumber yard by the railroad
      station,&rdquo; said this person. &ldquo;His grandfather owns the place, I believe.
      One would never guess it to look at him now. . . . Humph! I wonder if Mrs.
      Fosdick knows. They say she is&mdash;well, not democratically inclined, to
      say the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert had his two promised dances with Madeline Fosdick, but the &ldquo;extra&rdquo;
       he did not obtain. Mrs. Fosdick, the ever watchful, had seen and made
      inquiries. Then she called her daughter to her and issued an ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am SO sorry,&rdquo; said the young lady, in refusing the plea for the
      &ldquo;extra.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should like to, but I&mdash;but Mother has asked me to dance
      with a friend of ours from home. I&mdash;I AM sorry, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked as if she meant it. Albert was sorry, too. This had been a
      strange evening, another combination of sweet and sour. He glanced across
      the floor and saw Helen and the inevitable Raymond emerge together from
      the room where the refreshments were served. Raging jealousy seized him at
      the sight. Helen had not been near him, had scarcely spoken to him since
      his arrival. He forgot that he had not been near nor spoken to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He danced twice or thrice more with acquaintances, &ldquo;summer&rdquo; or permanent,
      and then decided to go home. Madeline Fosdick he saw at the other end of
      the room surrounded by a group of young masculinity. Helen he could not
      see at the moment. He moved in the direction of the coatroom. Just as he
      reached the door he was surprised to see Ed Raymond stride by him, head
      down and looking anything but joyful. He watched and was still more
      astonished to see the young man get his coat and hat from the attendant
      and walk out of the hotel. He saw him stride away along the drive and down
      the moonlit road. He was, apparently, going home&mdash;going home alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got his own coat and hat and, before putting them on, stepped back for
      a final look at the ballroom. As he stood by the cloakroom door someone
      touched his arm. Turning he saw Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, Helen!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going home?&rdquo; she asked, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind&mdash;would it trouble you too much to walk with me as far
      as our house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why of course not. I shall be delighted. But I thought you&mdash;I
      thought Ed Raymond&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m alone. Wait here; I will be ready in just a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away. He gazed after her in bewilderment. She and he had
      scarcely exchanged a word during the evening, and now, when the evening
      was almost over, she came and asked him to be her escort. What in the wide
      world&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      The minute she had specified had hardly elapsed when she reappeared, ready
      for out of doors. She took his arm and they walked down the steps of the
      hotel, past the group of lights at the head of the drive and along the
      road, with the moon shining down upon it and the damp, salt breeze from
      the ocean blowing across it. They walked for the first few minutes in
      silence. There were a dozen questions he would have liked to ask, but his
      jealous resentment had not entirely vanished and his pride forbade. It was
      she who spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must think this very odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew what she meant, but he did not choose to admit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my asking you to walk home with me, after&mdash;after our trouble.
      It is strange, I suppose, particularly as you had not spoken before this
      whole evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>&mdash;spoken to YOU? Why, you bowed to me when I came into the
      room and that was the only sign of recognition you gave me until just now.
      Not a dance&mdash;not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect me to look you up and beg you to dance with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you expect me to trot at that fellow&rsquo;s heels and wait my chance to
      get a word with you, to take what he left? I should say not! By George,
      Helen, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;This is all so silly, so
      childish. And we mustn&rsquo;t quarrel any more. I have made up my mind to that.
      We mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! All right, <i>I</i> had no thought of quarreling in the beginning.
      But there are some things a self-respecting chap can&rsquo;t stand. I have SOME
      pride, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath quickly. &ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that it was no
      sacrifice to my pride to beg you to walk home with me? After&mdash;after
      the things you said the other evening? Oh, Albert, how could you say
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated, and then added, &ldquo;I told you I was sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you weren&rsquo;t really sorry. You must have believed the things that
      hateful Issachar Price said or you wouldn&rsquo;t have repeated them. . . . Oh,
      but never mind that now, I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak of it at all. I asked you
      to walk home with me because I wanted to make up our quarrel. Yes, that
      was it. I didn&rsquo;t want to go away and feel that you and I were not as good
      friends as ever. So, you see, I put all MY pride to one side&mdash;and
      asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One phrase in one sentence of this speech caught and held the young man&rsquo;s
      attention. He forgot the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What do you mean? Where are you
      going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Cambridge to study. I am going to take some courses at
      Radcliffe. You know I told you I hoped to some day. Well, it has been
      arranged. I am to live with my cousin, father&rsquo;s half sister in Somerville.
      Father is well enough to leave now and I have engaged a capable woman,
      Mrs. Peters, to help Maria with the housework. I am going Friday morning,
      the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short to stare at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; he asked, again. &ldquo;You are going to do that and&mdash;and&mdash;Why
      didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a characteristic return to his attitude of outraged royalty. She
      had made all these plans, had arranged to do this thing, and he had not
      been informed. At another time Helen might have laughed at him; she
      generally did when he became what she called the &ldquo;Grand Bashaw.&rdquo; She did
      not laugh now, however, but answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was going to do it until a little more than a week ago,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;And I have not seen you since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve been too busy seeing someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lost patience for the instant. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;I know who you mean, of course. You mean Ed Raymond. Don&rsquo;t you know why
      he has been at the house so much of late? Why he and I have been so much
      together? Don&rsquo;t you really know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? . . . No, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;except that you and he wanted to be
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t occur to you that there might be some other reason? You
      forgot, I suppose, that he and I were appointed on the Ticket Committee
      for this very dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten it entirely. Now he remembered perfectly the meeting of
      the French Relief Society at which the appointment had been made. In fact
      Helen herself had told him of it at the time. For the moment he was
      staggered, but he rallied promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Committee meetings may do as an excuse for some things,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      they don&rsquo;t explain the rest&mdash;his calls here every other evening and&mdash;and
      so on. Honest now, Helen, you know he hasn&rsquo;t been running after you in
      this way just because he is on that committee with you; now don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were almost at the parsonage. The light from Mr. Kendall&rsquo;s study
      window shone through the leaves of the lilac bush behind the white fence.
      Helen started to speak, but hesitated. He repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why, yes, I suppose I do,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;I do know&mdash;now.
      But I didn&rsquo;t even think of such a thing until&mdash;until you came that
      evening and told me what Issy Price said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you didn&rsquo;t guess at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, perhaps I&mdash;I thought he liked to come&mdash;liked
      to&mdash;Oh, what is the use of being silly! I did think he liked to call,
      but only as a friend. He was jolly and lots of fun and we were both fond
      of music. I enjoyed his company. I never dreamed that there was anything
      more than that until you came and were so&mdash;disagreeable. And even
      then I didn&rsquo;t believe&mdash;until to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she hesitated. &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What happened to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing. I can&rsquo;t tell you. Oh, why can&rsquo;t friends be friends and not. .
      . . That is why I spoke to you, Albert, why I wanted to have this talk
      with you. I was going away so soon and I couldn&rsquo;t bear to go with any
      unfriendliness between us. There mustn&rsquo;t be. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard but a part of this. The memory of Raymond&rsquo;s face as he had seen
      it when the young man strode out of the cloakroom and out of the hotel
      came back to him and with it a great heart-throbbing sense of relief, of
      triumph. He seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;did he&mdash;did you tell him&mdash;Oh, by George,
      Helen, you&rsquo;re the most wonderful girl in the world! I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&mdash;Oh,
      Helen, you know I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not his habit to be at a loss for words, but he was just then. He
      tried to retain her hand, to put his arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful! You&rsquo;re splendid! I&rsquo;m crazy about
      you! I really am! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed him gently away. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must. Don&rsquo;t you see I. . . . Why, you&rsquo;re crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face had, for a moment, been upturned. The moon at that moment had
      slipped behind a cloud, but the lamplight from the window had shown him
      the tears in her eyes. He was amazed. He could have shouted, have laughed
      aloud from joy or triumphant exultation just then, but to weep! What
      occasion was there for tears, except on Ed Raymond&rsquo;s part?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crying!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why, Helen&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said, again. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Please don&rsquo;t talk that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want me to, Helen? I&mdash;I want you to know how I feel.
      You don&rsquo;t understand. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! . . . Don&rsquo;t, Al, don&rsquo;t, please. Don&rsquo;t talk in that way. I don&rsquo;t
      want you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it is foolish. You&rsquo;re only a boy, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boy! I&rsquo;m more than a year older than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? Why yes, I suppose you are, really. But that doesn&rsquo;t make any
      difference. I guess girls are older than boys when they are our age, lots
      older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother all that! We aren&rsquo;t kids, either of us. I want you to listen.
      You don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. But I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t. You are glad because you have found
      you have no reason to be jealous of Ed Raymond and that makes you say&mdash;foolish
      things. But I&rsquo;m not going to have our friendship spoiled in that way. I
      want us to be real friends, always. So you mustn&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not silly. Helen, if you won&rsquo;t listen to anything else, will you
      listen to this? Will you promise me that while you are away you won&rsquo;t have
      other fellows calling on you or&mdash;or anything like that? And I&rsquo;ll
      promise you that I&rsquo;ll have nothing to say to another girl&mdash;in any way
      that counts, I mean. Shall we promise each other that, Helen? Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused for some moment before answering, but her reply, when it came,
      was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should promise anything, except to
      remain friends. You might promise and then be sorry, later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> might? How about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we both might. So we won&rsquo;t take the risk. You may come and see me
      to-morrow evening and say good-by, if you like. But you mustn&rsquo;t stay long.
      It is my last night with father for some time and I mustn&rsquo;t cheat him out
      of it. Good night, Albert. I&rsquo;m so glad our misunderstanding is over,
      aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am. But, Helen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go in now. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reflections of Alberto Speranza during his walk back to the Snow place
      were varied but wonderful. He thought of Raymond&rsquo;s humiliation and gloried
      in it. He thought of Helen and rhapsodized. And if, occasionally, he
      thought also of the dance and of Madeline Fosdick, forgive him. He was
      barely twenty-one and the moon was shining.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The good-by call the following evening was, to him at least, not very
      satisfactory. Helen was tired, having been busy all day with the final
      preparations for leaving, and old Mr. Kendall insisted on being present
      during the entire visit and in telling long and involved stories of the
      trip abroad he had made when a young man and the unfavorable opinion which
      he had then formed of Prussians as traveling companions. Albert&rsquo;s opinion
      of Prussians was at least as unfavorable as his own, but his complete and
      even eager agreement with each of the old gentleman&rsquo;s statements did not
      have the effect of choking the latter off, but rather seemed to act as
      encouragement for more. When ten o&rsquo;clock came and it was time to go Albert
      felt as if he had been listening to a lecture on the Hohenzollerns. &ldquo;Great
      Scott, Helen,&rdquo; he whispered, as she came to the door with him, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      feel as if I had talked with you a minute. Why, I scarcely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But just here Mr. Kendall came hurrying from the sitting-room to tell of
      one incident which he had hitherto forgotten, and so even this brief
      interval of privacy was denied. But Albert made one more attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to run over to the station to-morrow morning to see you off,&rdquo;
       he called from the gate. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The morning train left at nine o&rsquo;clock, and at a quarter to nine Albert,
      who had kept his eye on the clock ever since eight, his hour of arriving
      at the office, called to Mr. Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone and one as casual as he could assume, &ldquo;I
      am going to run out for a few minutes. I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar&rsquo;s response was as usual anything but low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; out? Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just going out&mdash;er&mdash;on an errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of an errand? I was cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to run out myself for a little
      spell. Can&rsquo;t I do your errand for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. . . There, there, don&rsquo;t bother me any more. I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry! So&rsquo;m I in a hurry. I was cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to run acrost to the deepo and
      see Helen Kendall start for Boston. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; this morning; did you know
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the somewhat flustered assistant bookkeeper could reply Captain
      Zelotes called from the inner office:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if that was where Al was bound, too,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;And I
      was thinkin&rsquo; of the same thing. Suppose we all go together. Labe&rsquo;ll keep
      shop, won&rsquo;t you, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler looked over his spectacles. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes .
      . . yes, yes, yes. And say good-by to Helen for me, some of you, if you
      happen to think of it. Not that &lsquo;twill make much difference to her,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;whether she gets my good-bys or not, but it might make some to me.
      . . . Um, yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price was eager to oblige.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her you sent &lsquo;em, Labe,&rdquo; he said, patronizingly. &ldquo;Set your mind
      to rest; I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban&rsquo;s lip twitched. &ldquo;Much obliged, Is,&rdquo; he chirruped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great
      relief! My mind&rsquo;s rested some already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, instead of going alone to the railway station, Albert made one of a
      delegation of three. And at the station was Mr. Kendall, and two of the
      school committee, and one or two members of the church sewing circle, and
      the president and secretary of the Society for the Relief of the French
      Wounded. So far from being an intimate confidential farewell, Helen&rsquo;s
      departure was in the nature of a public ceremony with speech-making. Mr.
      Price made most of the speeches, in fact the lower portion of his
      countenance was in violent motion most of the ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care of yourself, Helen,&rdquo; he urged loudly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about
      your pa, we&rsquo;ll look out for him. And don&rsquo;t let none of them Boston fellers
      carry you off. We&rsquo;ll watch and see that Eddie Raymond and Al here don&rsquo;t
      get into mischief while you&rsquo;re gone. I . . . Crimustee! Jim Young, what in
      time&rsquo;s the matter with you? Can&rsquo;t ye see nothin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last outburst was directed at the driver of the depot-wagon, who,
      wheeling a trunk on a baggage truck, had bumped violently into the rear of
      Mr. Price&rsquo;s legs, just at the knee joint, causing their owner to bend
      backward unexpectedly, and with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see nothin&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s right in front of ye?&rdquo; demanded Issachar,
      righteously indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Young winked over his shoulder at Albert. &ldquo;Sorry, Is,&rdquo; he said, as he
      continued toward the baggage car. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice you WAS in front of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you&rsquo;d better. . . . Eh? See here, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even after Mr. Price had thus been pushed out of the foreground, so to
      speak, Albert was denied the opportunity of taking his place by Helen&rsquo;s
      side. Her father had a few last messages to deliver, then Captain Zelotes
      shook her hand and talked for a moment, and, after that, the ladies of the
      sewing circle and the war work society felt it their duty to, severally
      and jointly, kiss her good-by. This last was a trying operation to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the engine bell rang and the train began to move. Albert, running
      beside the platform of the last car, held up his hand for a farewell
      clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said, and added in a whisper, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll write, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. And so must you. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last car and the handkerchief waving figure on its platform
      disappeared around the curve. The little group by the station broke up.
      Albert and his grandfather walked over to the office together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes a good girl, Al,&rdquo; was Captain Lote&rsquo;s only comment. &ldquo;A mighty
      good capable girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded. A moment later he lifted his hat to a group in a passing
      automobile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were those folks?&rdquo; asked the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fosdicks,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;The people who are going to build down by
      the Inlet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Madeline and her mother. The latter had been serenely indifferent,
      but the young lady had smiled and bowed behind the maternal shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh; that so?&rdquo; observed Captain Zelotes, looking after the flying car with
      interest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s who &lsquo;tis, eh? Nice lookin&rsquo;, the young one, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not answer. With the noise of the train which was carrying
      Helen out of his life still ringing in his ears it seemed wicked even to
      mention another girl&rsquo;s name, to say nothing of commenting upon her good
      looks. For the rest of that day he was a gloomy spirit, a dark shadow in
      the office of Z. Snow and Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of another fortnight the season at South Harniss was
      definitely over. The hotel closed on the Saturday following the dance, and
      by October first the last of the cottages was locked and shuttered. The
      Kelseys went on the twentieth and the Fosdicks went with them. Albert met
      Madeline and Jane at the post-office in the evening of the nineteenth and
      there more farewells were said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us down here in the sand, will you?&rdquo; he suggested to Miss
      Fosdick. It was Jane Kelsey who answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she won&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; returned that young lady. &ldquo;Why she has your
      photograph to remember you by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madeline colored becomingly and was, as Jane described it, &ldquo;awfully
      fussed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with much indignation, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any such
      thing. You know I haven&rsquo;t, Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have, my dear. You have a photograph of him standing in front of
      the drug store and looking dreamily in at&mdash;at the strawberry sundaes.
      It is a most romantic pose, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. He remembered the photograph. It was one of a series of
      snapshots taken with Miss Kelsey&rsquo;s camera one Saturday afternoon when a
      party of young people had met in front of the sundae dispensary. Jane had
      insisted on &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me that I have never seen the rest of those photographs,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Well, you ought to see them. I have
      Madeline&rsquo;s with me. It is a dream, if I do say it as I took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She produced the snapshot, which showed her friend standing beside the
      silver-leaf tree before the druggist&rsquo;s window and smiling at the camera.
      It was a good likeness and, consequently, a very pretty picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a dream, just as I said?&rdquo; demanded the artist. &ldquo;Honest now,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert of course declared it to be beyond praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have this one?&rdquo; he asked, on the impulse of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, stupid,&rdquo; commanded Jane, mischievously. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t my
      funeral&mdash;or my portrait, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he repeated, turning to Madeline. She hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why yes, you may, if you care for it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
      particular one is Jane&rsquo;s, anyway, and if she chooses to give it away I
      don&rsquo;t see how I can prevent her. But why you should want the old thing I
      can&rsquo;t conceive. I look as stiff and wooden as a sign-post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane held up a protesting finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fibs, fibs, fibs,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t conceive why he should want it!
      As if you weren&rsquo;t perfectly aware that he will wear it next his heart and&mdash;Oh,
      don&rsquo;t put it in THAT pocket! I said next your heart, and that isn&rsquo;t on
      your RIGHT side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert took the photograph home and stuck it between the frame and glass
      of his bureau. Then came a sudden remembrance of his parting with Helen
      and with it a twinge of conscience. He had begged her to have nothing to
      do with any other fellow. True she had refused to promise and consequently
      he also was unbound, but that made no difference&mdash;should not make
      any. So he put the photograph at the back of the drawer where he kept his
      collars and ties, with a resolve never to look at it. He did not look at
      it&mdash;very often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came another long winter. He ground away at the bookkeeping&mdash;he
      was more proficient at it, but he hated it as heartily as ever&mdash;and
      wrote a good deal of verse and some prose. For the first time he sold a
      prose article, a short story, to a minor magazine. He wrote long letters
      to Helen and she replied. She was studying hard, she liked her work, and
      she had been offered the opportunity to tutor in a girls&rsquo; summer camp in
      Vermont during July and August and meant to accept provided her father&rsquo;s
      health continued good. Albert protested violently against her being absent
      from South Harniss for so long. &ldquo;You will scarcely be home at all,&rdquo; he
      wrote. &ldquo;I shall hardly see you. What am I going to do? As it is now I miss
      you&mdash;&rdquo; and so on for four closely written pages. Having gotten into
      the spirit of composition he, so to speak, gloried in his loneliness, so
      much so that Helen was moved to remonstrate. &ldquo;Your letter made me almost
      miserable,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;until I had read it over twice. Then I began to
      suspect that you were enjoying your wretchedness, or enjoying writing
      about it. I truly don&rsquo;t believe anyone&mdash;you especially&mdash;could be
      quite as lonesome as all that. Honestly now, Albert, weren&rsquo;t you
      exaggerating a little? I rather think you were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been, of course, but it irritated him to think that she recognized
      the fact. She had an uncanny faculty of seeing through his every pretense.
      In his next letter he said nothing whatever about being lonesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      At home, and at the office, the war was what people talked about most of
      the time. Since the Lusitania&rsquo;s sinking Captain Zelotes had been a battle
      charger chafing at the bit. He wanted to fight and to fight at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it, Mother,&rdquo; he declared, over and over again. &ldquo;Sooner or
      later we&rsquo;ve got to fight that Kaiser gang. What are we waitin&rsquo; for; will
      somebody tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive, as usual, was mild and unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably the President knows as much about it as you and me, Zelotes,&rdquo;
       she suggested. &ldquo;I presume likely he has his own reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! When Seth Bassett got up in the night and took a drink out of the
      bottle of Paris Green by mistake &lsquo;Bial Cahoon asked him what in time he
      kept Paris Green in his bedroom for, anyhow. All that Seth would say was
      that he had his own reasons. The rest of the town was left to guess what
      those reasons was. That&rsquo;s what the President&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;&mdash;keepin&rsquo; us
      guessin&rsquo;. By the everlastin&rsquo;, if I was younger I&rsquo;d ship aboard a British
      lime-juicer and go and fight, myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Rachel Ellis who caused the Captain to be a bit more restrained in
      his remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t ought to talk that way, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not when
      Albert&rsquo;s around, you hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the first thing you know he&rsquo;ll be startin&rsquo; for Canada to enlist.
      He&rsquo;s been crazy to do it for &lsquo;most a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has? How do you know he has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s told me so, more&rsquo;n once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her employer looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;He seems to tell you a good many things he doesn&rsquo;t
      tell the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he
      did.&rdquo; A moment later she added, &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Lote, you will be careful, won&rsquo;t
      you? You wouldn&rsquo;t want Al to go off and leave Z. Snow and Company when him
      and you are gettin&rsquo; on so much better. You ARE gettin&rsquo; on better, ain&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain pulled at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;seems as if we was. He ain&rsquo;t any wonder at
      bookkeepin&rsquo;, but he&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n he used to be; and he does seem to try
      hard, I&rsquo;ll say that for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachael beamed gratification. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a Robert Penfold yet,&rdquo; she
      declared; &ldquo;see if he isn&rsquo;t. So you musn&rsquo;t encourage him into enlistin&rsquo; in
      the Canadian army. You wouldn&rsquo;t want him to do that any more&rsquo;n the rest of
      us would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain gazed intently into the bowl of the pipe which he had been
      cleaning. He made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want him to do that, would you?&rdquo; repeated the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote blew through the pipe stem. Then he said, &ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t . .
      . but I&rsquo;m darn glad he&rsquo;s got the spunk to WANT to do it. We may get that
      Portygee streak out of him, poetry and all, give us time; eh, Rachael?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time in months that he had used the word &ldquo;Portygee&rdquo; in
      connection with his grandson. Mrs. Ellis smiled to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In April the arbutus buds began to appear above the leaf mold between the
      scrub oaks in the woods, and the walls of Fletcher Fosdick&rsquo;s new summer
      home began to rise above the young pines on the hill by the Inlet in the
      Bay Road. The Item kept its readers informed, by weekly installments, of
      the progress made by the builders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lumber for Mr. Fletcher Fosdick&rsquo;s new cottage is beginning to be
      hauled to his property on Inlet Hill in this town. Our enterprising firm
      of South Harniss dealers, Z. Snow &amp; Co., are furnishing said lumber.
      Mr. Nehemiah Nickerson is to do the mason work. Mr. Fosdick shows good
      judgment as well as a commendable spirit in engaging local talent in this
      way. We venture to say he will never regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fosdick&rsquo;s new residence is beginning building, the foundation
      being pretty near laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the following week:
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fosdick mansion is growing fast. South Harniss may well be proud of
      its new ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise in three successive numbers from &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; to &ldquo;mansion&rdquo; is
      perhaps sufficient to indicate that the Fosdick summer home was to be, as
      Issachar Price described it, &ldquo;Some considerable house! Yes sir, by crimus,
      some considerable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In June, Helen came home for a week. At the end of the week she left to
      take up her new duties at the summer camp for girls in Vermont. Albert and
      she were together a good deal during that week. Anticipating her arrival,
      the young man&rsquo;s ardent imagination had again fanned what he delighted to
      think of as his love for her into flame. During the last months of the
      winter he had not played the languishing swain as conscientiously as
      during the autumn. Like the sailor in the song &ldquo;is &lsquo;eart was true to Poll&rdquo;
       always, but he had broken away from his self-imposed hermitage in his room
      at the Snow place several times to attend sociables, entertainments and,
      even, dances. Now, when she returned he was eagerly awaiting her and would
      have haunted the parsonage before and after working hours of every day as
      well as the evening, if she had permitted, and when with her assumed a
      proprietary air which was so obvious that even Mr. Price felt called upon
      to comment on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Al,&rdquo; drawled Issachar, &ldquo;cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ve cut out Eddie Raymond along
      with Helen, ain&rsquo;t ye? Don&rsquo;t see him hangin&rsquo; around any since she got back,
      and the way you was actin&rsquo; when I see you struttin&rsquo; into the parsonage
      yard last night afore mail time made me think you must have a first
      mortgage on Helen and her pa and the house and the meetin&rsquo;-house and
      two-thirds of the graveyard. I never see such an important-lookin&rsquo; critter
      in MY life. Haw, haw! Eh? How &lsquo;bout it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not mind the Price sarcasm; instead he felt rather grateful to
      have the proletariat recognize that he had triumphed again. The fly in his
      ointment, so to speak, was the fact that Helen herself did not in the
      least recognize that triumph. She laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, please, please, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; with a repetition of the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly! Well, I like that! Aren&rsquo;t you and I engaged? Or just the same as
      engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course we are not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we promised each other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we did not. And you know we didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, why do you treat me that way? Don&rsquo;t you know that&mdash;that I
      just worship the ground you tread on? Don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;re the only girl
      in this world I could ever care for? Don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking home from church Sunday morning and had reached the
      corner below the parsonage. There, screened by the thicket of young
      silver-leafs, she stopped momentarily and looked into his face. Then she
      walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know how much I care?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;You think you do now, perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you
      will change your mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that? How do you know I will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know you. There, there, Albert, we won&rsquo;t quarrel, will we? And
      we won&rsquo;t be silly. You&rsquo;re an awfully nice boy, but you are just a boy, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was losing his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of being grandmothered by
      you. I&rsquo;m older than you are, and I know what I&rsquo;m doing. Come, Helen,
      listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she would not listen, and although she was always kind and frank and
      friendly, she invariably refused to permit him to become sentimental. It
      irritated him, and after she had gone the irritation still remained. He
      wrote her as before, although not quite so often, and the letters were
      possibly not quite so long. His pride was hurt and the Speranza pride was
      a tender and important part of the Speranza being. If Helen noted any
      change in his letters she did not refer to it nor permit it to influence
      her own, which were, as always, lengthy, cheerful, and full of interest in
      him and his work and thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the previous fall, while under the new influence aroused in him by
      his discovery that Helen Kendall was &ldquo;the most wonderful girl in the
      world,&rdquo; said discovery of course having been previously made for him by
      the unfortunate Raymond, he had developed a habit of wandering off into
      the woods or by the seashore to be alone and to seek inspiration. When a
      young poet is in love, or fancies himself in love, inspiration is usually
      to be found wherever sought, but even at that age and to one in that
      condition solitude is a marked aid in the search. There were two or three
      spots which had become Albert Speranza&rsquo;s favorites. One was a high,
      wind-swept knoll, overlooking the bay, about a half mile from the hotel,
      another was a secluded nook in the pine grove beside Carver&rsquo;s Pond, a
      pretty little sheet of water on the Bayport boundary. On pleasant Saturday
      afternoons or Sundays, when the poetic fit was on him, Albert, with a half
      dozen pencils in his pocket, and a rhyming dictionary and a scribbling pad
      in another, was wont to stroll towards one or the other of these two
      retreats. There he would sprawl amid the beachgrass or upon the
      pine-needles and dream and think and, perhaps, ultimately write.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fair Saturday in late June he was at the first of these respective
      points. Lying prone on the beach grass at the top of the knoll and peering
      idly out between its stems at the water shimmering in the summer sun, he
      was endeavoring to find a subject for a poem which should deal with love
      and war as requested by the editor of the Columbian Magazine. &ldquo;Give us
      something with a girl and a soldier in it,&rdquo; the editor had written.
      Albert&rsquo;s mind was lazily drifting in search of the pleasing combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was warm, the breeze was light, the horizon was veiled with a
      liquid haze. Albert&rsquo;s mind was veiled with a similar haze and the idea he
      wanted would not come. He was losing his desire to find it and was, in
      fact, dropping into a doze when aroused by a blood-curdling outburst of
      barks and yelps and growls behind him, at his very heels. He came out of
      his nap with a jump and, scrambling to a sitting position and turning, he
      saw a small Boston bull-terrier standing within a yard of his ankles and,
      apparently, trying to turn his brindled outside in, or his inside out,
      with spiteful ferocity. Plainly the dog had come upon him unexpectedly and
      was expressing alarm, suspicion and disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert jerked his ankles out of the way and said &ldquo;Hello, boy,&rdquo; in as
      cheerfully cordial a tone as he could muster at such short notice. The dog
      took a step forward, evidently with the idea of always keeping the ankles
      within jumping distance, showed a double row of healthy teeth and growled
      and barked with renewed violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice dog,&rdquo; observed Albert. The nice dog made a snap at the nearest ankle
      and, balked of his prey by a frenzied kick of the foot attached to the
      ankle, shrieked, snarled and gurgled like a canine lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, you ugly brute,&rdquo; commanded the young man, losing patience, and
      looking about for a stone or stick. On the top of that knoll the largest
      stone was the size of a buckshot and the nearest stick was, to be Irish, a
      straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice doggie! Nice old boy! Come and be patted! . . . Clear out with you!
      Go home, you beast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flatteries and threats were alike in their result. The dog continued to
      snarl and growl, darting toward the ankles occasionally. Evidently he was
      mustering courage for the attack. Albert in desperation scooped up a
      handful of sand. If worst came to worst he might blind the creature
      temporarily. What would happen after that was not clear. Unless he might
      by a lucky cast fill the dog&rsquo;s interior so full of sand that&mdash;like
      the famous &ldquo;Jumping Frog&rdquo;&mdash;it would be too heavy to navigate, he saw
      no way of escape from a painful bite, probably more than one. What Captain
      Zelotes had formerly called his &ldquo;Portygee temper&rdquo; flared up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damn you, clear out!&rdquo; he shouted, springing to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a little way below him; in fact, from behind the next dune, between
      himself and the beach, a feminine voice called his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Speranza!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Is it you? I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned, but the moment he did so the dog made a dash at his legs,
      so he was obliged to turn back again and kick violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad it is you,&rdquo; said the voice again. &ldquo;I was sure it was a
      dreadful tramp. Googoo loathes tramps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As an article of diet that meant, probably. Googoo&mdash;if that was the
      dog&rsquo;s name&mdash;was passionately fond of poets, that was self-evident,
      and intended to make a meal of this one, forthwith. He flew at the
      Speranza ankles. Albert performed a most undignified war dance, and dashed
      his handful of sand into Googoo&rsquo;s open countenance. For a minute or so
      there was a lively shindy on top of that knoll. At the end of the minute
      the dog, held tightly in a pair of feminine arms, was emitting growls and
      coughs and sand, while Madeline Fosdick and Albert Speranza were kneeling
      in more sand and looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did he bite you?&rdquo; begged Miss Fosdick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No . . . no, I guess not,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&mdash;I scarcely know yet. .
      . . Why, when did you come? I didn&rsquo;t know you were in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came yesterday. Motored from home, you know. I&mdash;be still, Goo,
      you bad thing! It was such a lovely day that I couldn&rsquo;t resist going for a
      walk along the beach. I took Googoo because he does love it so, and&mdash;Goo,
      be still, I tell you! I am sure he thinks you are a tramp, out here all
      alone in the&mdash;in the wilderness. And what were you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert drew a long breath. &ldquo;I was half asleep, I guess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when he
      broke loose at my heels. I woke up quick enough then, as you may imagine.
      And so you are here for the summer? Your new house isn&rsquo;t finished, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not quite. Mother and Goo and I are at the hotel for a month. But you
      haven&rsquo;t answered my question. What were you doing off here all alone? Have
      you been for a walk, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. I&mdash;well, I come here pretty often. It is one of my
      favorite hiding places. You see, I . . . don&rsquo;t laugh if I tell you, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. Go on; this is very mysterious and interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I come here sometimes on pleasant days, to be alone&mdash;and
      write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write? Write poetry, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how wonderful! Were you writing when I&mdash;when Goo interrupted
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I had made two or three attempts, but nothing that I did satisfied
      me. I had just about decided to tear them up and to give up trying for
      this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope you won&rsquo;t tear them up. I&rsquo;m sure they shouldn&rsquo;t be. Perhaps
      you were not in a proper mood to judge, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. Perhaps they might look a little less hopeless to some one
      else. But that person would have to be really interested, and there are
      few people in South Harniss who know or care anything about poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is true. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose you would care to show
      them to me, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; eagerly, &ldquo;would you really care to see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I should! Not that my judgment or advice is worth anything, of
      course. But I am very, very fond of poetry, and to see how a real poet
      wrote would be wonderful. And if I could help you, even the least little
      bit, it would be such an honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sort of thing was balm to the Speranza spirit. Albert&rsquo;s temperamental
      ego expanded under it like a rosebud under a summer sun. Yet there was a
      faint shadow of doubt&mdash;she might be making fun of him. He looked at
      her intently and she seemed to read his thoughts, for she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mean it! Please believe I do. I haven&rsquo;t spoken that way when Jane
      was with me, for she wouldn&rsquo;t understand and would laugh, but I mean it,
      Mr. Speranza. It would be an honor&mdash;a great honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the still protesting and rebellious Googoo was compelled to go a few
      feet away and lie down, while his mistress and the young man whom he had
      attempted to devour bent their heads together over a scribbling-pad and
      talked and exclaimed during the whole of that hour and a full
      three-quarters of the next. Then the distant town clock in the steeple of
      the Congregational church boomed five times and Miss Fosdick rose to her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t really be five o&rsquo;clock, can it? But it is! What
      WILL mother fancy has become of me? I must go this minute. Thank you, Mr.
      Speranza. I have enjoyed this so much. It has been a wonderful
      experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were shining. She had grown handsomer
      than ever during the winter months. Albert&rsquo;s eyes were shining also as he
      impulsively seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Fosdick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have helped me more than I can
      tell you. I was about to give up in despair before you came, and now&mdash;now
      I KNOW I shall write the best thing I have ever done. And you will be
      responsible for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath. &ldquo;Oh, not really!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean
      it, really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do! If I might have your help and sympathy once in awhile, I
      believe&mdash;I believe I could do almost anything. Will you help me again
      some day? I shall be here almost every pleasant Saturday and Sunday
      afternoon. Will you come again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll see; perhaps,&rdquo; she answered hurriedly. &ldquo;But I
      must go now. Come, Goo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened away, down the knoll and along the beach toward the hotel.
      Googoo followed her, turning occasionally to cast diabolical glances at
      the Speranza ankles. Albert gazed until the graceful figure in the trim
      sport costume disappeared behind the corner of the point of the beach.
      Just at the point she paused to wave to him. He waved in return. Then he
      tramped homeward. There was deep sand beneath his feet and, later,
      pine-needles and grass. They were all alike to him, for he was traveling
      on air.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening at supper his radiant appearance caused comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you look so happy, Albert?&rdquo; asked his grandmother. &ldquo;Seems to
      me I never saw you look so sort of&mdash;well, glorified, as you might
      say. What is the reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The glorified one reddened and was confused. He stammered that he did not
      know, he was not aware of any particular reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis beamed upon him. &ldquo;I presume likely his bookkeepin&rsquo; at the
      office has been goin&rsquo; pretty well lately,&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelote&rsquo;s gray eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late he&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; up more
      poetry about girls,&rdquo; was his offering. &ldquo;Another one of those pieces about
      teeth like pearls and hair all curls, or somethin&rsquo; like that. Say, Al, why
      don&rsquo;t you poetry-makin&rsquo; fellers try a new one once in a while? Say, &lsquo;Her
      hair&rsquo;s like rope and her face has lost hope.&rsquo; Eh? Why not, for a change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The protests on the part of Olive and the housekeeper against the
      captain&rsquo;s innovation in poetry-making had the effect of distracting
      attention from Albert&rsquo;s &ldquo;glorified&rdquo; appearance. The young man himself was
      thankful for the respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night before he retired he took Madeline Fosdick&rsquo;s photograph from
      the back of the drawer among the ties and collars and looked at it for
      five minutes at least. She was a handsome girl, certainly. Not that that
      made any difference to him. And she was an intelligent girl; she
      understood his poetry and appreciated it. Yes, and she understood him,
      too, almost as well as Helen. . . . Helen! He hastily returned the Fosdick
      photograph to the drawer; but this time he did not put it quite so near
      the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Saturday he was early at the knoll, a brand-new
      scribbling-pad in his pocket and in his mind divine gems which were later,
      and with Miss Fosdick&rsquo;s assistance, to be strung into a glittering
      necklace of lyric song and draped, with the stringer&rsquo;s compliments, about
      the throat of a grateful muse. But no gems were strung that day. Madeline
      did not put in an appearance, and by and by it began to rain, and Albert
      walked home, damp, dejected, and disgusted. When, a day or two later, he
      met Miss Fosdick at the post office and asked why she had not come he
      learned that her mother had insisted upon a motor trip to Wapatomac that
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you surely mustn&rsquo;t expect me EVERY Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he admitted grudgingly, &ldquo;I suppose not. But you will come sometimes,
      won&rsquo;t you? I have a perfectly lovely idea for a ballad and I want to ask
      your advice about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you really? You&rsquo;re not making fun? You mean that my advice is
      really worth something? I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He convinced her that it was, and the next Saturday afternoon they spent
      together at the inspiration point among the dunes, at work upon the
      ballad. It was not finished on that occasion, nor on the next, for it was
      an unusually long ballad, but progress was made, glorious progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, during that Summer, as the Fosdick residence upon the Bay Road
      grew and grew, so did the acquaintanceship, the friendship, the poetic
      partnership between the Fosdick daughter and the grandson of Captain
      Zelotes Snow grow and grow. They met almost every Saturday, they met at
      the post office on week evenings, occasionally they saw each other for a
      moment after church on Sunday mornings. Mrs. Fletcher Fosdick could not
      imagine why her only child cared to attend that stuffy little country
      church and hear that prosy Kendall minister drone on and on. &ldquo;I hope, my
      dear, that I am as punctilious in my religious duties as the average
      woman, but one Kendall sermon was sufficient for me, thank you. What you
      see in THAT church to please you, <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she had attended as often as Madeline did she might have guessed and
      saved herself much. But she was busy organizing, in connection with Mrs.
      Seabury Calvin, a Literary Society among the summer people of South
      Harniss. The Society was to begin work with the discussion of the poetry
      of Rabindranath Tagore. Mrs. Fosdick said she doted on Tagore; Mrs. Calvin
      expressed herself as being positively insane about him. A warm friendship
      had sprung up between the two ladies, as each was particularly fond of
      shining as a literary light and neither under any circumstances permitted
      a new lion to roar unheard in her neighborhood, provided, of course, that
      the said roarings had been previously endorsed and well advertised by the
      critics and the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Fosdick was too busy to accompany Madeline to church on Sunday or
      to walk on Saturday, and the young lady was left to wander pretty much at
      her own sweet will. That sweet will led her footsteps to trails frequented
      by Albert Speranza and they walked and talked and poetized together. As
      for Mr. Fletcher Fosdick, he was busy at his office in New York and came
      to South Harniss only for infrequent week-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walks and talks and poetizings were innocent enough. Neither of the
      partners in poesy had the least idea of anything more than being just
      that. They liked each other, they had come to call each other by their
      Christian names, and on Albert&rsquo;s bureau Madeline&rsquo;s photograph now stood
      openly and without apology. Albert had convinced himself there was nothing
      to apologize for. She was his friend, that was all. He liked to write and
      she liked to help him&mdash;er&mdash;well, just as Helen used to when she
      was at home. He did not think of Helen quite as often as formerly, nor
      were his letters to her as frequent or as long.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the summer passed and late August came, the last Saturday afternoon of
      that month. Albert and Madeline were together, walking together along the
      beach from the knoll where they had met so often. It was six o&rsquo;clock and
      the beach was deserted. There was little wind, the tiny waves were lapping
      and plashing along the shore, and the rosy light of the sinking sun lay
      warm upon the water and the sand. They were thinking and speaking of the
      summer which was so near its end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a wonderful summer, hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wonderful,&rdquo; agreed Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I&mdash;by George, I never believed a summer could be so
      wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence. Then Albert, looking at her, saw her eyes looking into his and
      saw in them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning Albert Speranza had arisen as usual, a casual, careless,
      perfectly human young fellow. He went to bed that night a superman, an
      archangel, a demi-god, with his head in the clouds and the earth a cloth
      of gold beneath his feet. Life was a pathway through Paradise arched with
      rainbows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Madeline Fosdick loved each other madly, devotedly. They were
      engaged to be married. They had plighted troth. They were to be each
      other&rsquo;s, and no one else&rsquo;s, for ever&mdash;and ever&mdash;and ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The remainder of that summer was a paradisical meandering over the cloth
      of gold beneath the rainbows. Albert and his Madeline met often, very
      often. Few poems were written at these meetings. Why trouble to put
      penciled lines on paper when the entire universe was a poem especially
      composed for your benefit? The lovers sat upon the knoll amid the sand
      dunes and gazed at the bay and talked of themselves separately,
      individually, and, more especially, collectively. They strolled through
      the same woody lanes and discussed the same satisfactory subjects. They
      met at the post office or at the drug store and gazed into each other&rsquo;s
      eyes. And, what was the most astonishing thing about it all, their secret
      remained undiscovered. Undiscovered, that is to say, by those by whom
      discovery would have meant calamity. The gossips among the townspeople
      winked and chuckled and cal&rsquo;lated Fletcher Fosdick had better look out or
      his girl would be took into the firm of Z. Snow and Co. Issachar Price
      uttered sarcastic and sly innuendoes. Jane Kelsey and her set ragged the
      pair occasionally. But even these never really suspected that the affair
      was serious. And neither Mrs. Fletcher Fosdick nor Captain and Mrs.
      Zelotes Snow gave it a minute&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was serious enough with the principals, however. To them it was the
      only serious matter in the world. Not that they faced or discussed the
      future with earnest and complete attention. Some day or other&mdash;that
      was of course the mutually accepted idea&mdash;some day or other they were
      to marry. In the meantime here was the blissful present with its roses and
      rainbows and here, for each, was the other. What would be likely to happen
      when the Fosdick parents learned of the engagement of their only child to
      the assistant bookkeeper of the South Harniss lumber and hardware company
      was unpleasant to contemplate, so why contemplate it? Upon one point they
      were agreed&mdash;never, never, NEVER would they give each other up. No
      power on earth&mdash;which included parents and grandparents&mdash;should
      or could separate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s conscience troubled him slightly at first when he thought of
      Helen Kendall. It had been in reality such a short time&mdash;although of
      course it seemed ages and ages&mdash;since he had fancied himself in love
      with her. Only the previous fall&mdash;yes, even that very spring, he had
      asked her to pledge herself to him. Fortunately&mdash;oh, how very
      fortunately!&mdash;she had refused, and he had been left free. Now he knew
      that his fancied love for her had been merely a passing whim, a delusion
      of the moment. This&mdash;THIS which he was now experiencing was the grand
      passion of his life. He wrote a poem with the title, &ldquo;The Greater Love&rdquo;&mdash;and
      sold it, too, to a sensational periodical which circulated largely among
      sentimental shopgirls. It is but truthful to state that the editor of the
      magazine to which he first submitted it sent it back with the brief note&mdash;&ldquo;This
      is a trifle too syrupy for our use. Fear the pages might stick. Why not
      send us another war verse?&rdquo; Albert treated the note and the editor with
      the contempt they deserved. He pitied the latter; poor soul, doubtless HE
      had never known the greater love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Madeline had agreed that they would tell no one&mdash;no one at all&mdash;of
      their betrothal. It should be their own precious secret for the present.
      So, under the circumstances, he could not write Helen the news. But ought
      he to write her at all? That question bothered him not a little. He no
      longer loved her&mdash;in fact, he was now certain that he never had loved
      her&mdash;but he liked her, and he wanted her to keep on liking him. And
      she wrote to him with regularity. What ought he to do about writing her?
    </p>
    <p>
      He debated the question with himself and, at last, and with some
      trepidation, asked Madeline&rsquo;s opinion of his duty in the matter. Her
      opinion was decisive and promptly given. Of course he must not write Helen
      again. &ldquo;How would you like it if I corresponded with another fellow?&rdquo; she
      asked. Candor forced him to admit that he should not like it at all. &ldquo;But
      I want to behave decently,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is merely a friend of mine&rdquo;&mdash;oh,
      how short is memory!&mdash;&ldquo;but we have been friends for a long time and I
      wouldn&rsquo;t want to hurt her feelings.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, instead you prefer to hurt
      mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, dearest, be reasonable.&rdquo; It was their nearest approach to a
      quarrel and was a very, very sad affair. The making-up was sweet, of
      course, but the question of further correspondence with Helen Kendall
      remained just where it was at the beginning. And, meanwhile, the
      correspondence lapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      September came far, far too soon&mdash;came and ended. And with it ended
      also the stay of the Fosdicks in South Harniss. Albert and Madeline said
      good-by at their rendezvous by the beach. It was a sad, a tearful, but a
      very precious farewell. They would write each other every day, they would
      think of each other every minute of every day, they would live through the
      winter somehow and look forward to the next spring and their next meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write&mdash;oh, ever and ever so many poems, won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo;
       begged Madeline. &ldquo;You know how I love them. And whenever I see one of your
      poems in print I shall be so proud of you&mdash;of MY poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert promised to write ever and ever so many. He felt that there would
      be no difficulty in writing reams of poems&mdash;inspired, glorious poems.
      The difficulty would be in restraining himself from writing too many of
      them. With Madeline Fosdick as an inspiration, poetizing became as natural
      as breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, which was unusual for them, they spoke of the future, the dim,
      vague, but so happy future, when Albert was to be the nation&rsquo;s poet
      laureate and Madeline, as Mrs. Laureate, would share his glory and wear,
      so to speak, his second-best laurels. The disagreeable problems connected
      with the future they ignored, or casually dismissed with, &ldquo;Never mind,
      dear, it will be all right by and by.&rdquo; Oh, it was a wonderful afternoon, a
      rosy, cloudy, happy, sorrowful, bitter-sweet afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next morning Albert, peeping beneath Z. Snow and Co.&lsquo;s office
      window shade, saw his heart&rsquo;s desire step aboard the train, saw that train
      puff out of the station, saw for just an instant a small hand waved behind
      the dingy glass of the car window. His own hand waved in reply. Then the
      raucous voice of Mr. Price broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was you flappin&rsquo; your flipper at?&rdquo; inquired Issachar. &ldquo;Girl, I&rsquo;ll bet
      you! Never saw such a critter as you be to chase after the girls. Which
      one is it this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert made no reply. Between embarrassment and sorrow he was incapable of
      speech. Issachar, however, was not in that condition; at all times when
      awake, and sometimes when asleep, Mr. Price could, and usually did, speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one is it this time, Al?&rdquo; demanded Issy. &ldquo;Eh? Crimus, see him get
      red! Haw, haw! Labe,&rdquo; to Mr. Keeler, who came into the office from the
      inner room, &ldquo;which girl do you cal&rsquo;late Al here is wavin&rsquo; by-bye to this
      mornin&rsquo;? Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away on the cars this mornin&rsquo;, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban, his hands full of the morning mail, absently replied that he didn&rsquo;t
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do, too,&rdquo; persisted Issy. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t listenin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s all.
      Who&rsquo;s leavin&rsquo; town on the train just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. The Small folks are goin&rsquo; to Boston, I believe. And
      George Bartlett&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to Ostable on court business, he told me. Oh, yes,
      I believe Cap&rsquo;n Lote said that Fosdick woman and her daughter were goin&rsquo; 
      back to New York. Back to New York&mdash;yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price crowed triumphantly. &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; he crowed. &ldquo;Ah, ha! That&rsquo;s the
      answer. That&rsquo;s the one he&rsquo;s shakin&rsquo; day-days to, that Fosdick girl. I&rsquo;ve
      seen you &lsquo;round with her at the post office and the ice cream s&rsquo;loon. I&rsquo;m
      onto you, Al. Haw, haw! What&rsquo;s her name? Adeline? Dandelion? Madeline?&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      it! Say, how do you think Helen Kendall&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to like your throwin&rsquo; 
      kisses to the Madeline one, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant bookkeeper was still silent. The crimson, however, was
      leaving his face and the said face was paling rapidly. This was an ominous
      sign had Mr. Price but known it. He did not know it and cackled merrily
      on,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to tell Helen when she comes back home,&rdquo; he announced.
      &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll put a flea in her ear. &lsquo;Helen,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t feel too
      bad now, don&rsquo;t cry and get your handkerchief all soakin&rsquo;, or nothin&rsquo; like
      that. I just feel it&rsquo;s my duty to tell ye that your little Albert is
      sparkin&rsquo; up to somebody else. He&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; on a party by the name of
      Padeline&mdash;no, Madeline&mdash;Woodtick&mdash;no, Fosdick&mdash;and . .
      .&rsquo; Here! let go of me! What are you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That last question was in the nature of a gurgle. Albert, his face now
      very white indeed, had strode across the office, seized the speaker by the
      front of his flannel shirt and backed him against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; commanded Albert, between his teeth. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of that. Don&rsquo;t
      you say any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Ugh! Ur-gg! Leggo of my shirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert let go, but he did not step back. He remained where he was, exactly
      in front of Mr. Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you say any more about&mdash;about what you were saying,&rdquo; he
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Not say any more? Why not? Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stop me, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know! What&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If you weren&rsquo;t so old, I would&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll stop you,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert felt a hand on his arm and heard Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s voice at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful, Al, careful,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I shan&rsquo;t hit him,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;What do you think I am? But he
      must promise not to mention&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Fosdick&rsquo;s name again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better promise, Is,&rdquo; suggested Laban. Issachar&rsquo;s mouth opened, but no
      promise came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise be darned!&rdquo; he yelled furiously. &ldquo;Mention her name! I&rsquo;ll mention
      any name I set out to, and no Italyun Portygee is goin&rsquo; to stop me,
      neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert glanced about the office. By the wall stood two brimming pails of
      water, brought in by Mr. Price for floor-washing purposes. He lifted one
      of the pails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll duck you,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let go of me, Keeler,
      I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful, Al, careful,&rdquo; said Mr. Keeler. &ldquo;Better promise, Is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise nawthin&rsquo;! Fosdick! What in time do I care for Fosdicks, Madelines
      or Padelines or Dandelions or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sentence stopped just there. The remainder of it was washed back and
      down his throat by the deluge from the bucket. Overcome by shock and
      surprise, Mr. Price leaned back against the wall and slid slowly down that
      wall until he reclined in a sitting posture, upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crimustee,&rdquo; he gasped, as soon as he could articulate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;awk&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      drownded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert put down the empty bucket and picked up the full one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban Keeler rubbed his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d promise if I was you, Is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re some subject to
      rheumatism, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar, sitting in a spreading puddle, looked damply upward at the
      remaining bucket. &ldquo;By crimustee&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Albert drew the bucket
      backward; the water dripped from its lower brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;darn ye, I promise!&rdquo; shouted Issachar. Albert put down
      the bucket and walked back to his desk. Laban watched him curiously,
      smiling just a little. Then he turned to Mr. Price, who was scrambling to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better get your mop and swab up here, Is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;ll be in
      &lsquo;most any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Captain Zelotes did return to the office, Issachar was industriously
      sweeping out, Albert was hard at work at the books, and Laban was still
      rubbing his chin and smiling at nothing in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Albert and Issachar made it up. Albert apologized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Issy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but you made me
      mad. I have a&mdash;rather mean temper, I&rsquo;m afraid. Forgive me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, and Issachar, after a momentary hesitation, took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you this time, Al,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t never do
      nothin&rsquo; like it again, will ye? When I went home for dinner yesterday noon
      I give you my word my clothes was kind of dampish even then. If it hadn&rsquo;t
      been nice warm sunshine and I was out doors and dried off considerable I&rsquo;d
      a had to change everything, underclothes and all, and &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t but the
      middle of the week yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His ducking had an effect which Albert noticed with considerable
      satisfaction&mdash;he was never quite as flippantly personal in his
      comments concerning the assistant bookkeeper. He treated the latter, if
      not with respect, at least with something distantly akin to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Madeline&rsquo;s departure the world was very lonely indeed. Albert wrote
      long, long letters and received replies which varied in length but never
      in devotion. Miss Fosdick was obliged to be cautious in her correspondence
      with her lover. &ldquo;You will forgive me if this is not much more than a note,
      won&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Mother seems to be very curious of late
      about my letters and to whom I write and I had to just steal the
      opportunity this morning.&rdquo; An older and more apprehensive person might
      have found Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s sudden interest in her daughter&rsquo;s correspondence
      suspicious and a trifle alarming, but Albert never dreamed of being
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote many poems, all dealing with love and lovers, and sold some of
      them. He wrote no more letters to Helen. She, too, had ceased to write
      him, doubtless because of the lack of reply to her last two or three
      letters. His conscience still troubled him about Helen; he could not help
      feeling that his treatment of her had not been exactly honorable. Yet what
      else under the circumstances could he do? From Mr. Kendall he learned that
      she was coming home to spend Thanksgiving. He would see her then. She
      would ask him questions? What should his answer be? He faced the situation
      in anticipation many, many times, usually after he had gone to bed at
      night, and lay awake through long torturing hours in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at last Helen and he did meet, the day before Thanksgiving, their
      meeting was not at all the dreadful ordeal he had feared. Her greeting was
      as frank and cordial as it had always been, and there was no reproach in
      her tone or manner. She did not even ask him why he had stopped writing.
      It was he, himself, who referred to that subject, and he did so as they
      walked together down the main road. Just why he referred to it he could
      not probably have told. He was aware only that he felt mean and
      contemptible and that he must offer some explanation. His not having any
      to offer made the task rather difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she saved him the trouble. She interrupted one of his blundering,
      stumbling sentences in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Albert,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t explain. I think I
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and stared at her. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why,
      no, you don&rsquo;t. You can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can, or I think I can. You have changed your mind, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed my mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you remember I told you you would change your mind about&mdash;well,
      about me? You were so sure you cared so very, very much for me, you know.
      And I said you mustn&rsquo;t promise anything because I thought you would change
      your mind. And you have. That is it, isn&rsquo;t it? You have found some one
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her as if she were a witch who had performed a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;well, by George!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Helen&mdash;how&mdash;how
      did you know? Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one told me. But I think I can even guess who it is you have found. It
      is Madeline Fosdick, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His amazement now was so open-mouthed as well as open-eyed that she could
      not help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! Don&rsquo;t stare at me like that,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Every one is looking
      at you. There is old Captain Pease on the other side of the street; I&rsquo;m
      sure he thinks you have had a stroke or something. Here! Walk down our
      road a little way toward home with me. We can talk as we walk. I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
       she added, with just the least bit of change in her tone, &ldquo;that your
      Madeline won&rsquo;t object to our being together to that extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way down the side street toward the parsonage and he followed
      her. He was still speechless from surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she went on, after a moment, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you going to say anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, Helen,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;how did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again. &ldquo;Then it IS Madeline,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought it must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you thought&mdash;What made you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she seemed on the point of losing her patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned and laid her hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Al,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t think I am altogether an idiot. I
      surmised when your letters began to grow shorter and&mdash;well, different&mdash;that
      there was something or some one who was changing them, and I suspected it
      was some one. When you stopped writing altogether, I KNEW there must be.
      Then father wrote in his letters about you and about meeting you, and so
      often Madeline Fosdick was wherever he met you. So I guessed&mdash;and,
      you see, I guessed right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if you only knew how mean I have felt and how
      ashamed I am of the way I have treated you! But, you see, I&mdash;I
      COULDN&rsquo;T write you and tell you because we had agreed to keep it a secret.
      I couldn&rsquo;t tell ANY ONE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is as serious as that! Are you two really and truly engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There! I&rsquo;ve told it, and I swore I would never tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you didn&rsquo;t tell. I guessed. Now tell me all about her. She is
      very lovely. Is she as sweet as she looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rhapsodized for five minutes. Then all at once he realized what he was
      saying and to whom he was saying it. He stopped, stammering, in the very
      middle of a glowing eulogium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Helen reassuringly. But he could not go on, under the
      circumstances. Instead he turned very red. As usual, she divined his
      thought, noticed his confusion, and took pity on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be awfully nice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you fell in love
      with her. I wish I might know her better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you might. By and by you must. And she must know you. Helen, I&mdash;I
      feel so ashamed of&mdash;of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, or I shall begin to think you are ashamed because you liked me&mdash;or
      thought you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do like you. Next to Madeline there is no one I like so much. But,
      but, you see, it is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. And it ought to be. Does her mother&mdash;do her people
      know of the engagement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated momentarily. &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t yet. She and I
      have decided to keep it a secret from any one for the present. I want to
      get on a little further with my writing, you know. She is like you in
      that, Helen&mdash;she&rsquo;s awfully fond of poetry and literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially yours, I&rsquo;m sure. Tell me about your writing. How are you
      getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he told her and, until they stood together at the parsonage gate,
      Madeline&rsquo;s name was not again mentioned. Then Helen put out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we have had this talk, ever so
      glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, so am I! You&rsquo;re a corking friend, Helen. The chap who does
      marry you will be awfully lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled slightly. &ldquo;Perhaps there won&rsquo;t be any such chap,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      shall always be a schoolmarm, I imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;I have too high an opinion of men for
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled again, seemed about to speak, and then to change her mind. An
      instant later she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go in now. But I shall hope to see you again before I go back to
      the city. And, after your secret is out and the engagement is announced, I
      want to write Madeline, may I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you may. And she&rsquo;ll like you as much as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she? . . . Well, perhaps; we&rsquo;ll hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly she will. And you won&rsquo;t let my treating you as&mdash;as I have
      make any difference in our friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We shall always be friends, I hope. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the house. He waited a moment, hoping she might turn again
      before entering, but she did not. He walked home, pondering deeply, his
      thoughts a curious jumble of relief and dissatisfaction. He was glad Helen
      had seen her duty and given him over to Madeline, but he felt a trifle
      piqued to think she had done it with such apparent willingness. If she had
      wept or scolded it would have been unpleasant but much more gratifying to
      his self-importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not help realizing, however, that her attitude toward him was
      exceptionally fine. He knew well that he, if in her place, would not have
      behaved as she had done. No spite, no sarcasm, no taunts, no unpleasant
      reminders of things said only a few months before. And with all her
      forgiveness and forbearance and understanding there had been always that
      sense of greater age and wisdom; she had treated him as she might have
      treated a boy, younger brother, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She IS older than I am,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;even if she really isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s
      funny, but it&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      December came and Christmas, and then January and the new year, the year
      1917. In January, Z. Snow and Co. took its yearly account of stock, and
      Captain Lote and Laban and Albert and Issachar were truly busy during the
      days of stock-taking week and tired when evening came. Laban worked the
      hardest of the quartette, but Issy made the most fuss about it. Labe, who
      had chosen the holiday season to go on one of his periodical vacations, as
      rather white and shaky and even more silent than usual. Mr. Price,
      however, talked with his customary fluency and continuity, so there was no
      lack of conversation. Captain Zelotes was moved to comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Issy,&rdquo; he suggested gravely, looking up from a long column of figures,
      &ldquo;did you ever play &lsquo;Door&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play &lsquo;Door&rsquo;?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game. Didn&rsquo;t you ever play it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I ever did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better begin right this minute. The first thing to do is to
      shut up and the next is to stay that way. You play &lsquo;Door&rsquo; until I tell you
      to do somethin&rsquo; else; d&rsquo;you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home the week between Christmas and the New Year was rather dismal. Mr.
      Keeler&rsquo;s holiday vacation had brought on one of his fiancee&rsquo;s &ldquo;sympathetic
      attacks,&rdquo; and she tied up her head and hung crape upon her soul, as usual.
      During these attacks the Snow household walked on tiptoe, as if the
      housekeeper were an invalid in reality. Even consoling speeches from
      Albert, who with Laban when the latter was sober, enjoyed in her mind the
      distinction of being the reincarnation of &ldquo;Robert Penfold,&rdquo; brought no
      relief to the suffering Rachel. Nothing but the news brought by the
      milkman, that &ldquo;Labe was taperin&rsquo; off,&rdquo; and would probably return to his
      desk in a few days, eased her pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      One forenoon about the middle of the month Captain Zelotes himself stopped
      in at the post office for the morning mail. When he returned to the lumber
      company&rsquo;s building he entered quietly and walked to his own desk with a
      preoccupied air. For the half hour before dinner time he sat there,
      smoking his pipe, and speaking to no one unless spoken to. The office
      force noticed his preoccupation and commented upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails the old man, Al?&rdquo; whispered Issachar, peering in around the
      corner of the door at the silent figure tilted back in the revolving
      chair, its feet upon the corner of the desk. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t said so much as &lsquo;Boo&rsquo; 
      for up&rsquo;ards of twenty minutes, has he? I was in there just now fillin&rsquo; up
      his ink-stand and, by crimus, I let a great big gob of ink come down
      ker-souse right in the middle of the nice, clean blottin&rsquo; paper in front
      of him. I held my breath, cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to catch what Stephen Peter used to
      say he caught when he went fishin&rsquo; Sundays. Stevey said he generally
      caught cold when he went and always caught the Old Harry when he got back.
      I cal&rsquo;lated to catch the Old Harry part sure, &lsquo;cause Captain Lote is
      always neat and fussy &lsquo;bout his desk. But no, the old man never said a
      word. I don&rsquo;t believe he knew the ink was spilled at all. What&rsquo;s on his
      mind, Al; do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not know, so he asked Laban. Laban shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up, Al,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s happened to bother him, that&rsquo;s
      sartin&rsquo;. When Cap&rsquo;n Lote gets his feet propped up and his head tilted back
      that way I can &lsquo;most generally cal&rsquo;late he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; some real thinkin&rsquo;.
      Real thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;yes, sir-ee&mdash;um-hm&mdash;yes&mdash;yes. When he
      h&rsquo;ists his boots up to the masthead that way it&rsquo;s safe to figger his
      brains have got steam up. Um-hm&mdash;yes indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is he thinking about? And why is he so quiet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give up both riddles, Al. He&rsquo;s the only one&rsquo;s got the answers and when
      he gets ready enough maybe he&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;em. Until then it&rsquo;ll pay us fo&rsquo;mast
      hands to make believe we&rsquo;re busy, even if we ain&rsquo;t. Hear that, do you,
      Is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo; demanded Issachar, who was gazing out of the window, his
      hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it will pay us&mdash;you and Al and me&mdash;to make believe we&rsquo;re
      workin&rsquo; even if we ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Workin&rsquo;!&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;By crimus, I AM workin&rsquo;! I don&rsquo;t have to make
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Well, then, I&rsquo;d pick up that coal-hod and make believe play for
      a spell. The fire&rsquo;s &lsquo;most out. Almost&mdash;um-hm&mdash;pretty nigh&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert and his grandfather walked home to dinner together, as was their
      custom, but still the captain remained silent. During dinner he spoke not
      more than a dozen words and Albert several times caught Mrs. Snow
      regarding her husband intently and with a rather anxious look. She did not
      question him, however, but Rachel was not so reticent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;what IS the matter? You&rsquo;re as
      dumb as a mouthful of mush. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve said ay, yes or no
      since we sat down to table. Are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her employer&rsquo;s calm was unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he answered, with deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a comfort. What&rsquo;s the matter, then; don&rsquo;t you WANT to talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; with a toss of the head, &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m glad I know. I was beginnin&rsquo; to
      be afraid you&rsquo;d forgotten how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain helped himself to another fried &ldquo;tinker&rdquo; mackerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger of that around here, Rachel,&rdquo; he said serenely. &ldquo;So long as my
      hearin&rsquo;s good I couldn&rsquo;t forget&mdash;not in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive detained her grandson as he was following Captain Zelotes from the
      dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with him, Albert?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Grandmother. Do you think there is anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; troublin&rsquo; him. I&rsquo;ve lived with him too many
      years not to know the signs. Oh, Albert&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t done anything to
      displease him, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Grandmother. Whatever it is, it isn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the office, the captain spoke to Mr. Keeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your dinner, Labe?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, indeed. Don&rsquo;t take me long to eat&mdash;not at my boardin&rsquo; 
      house. A feller&rsquo;d have to have paralysis to make eatin&rsquo; one of Lindy
      Dadgett&rsquo;s meals take more&rsquo;n a half hour. Um-hm&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite his preoccupation, Captain Zelotes could not help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make it take an hour he&rsquo;d have to be ossified, wouldn&rsquo;t he, like the
      feller in the circus sideshow?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban nodded. &ldquo;That&mdash;or dead,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;just about&mdash;just
      so, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Issachar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; yet, I cal&rsquo;late. He don&rsquo;t board at Lindy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he gets back set him to pilin&rsquo; that new carload of spruce under
      Number Three shed. Keep him at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Um-hm. All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes turned to his grandson. &ldquo;Come in here, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      want to see you for a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert followed him into the inner office. He wondered what in the world
      his grandfather wished to see him about, in this very private fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Al,&rdquo; said the captain, taking his own chair and pointing to
      another. &ldquo;Oh, wait a minute, though! Maybe you&rsquo;d better shut that hatch
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; was the transom over the door between the offices. Albert,
      remembering how a previous interview between them had been overheard
      because of that open transom, glanced at his grandfather. The twinkle in
      the latter&rsquo;s eye showed that he too, remembered. Albert closed the
      &ldquo;hatch.&rdquo; When he came back to his seat the twinkle had disappeared;
      Captain Zelotes looked serious enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Grandfather?&rdquo; queried the young man, after waiting a moment. The
      captain adjusted his spectacles, reached into the inside pocket of his
      coat and produced an envelope. It was a square envelope with either a
      trade-mark or a crest upon the back. Captain Lote did not open the
      envelope, but instead tapped his desk with it and regarded his grandson in
      a meditative way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;has it seemed to you that your cruise aboard this
      craft of ours here had been a little smoother the last year or two than it
      used to be afore that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, by this time well accustomed to his grandfather&rsquo;s nautical
      phraseology, understood that the &ldquo;cruise&rdquo; referred to was his voyage as
      assistant bookkeeper with Z. Snow and Co. He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to make it so,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I mean I have tried to make it
      smoother for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm, I think you have tried. I don&rsquo;t mind tellin&rsquo; you that it has
      pleased me consid&rsquo;ble to watch you try. I don&rsquo;t mean by that,&rdquo; he added,
      with a slight curve of the lip, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d win first prize as a
      lightnin&rsquo;-calculator even yet, but you&rsquo;re a whole lot better one than you
      used to be. I&rsquo;ve been considerable encouraged about you; I don&rsquo;t mind
      tellin&rsquo; you that either. . . . And,&rdquo; he added, after another interval
      during which he was, apparently, debating just how much of an admission it
      was safe to make, &ldquo;so far as I can see, this poetry foolishness of yours
      hasn&rsquo;t interfered with your work any to speak of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;Thanks, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. So much for that. But there&rsquo;s another side to our
      relations together, yours and mine, that I haven&rsquo;t spoken of to you afore.
      And I have kept still on purpose. I&rsquo;ve figgered that so long as you kept
      straight and didn&rsquo;t go off the course, didn&rsquo;t drink or gamble, or go wild
      or the like of that, what you did was pretty much your own business. I&rsquo;ve
      noticed you&rsquo;re considerable of a feller with the girls, but I kept an eye
      on the kind of girls and I will say that so far as I can see, you&rsquo;ve
      picked the decent kind. I say so far as I can see. Of course I ain&rsquo;t fool
      enough to believe I see all you do, or know all you do. I&rsquo;ve been young
      myself, and when I get to thinkin&rsquo; how much I know about you I try to set
      down and remember how much my dad didn&rsquo;t know about me when I was your
      age. That&mdash;er&mdash;helps some toward givin&rsquo; me my correct position
      on the chart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused. Albert&rsquo;s brain was vainly striving to guess what all this
      meant. What was he driving at? The captain crossed his legs and continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did think for a spell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you and Helen Kendall were
      gettin&rsquo; to understand each other pretty well. Well, Helen&rsquo;s a good girl
      and your grandma and I like her. Course we didn&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late anything very
      serious was liable to come of the understandin&rsquo;, not for some time,
      anyhow, for with your salary and&mdash;well, sort of unsettled prospects,
      I gave you credit for not figgerin&rsquo; on pickin&rsquo; a wife right away. . . .
      Haven&rsquo;t got much laid by to support a wife on, have you, Al?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s expression had changed during the latter portion of the speech.
      Now he was gazing intently at his grandfather and at the letter in the
      latter&rsquo;s hands. He was beginning to guess, to dread, to be fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got much to support a wife on, Al, have you?&rdquo; repeated Captain
      Zelotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um. . . . But you hope to have by and by, eh? Well, I hope you will. But
      UNTIL you have it would seem to older folks like me kind of risky
      navigatin&rsquo; to&mdash;to . . . Oh, there was a letter in the mail for you
      this mornin, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down the envelope he had hitherto held in his hand and, reaching
      into his pocket, produced another. Even before he had taken it from his
      grandfather&rsquo;s hand Albert recognized the handwriting. It was from
      Madeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes, regarding him keenly, leaned back again in his chair.
      &ldquo;Read it if you want to, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better. I can wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert hesitated a moment and then tore open the envelope. The note within
      was short, evidently written in great haste and agitation and was spotted
      with tear stains. He read it, his cheeks paling and his hand shaking as he
      did so. Something dreadful had happened. Mother&mdash;Mrs. Fosdick, of
      course&mdash;had discovered everything. She had found all his&mdash;Albert&rsquo;s&mdash;letters
      and read them. She was furious. There had been the most terrible scene.
      Madeline was in her own room and was smuggling him this letter by Mary,
      her maid, who will do anything for me, and has promised to mail it. Oh,
      dearest, they say I must give you up. They say&mdash;Oh, they say dreadful
      things about you! Mother declares she will take me to Japan or some
      frightful place and keep me there until I forget you. I don&rsquo;t care if they
      take me to the ends of the earth, I shall NEVER forget you. I will never&mdash;never&mdash;NEVER
      give you up. And you mustn&rsquo;t give me up, will you, darling? They say I
      must never write you again. But you see I have&mdash;and I shall. Oh, what
      SHALL we do? I was SO happy and now I am so miserable. Write me the minute
      you get this, but oh, I KNOW they won&rsquo;t let me see your letters and then I
      shall die. But write, write just the same, every day. Oh what SHALL we do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, always and always, no matter what everyone does or says, lovingly
      and devotedly,
    </p>
    <p>
      MADELINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reading was finished Albert sat silently staring at the floor,
      seeing it through a wet mist. Captain Zelotes watched him, his heavy brows
      drawn together and the smoke wreaths from his pipe curling slowly upward
      toward the office ceiling. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Al, I had a letter, too. I presume likely it came from the same
      port even if not from the same member of the family. It&rsquo;s about you, and I
      think you&rsquo;d better read it, maybe. I&rsquo;ll read it to you, if you&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head and held out his hand for the second letter. His
      grandfather gave it to him, saying as he did so: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you
      understand, Al, that I don&rsquo;t necessarily believe all that she says about
      you in this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Grandfather,&rdquo; mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The second letter was, as he had surmised, from Mrs. Fosdick. It had
      evidently been written at top speed and at a mental temperature well above
      the boiling point. Mrs. Fosdick addressed Captain Zelotes Snow because she
      had been given to understand that he was the nearest relative, or
      guardian, or whatever it was, of the person concerning whom the letter was
      written and therefore, it was presumed, might be expected to have some
      measure of control over that person&rsquo;s actions. The person was, of course,
      one Albert Speranza, and Mrs. Fosdick proceeded to set forth her version
      of his conduct in sentences which might almost have blistered the paper.
      Taking advantage of her trust in her daughter&rsquo;s good sense and ability to
      take care of herself&mdash;which trust it appeared had been in a measure
      misplaced&mdash;he, the Speranza person, had sneakingly, underhandedly and
      in a despicably clandestine fashion&mdash;the lady&rsquo;s temper had rather
      gotten away from her here&mdash;succeeded in meeting her daughter in
      various places and by various disgraceful means and had furthermore
      succeeded in ensnaring her youthful affections, et cetera, et cetera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor child actually believes herself in love with him,&rdquo; wrote the
      poor child&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;She protests ridiculously that she is engaged to him
      and will marry him in spite of her father or myself or the protests of
      sensible people. I write to you, therefore, assuming you likewise to be a
      sensible person, and requesting that you use your influence with the&mdash;to
      put the most charitable interpretation of his conduct&mdash;misguided and
      foolish young man and show him the preposterous folly of his pretended
      engagement to my daughter. Of course the whole affair, CORRESPONDENCE
      INCLUDED, must cease and terminate AT ONCE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on for two more pages. The color had returned to Albert&rsquo;s cheeks
      long before he finished reading. When he had finished he rose to his feet
      and, throwing the letter upon his grandfather&rsquo;s desk, turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Al?&rdquo; queried Captain Zelotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s face, when he turned back to answer, was whiter than ever, but
      his eyes flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;that stuff about my being a&mdash;a sneak and&mdash;and
      ensnaring her&mdash;and all the rest? Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain took his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, son, steady,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you before you begun to
      read at all that I didn&rsquo;t necessarily believe it because that woman wrote
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you or no one else had better believe it. It&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so. But there&rsquo;s a little mite of
      truth here and there amongst the lies, I presume likely. For instance, you
      and this Fosdick girl have been&mdash;er&mdash;keepin&rsquo; company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Madeline&mdash;and we are engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Hum&mdash;I see&mdash;I see. And, bein&rsquo; as the old lady&mdash;her
      mother, Mrs. Fosdick, I mean&mdash;hasn&rsquo;t suspected anything, or, at any
      rate, hasn&rsquo;t found out anything until now, yesterday, or whenever it was,
      I judge you have been meetin&rsquo;&mdash;er&mdash;Madeline at places where
      there wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;well, too large a crowd. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert hesitated and was, momentarily, a trifle embarrassed. But he
      recovered at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met her first at the drug store last summer,&rdquo; he said defiantly. &ldquo;Then
      I met her after that at the post office and at the hotel dance last fall,
      and so on. This year I met her&mdash;well, I met her first down by the
      beach, where I went to write. She liked poetry and&mdash;and she helped me
      with mine. After that she came&mdash;well, she came to help me again. And
      after that&mdash;after that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that it just moved along kind of natural, eh? Um-hm, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Grandfather, I want you to understand that she is&mdash;is&mdash;by
      George, she is the cleanest, finest, best girl in the world. Don&rsquo;t you get
      the idea that&mdash;that she isn&rsquo;t. She came to meet me just because she
      was interested in my verse and wanted to help. It wasn&rsquo;t until the very
      last that we&mdash;that we found out we cared for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, boy, all right. Go on, tell me the whole yarn, if you feel
      like it. I don&rsquo;t want to pry too much into your affairs, but, after all, I
      AM interested in those affairs, Al. Tell me as much as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole. There&rsquo;s nothing I can&rsquo;t tell, nothing I&rsquo;m not
      proud to tell. By George, I ought to be proud! Why, Grandfather, she&rsquo;s
      wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, son, sartin. They always are. I mean she is, of course. Heave
      ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Albert told his love story. When he had finished Captain Zelote&rsquo;s pipe
      was empty, and he put it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I judge you mean this thing seriously. You mean
      to marry her some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed I do. And I won&rsquo;t give her up, either. Her mother&mdash;why,
      what right has her mother got to say&mdash;to treat her in this way? Or to
      call me what she calls me in that letter? Why, by George&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy, son. As I understand it, this Madeline of yours is the only child
      the Fosdicks have got and when our only child is in danger of bein&rsquo; 
      carried off by somebody else&mdash;why, well, their mothers and fathers
      are liable to be just a little upset, especially if it comes on &lsquo;em
      sudden. . . . Nobody knows that better than I do,&rdquo; he added slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert recognized the allusion, but he was not in the mood to be affected
      by it. He was not, just then, ready to make allowances for any one,
      particularly the parental Fosdicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no business to be upset&mdash;not like that, anyhow,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;What does that woman know about me? What right has she to say
      that I ensnared Madeline&rsquo;s affection and all that rot? Madeline and I fell
      in love with each other, just as other people have, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suppose right,&rdquo; observed Captain Zelotes, dryly. &ldquo;Other people have&mdash;a
      good many of &lsquo;em since Adam&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! And what right has she to give orders that I stop writing or
      seeing Madeline,&mdash;all that idiotic stuff about ceasing and
      terminating at once? She&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo; His agitation was making him
      incoherent&mdash;&ldquo;She talks like Lord Somebody-or-other in an
      old-fashioned novel or play or something. Those old fools were always
      rejecting undesirable suitors and ordering their daughters to do this and
      that, breaking their hearts, and so on. But that sort of thing doesn&rsquo;t go
      nowadays. Young people have their own ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm, Al; so I&rsquo;ve noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed they have. Now, if Madeline wants to marry me and I want to
      marry her, who will stop us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain pulled at his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nobody, Al, as I know of,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;provided you both keep on
      wantin&rsquo; to marry each other long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep on wanting long enough? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothin&rsquo; much, perhaps; only gettin&rsquo; married isn&rsquo;t all just goin&rsquo; to
      the parson. After the ceremony the rent begins and the grocers&rsquo; bills and
      the butchers&rsquo; and the bakers&rsquo; and a thousand or so more. Somebody&rsquo;s got to
      pay &lsquo;em, and the money&rsquo;s got to come from somewhere. Your wages here, Al,
      poetry counted in, ain&rsquo;t so very big yet. Better wait a spell before you
      settle down to married life, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say we were to be married right away,
      Grandfather. She and I aren&rsquo;t unreasonable. I&rsquo;m doing better and better
      with my writings. Some day I&rsquo;ll make enough, and more. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was enough of the Speranza egotism in this confident assurance to
      bring the twinkle to the captain&rsquo;s eye. He twisted his beard between his
      finger and thumb and regarded his grandson mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea how much &lsquo;enough&rsquo; is liable to be, Al?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know the facts about &lsquo;em, of course, but from what I have heard I
      judge the Fosdicks have got plenty of cash. I&rsquo;ve heard it estimated around
      town from one million to fifty millions. Allowin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s only one million,
      it seems likely that your&mdash;er&mdash;what&rsquo;s-her-name&mdash;Madeline
      has been used to havin&rsquo; as much as fifty cents to spend whenever she
      wanted it. Do you cal&rsquo;late to be able to earn enough makin&rsquo; up poetry to
      keep her the way her folks have been doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not&mdash;not at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but later on&mdash;when the market price of poetry has gone up&mdash;you
      can, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Grandfather, if you&rsquo;re making fun of me I tell you I won&rsquo;t
      stand it. This is serious; I mean it. Madeline and I are going to be
      married some time and no one can stop us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, son, all right. But it did seem to me that in the light of
      this letter from&mdash;er&mdash;your mother-in-law that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be, we
      ought to face the situation moderately square, anyhow. First comes
      marriage. Well, that&rsquo;s easy; any fool can get married, lots of &lsquo;em do. But
      then, as I said, comes supportin&rsquo; yourself and wife&mdash;bills, bills,
      and more bills. You&rsquo;ll say that you and she will economize and fight it
      out together. Fine, first-rate, but later on there may be more of you, a
      child, children perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, son. Such things do happen, and they cost money. More
      mouths to feed. Now I take it for granted that you aren&rsquo;t marryin&rsquo; the
      Fosdick girl for her money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interruption was prompt and made with fiery indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of her money,&rdquo; declared Albert. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know that
      she has any. If she has, I don&rsquo;t want it. I wouldn&rsquo;t take it. She is all I
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes&rsquo; lip twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judgin&rsquo; from the tone of her ma&rsquo;s last letter to me,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;she
      is all you would be liable to get. It don&rsquo;t read as if many&mdash;er&mdash;weddin&rsquo; 
      presents from the bride&rsquo;s folks would come along with her. But, there,
      there, Al don&rsquo;t get mad. I know this is a long ways from bein&rsquo; a joke to
      you and, in a way, it&rsquo;s no joke for me. Course I had realized that some
      day you&rsquo;d be figgerin&rsquo;, maybe, on gettin&rsquo; married, but I did hope the
      figgerin&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t begin for some years yet. And when you did, I rather
      hoped&mdash;well, I&mdash;I hoped. . . . However, we won&rsquo;t stop to bother
      with that now. Let&rsquo;s stick to this letter of Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s here. I must
      answer that, I suppose, whether I want to or not, to-day. Well, Al, you
      tell me, I understand that there has been nothin&rsquo; underhand in your
      acquaintance with her daughter. Other than keepin&rsquo; the engagement a
      secret, that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mean to stick by your guns and. . . . Well, what is it? Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been a knock upon the office door. In answer to his employer&rsquo;s
      summons, Mr. Keeler appeared. He held a card in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, I be, yes, sir. But I
      judged maybe &lsquo;twas somethin&rsquo; important about the lumber for his house and
      he seemed anxious to see you, so I took the risk and knocked. Um-hm&mdash;yes,
      yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes looked at the card. Then he adjusted his spectacles and
      looked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Humph! . . . We-ell, Labe, I guess likely you might
      show him in here. Wait just a minute before you do it, though. I&rsquo;ll open
      the door when I want him to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;n Lote. Yes, yes,&rdquo; observed Mr. Keeler and departed. The
      captain looked thoughtfully at the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to cut this talk
      of ours short for a little spell. You go back to your desk and wait there
      until I call you. Hold on,&rdquo; as his grandson moved toward the door of the
      outer office. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go that way. Go out through the side door into the
      yard and come in the front way. There&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;there&rsquo;s a man
      waitin&rsquo; to see me, and&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps he&rsquo;d better not see you
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert stared at him uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not see ME?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes handed the card to Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better let me talk with him first, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can have your
      chance later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The card bore the name of Mr. Fletcher Story Fosdick.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Albert read the name on the card. He was too astonished to speak. Her
      father! He was here! He&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather spoke again, and his tone was brisk and businesslike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Al,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Out through this side door and around to the
      front. Lively, son, lively!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the young man&rsquo;s wits were returning. He scowled at the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said stoutly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to run away. I&rsquo;m not afraid of him.
      I haven&rsquo;t done anything to be ashamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded. &ldquo;If you had, I should ASK you to run away,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;As it is, I just ask you to step out and wait a little while, that&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Grandfather, I WANT to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I want you to&mdash;but not until he and I have talked first.
      Come, boy, come! I&rsquo;ve lived a little longer than you have, and maybe I
      know about half as much about some things. This is one of &lsquo;em. You clear
      out and stand by. I&rsquo;ll call you when I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert went, but reluctantly. After he had gone his grandfather walked to
      the door of the outer office and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step aboard, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come in, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fosdick was a large man, portly, and with a head which was
      rapidly losing its thatch. His smoot-shaven face was ruddy and his blue
      eye mild. He entered the private office of Z. Snow and Co. and shook the
      hand which Captain Zelotes proffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Captain Snow?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly. &ldquo;You and I have had
      some business dealings, but we have never met before, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain waved toward a chair. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we ever have, but it&rsquo;s better late than by and by, as the
      feller said. Sit down, sit down, Mr. Fosdick. Throw off your coat, won&rsquo;t
      you? It&rsquo;s sort of warm in here compared to out door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor admitted the difference in temperature between the interior
      and exterior of the building, and removed his overcoat. Also he sat down.
      Captain Zelotes opened a drawer of his desk and produced a box of cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a smoke, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fosdick glanced at the label on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I was rather hoping you would smoke one of mine,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I have a pocket full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I come callin&rsquo; on you at your place in New York I will smoke yours.
      Now it kind of looks to me as if you&rsquo;d ought to smoke mine. Seems
      reasonable when you think it over, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick smiled. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. He took one of the
      gaudily banded perfectos from his host&rsquo;s box and accepted a light from the
      match the captain held. Both men blew a cloud of smoke and through those
      clouds each looked at the other. The preliminaries were over, but neither
      seemed particularly anxious to begin the real conversation. It was the
      visitor who, at last, began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Snow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I presume your clerk told you I wished to see
      you on a matter of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Oh, Labe, you mean? Yes, he told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him to tell you that. It may surprise you, however, to learn that
      the business I wished to see you about&mdash;that I came on from New York
      to see you about&mdash;has nothing whatever to do with the house I&rsquo;m
      building down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes removed his cigar from his lips and looked meditatively at
      its burning end. &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;that don&rsquo;t surprise me very
      much. I cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t about the house you wished to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see! . . . Humph!&rdquo; The Fosdick mild blue eye lost, for the moment,
      just a trifle of its mildness and became almost keen, as its owner flashed
      a glance at the big figure seated at the desk. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Fosdick.
      &ldquo;And have you&mdash;er&mdash;guessed what I did come to see you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. I wouldn&rsquo;t call it guessin&rsquo;, exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you? What would you call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ll, I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;d risk callin&rsquo; it knowin&rsquo;. Yes, I think likely
      I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. . . . Humph! Have you had a letter&mdash;on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. From Mrs. Fosdick, of course. She said she was going to write&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not sure she didn&rsquo;t say she had written; but I had the impression it was
      to&mdash;well, to another member of your family, Captain Snow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, &lsquo;twas to me. Come this mornin&rsquo;s mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. My mistake. Well, I&rsquo;m obliged to her in a way. If the news has
      been broken to you, I shan&rsquo;t have to break it and we can get down to brass
      tacks just so much sooner. The surprise being over&mdash;I take it, it WAS
      a surprise, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take it right. Just as much of a surprise to me as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Well, the surprise being over for both of us, we can talk of
      the affair&mdash;calmly and coolly. What do you think about it, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know as I know exactly what to think. What do YOU think about
      it, Mr. Fosdick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;I imagine I think very much as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. And&mdash;er&mdash;what&rsquo;s your notion of what I
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes&rsquo; gray eye twinkled as he asked the question, and the
      Fosdick blue eye twinkled in return. Both men laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t getting very far this way, Captain,&rdquo; observed the visitor.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use dodging, I suppose. I, for one, am not very well pleased.
      Mrs. Fosdick, for another, isn&rsquo;t pleased at all; she is absolutely and
      entirely opposed to the whole affair. She won&rsquo;t hear of it, that&rsquo;s all,
      and she said so much that I thought perhaps I had better come down here at
      once, see you, and&mdash;and the young fellow with the queer name&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes. He is your grandson, isn&rsquo;t he? I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I shan&rsquo;t fight with you because you don&rsquo;t like his
      name. Go ahead. You decided to come and see him&mdash;and me&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. I decided to come because it has been my experience that a
      frank, straight talk is better, in cases like this, than a hundred
      letters. And that the time to talk was now, before matters between the
      young foo&mdash;the young people went any further. Don&rsquo;t you agree with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That now is a good time to talk? Yes, I do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then suppose we talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another interval of silence. Then Fosdick broke it with a
      chuckle. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m the one to do the talking, eh?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote&rsquo;s eye twinkled. &ldquo;We-ll, you came all the way from New York on
      purpose, you know,&rdquo; he observed. Then he added: &ldquo;But there, Mr. Fosdick, I
      don&rsquo;t want you to think I ain&rsquo;t polite or won&rsquo;t talk, myself. I&rsquo;ll do my
      share when the time comes. But it does seem to me that you ought to do
      yours first as it&rsquo;s your family so far that&rsquo;s done the objectin&rsquo;. . . .
      Your cigar&rsquo;s gone out. Have another light, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor shook his head. &ldquo;No, thank you, not now,&rdquo; he said hastily,
      placing the defunct cigar carefully on the captain&rsquo;s desk. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t smoke
      for the minute. So you want me to begin the talking, do you? It seems to
      me I have begun it. I told you that I do not like the idea of my
      daughter&rsquo;s being engaged to&mdash;to say nothing of marrying&mdash;your
      grandson. My wife likes it even less than I do. That is enough of a
      statement to begin with, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not exactly, if you&rsquo;ll excuse my sayin&rsquo; so. Your daughter
      herself&mdash;how does she feel about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is enthusiastic, naturally. She appears to be suffering from
      temporary insanity on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t seem to think it&rsquo;s quite as&mdash;er&mdash;preposterous, and
      ridiculous and outrageous&mdash;and Lord knows what all&mdash;as your wife
      does, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I say, Snow, I hope you&rsquo;re not too deeply offended by what my wife
      wrote you. I judge you are quoting from her letter and apparently she
      piled it on red-hot. You&rsquo;ll have to excuse her; she was almost wild all
      day yesterday. I&rsquo;ll ask your pardon on her behalf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho, sho! No need, Mr. Fosdick, no need at all. I know what women are,
      even the easy-goin&rsquo; kind, when they&rsquo;ve got steam up. I&rsquo;ve got a wife&mdash;and
      I had a daughter. But, gettin&rsquo; back on the course again, you think your
      daughter&rsquo;s crazy because she wants to marry my grandson. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that, exactly. Of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you see, you did say it. However, we&rsquo;ll leave that to one side for a
      spell. What objection&mdash;what real objection is there to those two
      marryin&rsquo;&mdash;my grandson and your daughter&mdash;provided that they care
      for each other as they&rsquo;d ought to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fosdick&rsquo;s expression changed slightly. His tone, as he replied to the
      question, was colder and his manner less cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it is worth while answering that in detail,&rdquo; he said,
      after an instant&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Frankly, Captain Snow, I had rather hoped you
      would see, for yourself, the reasons why such a marriage wouldn&rsquo;t be
      desirable. If you don&rsquo;t see them, if you are backing up your grandson in
      his business, why&mdash;well, there is no use in our discussing the matter
      any further, is there? We should only lose our tempers and not gain much.
      So we had better end it now, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet. Captain Zelotes, leaning forward, held up a
      protesting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;now, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to
      misunderstand me. And I&rsquo;m sorry if what I said has made you mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully. &ldquo;I make it a
      rule in all my business dealings not to get mad, or, more especially, not
      to let the other fellow know that I&rsquo;m getting that way. My temper hasn&rsquo;t a
      ruffle in it just now, and I am leaving merely because I want it to remain
      smooth. I judge that you and I aren&rsquo;t going to agree. All right, then
      we&rsquo;ll differ, but we&rsquo;ll differ without a fight, that&rsquo;s all. Good
      afternoon, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Lote&rsquo;s hand still remained uplifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just a minute now&mdash;just a minute. You never
      have met Albert, my grandson, have you? Never even seen him, maybe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I intend to meet him and talk with him before I leave South
      Harniss. He was one of the two people I came here to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was the other, eh? Um-hm. . . . I see. You think you&rsquo;ve found out
      where I stand and now you&rsquo;ll size him up. Honest, Mr. Fosdick, I . . .
      Humph! Mind if I tell you a little story? &lsquo;Twon&rsquo;t take long. When I was a
      little shaver, me and my granddad, the first Cap&rsquo;n Lote Snow&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      been two since&mdash;were great chums. When he was home from sea he and I
      stuck together like hot pitch and oakum. One day we were sittin&rsquo; out in
      the front yard of his house&mdash;it&rsquo;s mine, now&mdash;watchin&rsquo; a hoptoad
      catch flies. You&rsquo;ve seen a toad catch flies, haven&rsquo;t you, Mr. Fosdick? Mr.
      Toad sits there, lookin&rsquo; half asleep and as pious and demure as a
      pickpocket at camp-meetin&rsquo;, until a fly comes along and gets too near.
      Then, Zip! out shoots about six inches of toad tongue and that fly&rsquo;s been
      asked in to dinner. Well, granddad and I sat lookin&rsquo; at our particular
      toad when along came a bumble-bee and lighted on a honeysuckle blossom
      right in front of the critter. The toad didn&rsquo;t take time to think it over,
      all he saw was a square meal, and his tongue flashed out and nailed that
      bumble-bee and snapped it into the pantry. In about a half second, though,
      there was a change. The pantry had been emptied, the bumble-bee was on his
      way again, and Mr. Toad was on his, hoppin&rsquo; lively and huntin&rsquo; for&mdash;well,
      for ice water or somethin&rsquo; coolin&rsquo;, I guess likely. Granddad tapped me on
      the shoulder. &lsquo;Sonny,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a lesson for you. That hoptoad
      didn&rsquo;t wait to make sure that bumble-bee was good to eat; he took it for
      granted, and was sorry afterward. It don&rsquo;t pay to jump at conclusions,
      son,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Some conclusions are like that bumble-bee&rsquo;s, they have
      stings in &lsquo;em.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote, having finished his story, felt in his pocket for a match.
      Fosdick, for an instant, appeared puzzled. Then he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You think I made too quick a jump when I concluded you
      were backing your grandson in this affair. All right, I&rsquo;m glad to hear it.
      What do you want me to do, sit down again and listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resumed his seat as he asked the question. Captain Zelotes nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You see, you misunderstood me, Mr.
      Fosdick. I didn&rsquo;t mean any more than what I said when I asked you what
      real objection there was, in your opinion to Albert&rsquo;s marryin&rsquo; your&mdash;er&mdash;Madeline,
      that&rsquo;s her name, I believe. Seems to me the way for us to get to an
      understandin&rsquo;&mdash;you and I&mdash;is to find out just how the situation
      looks to each of us. When we&rsquo;ve found out that, we&rsquo;ll know how nigh we
      come to agreein&rsquo; or disagreein&rsquo; and can act accordin&rsquo;. Sounds reasonable,
      don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick nodded in his turn. &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Well, ask your
      questions, and I&rsquo;ll answer them. After that perhaps I&rsquo;ll ask some myself.
      Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have gone ahead. I&rsquo;ve asked one already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is such a general question. There may be so many objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. All right, then I&rsquo;ll ask some: What do the lawyers call &lsquo;em?&mdash;Atlantic?
      Pacific? I&rsquo;ve got it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask some specific questions. Here&rsquo;s one.
      Do you object to Al personally? To his character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. We know nothing about his character. Very likely he may be a
      young saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he ain&rsquo;t, so we&rsquo;ll let that slide. He&rsquo;s a good boy, though, so far
      as I&rsquo;ve ever been able to find out. Is it his looks? You&rsquo;ve never seen
      him, but your wife has. Don&rsquo;t she like his looks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t mentioned his looks to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it his money? He hasn&rsquo;t got any of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell, of course that does count a little bit. Madeline is our only
      child, and naturally we should prefer to have her pick out a husband with
      a dollar or so in reserve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Al&rsquo;s twenty-one, Mr. Fosdick. When I was twenty-one I had some put
      by, but not much. I presume likely &lsquo;twas different with you, maybe.
      Probably you were pretty well fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick laughed aloud. &ldquo;You make a good cross-examiner, Snow,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, when I was twenty-one I was assistant
      bookkeeper in a New Haven broker&rsquo;s office. I didn&rsquo;t have a cent except my
      salary, and I had that only for the first five days in the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, you got married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. More fool I! If I had known anything, I should have waited
      five years at least. I didn&rsquo;t have any one to tell me so. My father and
      mother were both dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you&rsquo;d have listened to &lsquo;em if they had been alive and had told you?
      However, however, that&rsquo;s all to one side. Well, Albert&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; no money
      to speak of is an objection&mdash;and a good honest one from your point of
      view. His prospects here in this business of mine are fair, and he is
      doin&rsquo; better at it than he was, so he may make a comf&rsquo;table livin&rsquo;&mdash;a
      comf&rsquo;table South Harniss livin&rsquo;, that is&mdash;by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is with you, then? Oh, yes, I remember my wife said he worked in
      your office. But she said more about his being some sort of a&mdash;a
      poet, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since the interview began the captain looked ill at
      ease and embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunderation!&rdquo; he exclaimed testily, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t pay attention to that.
      He does make up poetry&rsquo; pieces&mdash;er&mdash;on the side, as you might
      say, but I keep hopin&rsquo; all the time he&rsquo;ll grow out of it, give him time.
      It &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t his regular job, you mustn&rsquo;t think &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor laughed again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;both for your
      sake and mine. I judge that you and I, Snow, are in complete agreement as
      far as our opinion of poetry and that sort of stuff is concerned. Of
      course I&rsquo;m not condemning all poetry, you understand. Longfellow and
      Tennyson and the regular poets are all right. You understand what I&rsquo;m
      getting at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. I used to know &lsquo;Down went the R&rsquo;yal George with all her crew
      complete,&rsquo; and a lot more. Used to say &lsquo;em over to myself when I first
      went to sea and stood watch alone nights. But they were different, you
      know; they&mdash;they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! My wife&mdash;why, I give you my word that my own wife and her set
      go perfectly daffy over chaps who write stuff that rhymes and that the
      papers are printing columns about. Snow, if this grandson of yours was a
      genuine press-touted, women&rsquo;s club poet instead of a would-be&mdash;well,
      I don&rsquo;t know what might happen. In that case she might be as strong FOR
      this engagement as she is now against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, seeming a bit ashamed of his own heat. Captain Zelotes,
      however, regarded him with more approval than he had yet shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my observation that women are likely to get off the course
      chasin&rsquo; false signals like that,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;When a man begins lettin&rsquo; 
      his hair and his mouth run wild together seems as if the combination had
      an attraction for a good many women folks. Al keeps his hair cut, though,
      I&rsquo;ll say that for him,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It curls some, but it ain&rsquo;t long. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have him in the office if &lsquo;twas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what other objections are they?
      Manners? Family and relations? Education? Any objections along that line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, no; I&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know; you see, I don&rsquo;t know much about
      the young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can help you out. As to manners&mdash;well, you can judge them
      for yourself when you see him. He seems to be in about every kind of
      social doin&rsquo;s there is down here, and he&rsquo;s as much or more popular with
      the summer folks than with the year-&rsquo;rounders. Education? Well, that&rsquo;s
      fair to middlin&rsquo;, as I see it. He spent nine or ten years in a mighty
      expensive boardin&rsquo; school up in New York State.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? What school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave the name of the school. Fosdick looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! That IS a good school,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? Depends on what you call good, I cal&rsquo;late. Al learned a good deal
      of this and that, a little bit of foreign language, some that they call
      dead and some that ought to be dead&mdash;and buried, &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to my
      notion. When he came to me he couldn&rsquo;t add up a column of ten figgers
      without makin&rsquo; a mistake, and as for business&mdash;well, what he knew
      about business was about equal to what Noah knew about a gas engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to chuckle, and Fosdick chuckled with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to family,&rdquo; went on Captain Lote, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a Snow on his mother&rsquo;s side,
      and there&rsquo;s been seven generations of Snow&rsquo;s in this part of the Cape
      since the first one landed here. So far as I know, they&rsquo;ve all managed to
      keep out of jail, which may have been more good luck than deservin&rsquo; in
      some cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father?&rdquo; queried Fosdick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s heavy brows drew together. &ldquo;His father was a Portygee&mdash;or
      Spaniard, I believe is right&mdash;and he was a play-actor, one of those&mdash;what
      do you call &lsquo;em?&mdash;opera singers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick seemed surprised and interested. &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;an
      opera singer? . . . Why, he wasn&rsquo;t Speranza, the baritone, was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe; I believe he was. He married my daughter and&mdash;well, we won&rsquo;t
      talk about him, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Speranza was a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;IF you don&rsquo;t mind, Mr. Fosdick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote lapsed into silence, drumming the desk with his big fingers.
      His visitor waited for a few moments. At length he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Snow, I have answered your questions and you have answered
      mine. Do you think we are any nearer an agreement now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes seemed to awake with a start. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he queried.
      &ldquo;Agreement? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Did you find any&mdash;er&mdash;what you
      might call vital objections in the boy&rsquo;s record?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o. No, all that is all right. His family and his education and all the
      rest are good enough, I&rsquo;m sure. But, nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still object to the young folks gettin&rsquo; married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. Hang it all, Snow, this isn&rsquo;t a thing one can reason out,
      exactly. Madeline is our only child; she is our pet, our baby. Naturally
      her mother and I have planned for her, hoped for her, figured that some
      day, when we had to give her up, it would be to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To somebody that wasn&rsquo;t Albert Speranza of South Harniss, Mass. . . .
      Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Not that your grandson isn&rsquo;t all right. I have no doubt he is a
      tip-top young fellow. But, you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote suddenly leaned forward. &ldquo;Course I see, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he
      interrupted. &ldquo;Course I see. You object, and the objection ain&rsquo;t a mite
      weaker on account of your not bein&rsquo; able to say exactly what &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea. Thank you, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. I can understand. I know just how you feel, because I&rsquo;ve
      been feelin&rsquo; the same way myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have? Good! Then you can sympathize with Mrs. Fosdick and with
      me. You see&mdash;you understand why we had rather our daughter did not
      marry your grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. You see, I&rsquo;ve had just the same sort of general kind of objection
      to Al&rsquo;s marryin&rsquo; your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher Fosdick leaned slowly backward in his chair. His appearance
      was suggestive of one who has received an unexpected thump between the
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have!&rdquo; he said again, but not with the same expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm,&rdquo; said Captain Zelotes gravely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like you in one way; I&rsquo;ve
      never met your Madeline any more than you have met Al. I&rsquo;ve seen her once
      or twice, and she is real pretty and nice-lookin&rsquo;. But I don&rsquo;t know her at
      all. Now I don&rsquo;t doubt for a minute but that she&rsquo;s a real nice girl and it
      might be that she&rsquo;d make Al a fairly good wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;well,&mdash;thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, I mean it. It might be she would. And I ain&rsquo;t got a
      thing against you or your folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&mdash;er&mdash;thanks again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right; you don&rsquo;t need to thank me. But it&rsquo;s this way with me&mdash;I
      live in South Harniss all the year round. I want to live here till I die,
      and&mdash;after I die I&rsquo;d like first-rate to have Al take up the Z. Snow
      and Co. business and the Snow house and land and keep them goin&rsquo; till HE
      dies. Mind, I ain&rsquo;t at all sure that he&rsquo;ll do it, or be capable of doin&rsquo; 
      it, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like. Now you&rsquo;re in New York most of the year, and
      so&rsquo;s your wife and daughter. New York is all right&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; a
      word against it&mdash;but New York and South Harniss are different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Fosdick lip twitched. &ldquo;Somewhat different,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. That sounds like a joke, I know; but I don&rsquo;t mean it so, not now.
      What I mean is that I know South Harniss and South Harniss folks. I don&rsquo;t
      know New York&mdash;not so very well, though I&rsquo;ve been there plenty of
      times&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know New York ways. But I do know South Harniss
      ways, and they suit me. Would they suit your daughter&mdash;not just for
      summer, but as a reg&rsquo;lar thing right straight along year in and out? I
      doubt it, Mr. Fosdick, I doubt it consid&rsquo;able. Course I don&rsquo;t know your
      daughter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;and I share your doubts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. But whether she liked it or not she&rsquo;d have to come here if she
      married my grandson. Either that or he&rsquo;d have to go to New York. And if he
      went to New York, how would he earn his livin&rsquo;? Get a new bookkeepin&rsquo; job
      and start all over again, or live on poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fosdick opened his mouth as if to speak, seemed to change his mind and
      closed it again, without speaking. Captain Zelotes, looking keenly at him,
      seemed to guess his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said deliberately, but with a firmness which permitted no
      misunderstanding of his meaning, &ldquo;of course you mustn&rsquo;t get it into your
      head for one minute that the boy is figgerin&rsquo; on your daughter&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; a
      rich girl. He hasn&rsquo;t given that a thought. You take my word for that, Mr.
      Fosdick. He doesn&rsquo;t know how much money she or you have got and he doesn&rsquo;t
      care. He doesn&rsquo;t care a continental darn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor smiled slightly. &ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; he began. The captain
      interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t any nevertheless,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Albert has been with me
      enough years now so that I know a little about him. And I know that all he
      wants is your daughter. As to how much she&rsquo;s worth in money or how they&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to live after he&rsquo;s got her&mdash;I know that he hasn&rsquo;t given it one
      thought. I don&rsquo;t imagine she has, either. For one reason,&rdquo; he added, with
      a smile, &ldquo;he is too poor a business man to think of marriage as a
      business, bill-payin&rsquo; contract, and for another,&mdash;for another&mdash;why,
      good Lord, Fosdick!&rdquo; he exclaimed, leaning forward, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know what
      this thing means to those two young folks? It means just moonshine and
      mush and lookin&rsquo; into each other&rsquo;s eyes, that&rsquo;s about all. THEY haven&rsquo;t
      thought any practical thoughts about it. Why, think what their ages are!
      Think of yourself at that age! Can&rsquo;t you remember. . . . Humph! Well, I&rsquo;m
      talkin&rsquo; fifty revolutions to the second. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Snow. And I believe you have the situation sized up as
      it is. Still&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Fosdick, but don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s about time you had a
      look at the boy himself? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask him to come in here and meet
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick looked troubled. &ldquo;Think it is good policy?&rdquo; he asked doubtfully.
      &ldquo;I want to see him and speak with him, but I do hate a scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be any scene. You just meet him face to face and talk enough
      with him to get a little idea of what your first impression is. Don&rsquo;t
      contradict or commit yourself or anything. And I&rsquo;ll send him out at the
      end of two or three minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for a reply, he rose, opened the door to the outer office
      and called, &ldquo;Al, come in here!&rdquo; When Albert had obeyed the order he closed
      the door behind him and turning to the gentleman in the visitor&rsquo;s chair,
      said: &ldquo;Mr. Fosdick, this is my grandson, Albert Speranza. Al, shake hands
      with Mr. Fosdick from New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While awaiting the summons to meet the father of his adored, Albert had
      been rehearsing and re-rehearsing the speeches he intended making when
      that meeting took place. Sitting at his desk, pen in hand and pretending
      to be busy with the bookkeeping of Z. Snow and Company, he had seen, not
      the ruled page of the day book, but the parental countenance of the
      Honorable Fletcher Fosdick. And, to his mind&rsquo;s eye, that countenance was
      as rugged and stern as the rock-bound coast upon which the Pilgrims
      landed, and about as unyielding and impregnable as the door of the office
      safe. So, when his grandfather called him, he descended from the tall desk
      stool and crossed the threshold of the inner room, a trifle pale, a little
      shaky at the knees, but with the set chin and erect head of one who,
      facing almost hopeless odds, intends fighting to the last gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment the Fosdick countenance was not as his imagination had
      pictured it. The blue eyes met his, not with a glare or a glower, but with
      a look of interest and inquiry. The Fosdick hand shook his with
      politeness, and the Fosdick manner was, if not genial, at least quiet and
      matter of fact. He was taken aback. What did it mean? Was it possible that
      Madeline&rsquo;s father was inclined to regard her engagement to him with favor?
      A great throb of joy accompanied the thought. Then he remembered the
      letter he had just read, the letter from Madeline&rsquo;s mother, and the hope
      subsided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; said Captain Zelotes, &ldquo;Mr. Fosdick has come on here to talk with
      us; that is, with me and you, about your affairs. He and I have talked up
      to the point where it seemed to me you ought to come in for a spell. I&rsquo;ve
      told him that the news that you and his daughter were&mdash;er&mdash;favorably
      disposed toward each other was as sudden and as big a surprise to me as
      &lsquo;twas to him. Even your grandma don&rsquo;t know it yet. Now I presume likely
      he&rsquo;d like to ask you a few questions. Heave ahead, Mr. Fosdick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He relit his cigar stump and leaned back in his chair. Mr. Fosdick leaned
      forward in his. Albert stood very straight, his shoulders braced for the
      encounter. The quizzical twinkle shone in Captain Lote&rsquo;s eye as he
      regarded his grandson. Fosdick also smiled momentarily as he caught the
      expression of the youth&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Speranza,&rdquo; he began, in so cheerful a tone that Albert&rsquo;s
      astonishment grew even greater, &ldquo;your grandfather has been kind enough to
      get us through the preliminaries, so we&rsquo;ll come at once to the essentials.
      You and my daughter consider yourselves engaged to marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. We ARE engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. How long have you&mdash;um&mdash;been that way, so to speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since last August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you said anything about it to us&mdash;to Mrs. Fosdick or me
      or your people here? You must excuse these personal questions. As I have
      just said to Captain Snow, Madeline is our only child, and her happiness
      and welfare mean about all there is in life to her mother and me. So,
      naturally, the man she is going to marry is an important consideration.
      You and I have never met before, so the quickest way of reaching an
      understanding between us is by the question route. You get my meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I guess I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then we&rsquo;ll go ahead. Why have you two kept it a secret so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well, because we knew we couldn&rsquo;t marry yet a while, so we
      thought we had better not announce it for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! . . . And the idea that perhaps Mrs. Fosdick and I might be slightly
      interested didn&rsquo;t occur to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir, it did. But,&mdash;but we thought it best not to tell you
      until later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the suspicion that we might not be overjoyed by the news had a
      little weight with you, eh? Possibly that helped to delay the&mdash;er&mdash;announcement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you! Perhaps you thought we WOULD be overjoyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. We didn&rsquo;t think so very much about it. Well, that&rsquo;s not quite
      true. Madeline felt that her mother&mdash;and you, too, sir, I suppose,
      although she didn&rsquo;t speak as often of you in that way&mdash;she felt that
      her mother would disapprove at first, and so we had better wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until&mdash;until by and by. Until I had gone ahead further, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do know. Gone ahead how? Until you had a better
      position, more salary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly. Until my writings were better known. Until I was a
      little more successful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Successful? Until you wrote more poetry, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Poetry and other things, stories and plays, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;Did you figure that you and Madeline were to live on
      what you made by writing poetry and the other stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick looked across at Captain Zelotes. The Captain&rsquo;s face was worth
      looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here, hold on!&rdquo; he exclaimed, jumping into the conversation. &ldquo;Al,
      what are you talkin&rsquo; about? You&rsquo;re bookkeeper for me, ain&rsquo;t you; for this
      concern right here where you are? What do you mean by talkin&rsquo; as if your
      job was makin&rsquo; up poetry pieces? That&rsquo;s only what you do on the side, and
      you know it. Eh, ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert hesitated. He had, momentarily, forgotten his grandfather and the
      latter&rsquo;s prejudices. After all, what was the use of stirring up additional
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it&rsquo;s so. It&rsquo;s in this office that you draw your wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Excuse me for nosin&rsquo; in, Mr. Fosdick, but I knew the boy
      wasn&rsquo;t puttin&rsquo; the thing as plain as it ought to be, and I didn&rsquo;t want you
      to get the wrong notion. Heave ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick smiled slightly. &ldquo;All right, Captain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I get it, I
      think. Well, then,&rdquo; turning again to Albert, &ldquo;your plan for supporting my
      daughter was to wait until your position here, plus the poetry, should
      bring in sufficient revenue. It didn&rsquo;t occur to you that&mdash;well, that
      there might be a possibility of getting money&mdash;elsewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert plainly did not understand, but it was just as plain that his
      grandfather did. Captain Zelotes spoke sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I just answered that question for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. But if you were in my place you might like to have him
      answer it. I don&rsquo;t mean to be offensive, but business is business, and,
      after all, this is a business talk. So&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain interrupted. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ll talk it in a business way, eh?&rdquo; he
      snapped. &ldquo;All right. Al, what Mr. Fosdick means is had you cal&rsquo;lated that,
      if you married his daughter, maybe her dad&rsquo;s money might help you and her
      to keep goin&rsquo;? To put it even plainer: had you planned some on her bein&rsquo; a
      rich girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick looked annoyed. &ldquo;Oh, I say, Snow!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too strong,
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mite. It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve had in the back of your head all along. I&rsquo;m
      just helpin&rsquo; it to come out of the front. Well, Al?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The red spots were burning in the Speranza cheeks. He choked as he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;Of course I haven&rsquo;t planned on any such thing. I
      don&rsquo;t know how rich she is. I don&rsquo;t care. I wish she was as poor as&mdash;as
      I am. I want HER, that&rsquo;s all. And she wants me. We don&rsquo;t either of us care
      about money. I wouldn&rsquo;t take a cent of your money, Mr. Fosdick. But I&mdash;I
      want Madeline and&mdash;and&mdash;I shall have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of her parents, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. . . . I&rsquo;m sorry to speak so, Mr. Fosdick, but it is true. We&mdash;we
      love each other. We&mdash;we&rsquo;ve agreed to wait for each other, no matter&mdash;no
      matter if it is years and years. And as for the money and all that, if you
      disinherit her, or&mdash;or whatever it is they do&mdash;we don&rsquo;t care. I&mdash;I
      hope you will. I&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes&rsquo; voice broke in upon the impassioned outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Al; steady, son,&rdquo; he cautioned quietly. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ve said
      enough. I don&rsquo;t think any more&rsquo;s necessary. You&rsquo;d better go back to your
      desk now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Grandfather, I want him to understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess likely he does. I should say you&rsquo;d made it real plain. Go now,
      Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned, but, with a shaking hand upon the doorknob, turned back
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Fosdick,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
      mean to say anything to hurt your feelings. But&mdash;but, you see,
      Madeline&mdash;she and I&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not go on. Fosdick&rsquo;s nod and answer were not unkindly. &ldquo;All
      right, Speranza,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not offended. Hope I wasn&rsquo;t too blunt,
      myself. Good-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed behind the young man he turned to Captain Lote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry if I offended you, Snow,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I threw in that hint about
      marrying just to see what effect it would have, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. So I judged. Well, you saw, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. Say, Captain, except as a prospective son-in-law, and then only
      because I don&rsquo;t see him in that light&mdash;I rather like that grandson of
      yours. He&rsquo;s a fine, upstanding young chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain made no reply. He merely pulled at his beard. However, he did
      not look displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a handsome specimen, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; went on Fosdick. &ldquo;No wonder Madeline
      fell for his looks. Those and the poetry together are a combination hard
      to resist&mdash;at her age. And he&rsquo;s a gentleman. He handled himself
      mighty well while I was stringing him just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beard tugging continued. &ldquo;Um-hm,&rdquo; observed Captain Zelotes dryly; &ldquo;he
      does pretty well for a&mdash;South Harniss gentleman. But we&rsquo;re kind of
      wastin&rsquo; time, ain&rsquo;t we, Mr. Fosdick? In spite of his looks and his manners
      and all the rest, now that you&rsquo;ve seen him you still object to that
      engagement, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I do. The boy is all right, I&rsquo;m sure, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, I understand. I feel the same way about your girl. She&rsquo;s all
      right, I&rsquo;m sure, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re agreed on everything, includin&rsquo; the &lsquo;but.&rsquo; And the &lsquo;but&rsquo; is that
      New York is one place and South Harniss is another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em to marry. Fine. First rate! Only now we come to the
      most important &lsquo;but&rsquo; of all. What are we going to do about it? Suppose we
      say no and they say yes and keep on sayin&rsquo; it? Suppose they decide to get
      married no matter what we say. How are we goin&rsquo; to stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor regarded him for a moment and then broke into a hearty laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all right. You surely have the faculty of
      putting your finger on the weak spots. Of course we can&rsquo;t stop it. If
      these two young idiots have a mind to marry and keep that mind, they WILL
      marry and we can&rsquo;t prevent it any more than we could prevent the tide
      coming in to-morrow morning. <i>I</i> realized that this was a sort of
      fool&rsquo;s errand, my coming down here. I know that this isn&rsquo;t the age when
      parents can forbid marriages and get away with it, as they used to on the
      stage in the old plays. Boys and girls nowadays have a way of going their
      own gait in such matters. But my wife doesn&rsquo;t see it in exactly that way,
      and she was so insistent on my coming down here to stop the thing if I
      could that&mdash;well, I came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did, Mr. Fosdick, real glad. And, although I agree with you
      that the very worst thing to do, if we want to stop this team from pullin&rsquo; 
      together, is to haul back on the bits and holler &lsquo;Whoa,&rsquo; still I&rsquo;m kind of
      hopeful that, maybe . . . humph! I declare, it looks as if I&rsquo;d have to
      tell you another story. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; as bad as Cap&rsquo;n Hannibal Doane used to
      be, and they used to call him &lsquo;The Rope Walk&rsquo; &lsquo;cause he spun so many
      yarns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick laughed again. &ldquo;You may go as far as you like with your stories,
      Captain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can grow fat on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Well, this ain&rsquo;t a story exactly; it just kind of makes the point
      I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to get at. Calvin Bangs had a white mare one time and the
      critter had a habit of runnin&rsquo; away. Once his wife, Hannah J., was in the
      buggy all by herself, over to the Ostable Fair, Calvin havin&rsquo; got out to
      buy some peanuts or somethin&rsquo;. The mare got scared of the noise and crowd
      and bolted. As luck would have it, she went right through the fence and
      out onto the trottin&rsquo; track. And around that track she went, hell bent for
      election. All hands was runnin&rsquo; alongside hollerin&rsquo; &lsquo;Stop her! Stop her!
      &lsquo;but not Calvin&mdash;no SIR! He waited till the mare was abreast of him,
      the mare on two legs and the buggy on two wheels and Hannah &lsquo;most
      anywheres between the dasher and the next world, and then he sung out:
      &lsquo;Give her her head, Hannah! Give her her head. She&rsquo;ll stop when she runs
      down.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and his visitor laughed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather,&rdquo; observed the New Yorker, &ldquo;that you believe it the better
      policy to give our young people their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In reason&mdash;yes, I do. It&rsquo;s my judgment that an affair like this will
      hurry more and more if you try too hard to stop it. If you don&rsquo;t try at
      all so any one would notice it, it may run down and stop of itself, the
      way Calvin&rsquo;s mare did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick nodded reflectively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with you,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;But does that mean that they&rsquo;re to correspond, write love letters, and
      all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in reason, maybe. If we say no to that, they&rsquo;ll write anyhow, won&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. . . . How would it do to get them to promise to write nothing
      that their parents might not see? Of course I don&rsquo;t mean for your grandson
      to show you his letters before he sends them to Madeline. He&rsquo;s too old for
      that, and he would refuse. But suppose you asked him to agree to write
      nothing that Madeline would not be willing to show her mother&mdash;or me.
      Do you think he would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. I&rsquo;ll ask him. . . . Yes, I guess likely he&rsquo;d do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reason for suggesting it is, frankly, not so much on account of the
      young people as to pacify my wife. I am not afraid&mdash;not very much
      afraid of this love affair. They are young, both of them. Give them time,
      and&mdash;as you say, Snow, the thing may run down, peter out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in hopes &lsquo;twill. It&rsquo;s calf love, as I see it, and I believe &lsquo;twill
      pay to give the calves rope enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. No, I&rsquo;m not much troubled about the young people. But Mrs.
      Fosdick&mdash;well, my trouble will be with her. She&rsquo;ll want to have your
      boy shot or jailed or hanged or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume likely. I guess you&rsquo;ll have to handle her the way another
      feller who used to live here in South Harniss said he handled his wife.
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t never have any trouble at all,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Whenever she says yes
      or no, I say the same thing. Later on, when it comes to doin&rsquo;, I do what I
      feel like.&rsquo; . . . Eh? You&rsquo;re not goin&rsquo;, are you, Mr. Fosdick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor had risen and was reaching for his coat. Captain Zelotes also
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry, don&rsquo;t hurry,&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, but I must. I want to be back in New York tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t, can you? To do that you&rsquo;ll have to get up to Boston or
      Fall River, and the afternoon train&rsquo;s gone. You&rsquo;d better stay and have
      supper along with my wife and me, stay at our house over night, and take
      the early train after breakfast to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could; I&rsquo;d like nothing better. But I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo; Then, with a smile, he added: &ldquo;Al needn&rsquo;t eat with us, you know,
      if his bein&rsquo; there makes either of you feel nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick laughed again. &ldquo;I think I should be willing to risk the
      nervousness,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But I must go, really. I&rsquo;ve hired a chap at the
      garage here to drive me to Boston in his car and I&rsquo;ll take the midnight
      train over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, if you must, you must. Hope you have a comf&rsquo;table trip, Mr.
      Fosdick. Better wrap up warm; it&rsquo;s pretty nigh a five-hour run to Boston
      and there&rsquo;s some cool wind over the Ostable marshes this time of year.
      Good-by, sir. Glad to have had this talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor held out his hand. &ldquo;So am I, Snow,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;Mighty
      glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I wasn&rsquo;t too short and brisk at the beginnin&rsquo;. You see, I&rsquo;d just
      read your wife&rsquo;s letter, and&mdash;er&mdash;well, of course, I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;just&mdash;you
      see, you and I had never met, and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, certainly. I quite understand. And, fool&rsquo;s errand or not, I&rsquo;m
      very glad I came here. If you&rsquo;ll pardon my saying so, it was worth the
      trip to get acquainted with you. I hope, whatever comes of the other
      thing, that our acquaintanceship will continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here, same here. Go right out the side door, Mr. Fosdick, saves
      goin&rsquo; through the office. Good day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched the bulky figure of the New York banker tramping across the
      yard between the piles of lumber. A moment later he entered the outer
      office. Albert and Keeler were at their desks. Captain Zelotes approached
      the little bookkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labe,&rdquo; he queried, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t anything particular you want me to talk
      about just now, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lahan looked up in surprise from his figuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, no, Cap&rsquo;n Lote, don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s there is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      know&rsquo;s there is, not now, no, no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His employer nodded. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; back inside
      there and sit down and rest my chin for an hour, anyhow. I&rsquo;ve talked so
      much to-day that my jaws squeak. Don&rsquo;t disturb me for anything short of a
      fire or a mutiny.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was not disturbed and that evening, after supper was over, he was ready
      to talk again. He and Albert sat together in the sitting room&mdash;Mrs.
      Snow and Rachel were in the kitchen washing dishes&mdash;and Captain
      Zelotes told his grandson as much as he thought advisable to tell of his
      conversation with the Honorable Fletcher Fosdick. At first Albert was
      inclined to rebel at the idea of permitting his letters to Madeline to be
      read by the latter&rsquo;s parents, but at length he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it because it may make it easier for her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have
      a dreadful time, I suppose, with that unreasonable mother of hers. But, by
      George, Grandfather,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she splendid, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Mrs. Fosdick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;Madeline. Isn&rsquo;t she splendid and fine
      and loyal! I want you to know her, Grandfather, you and Grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Well, we&rsquo;ll hope to, some day. Now, son, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask for
      another promise. It may seem a hard one to make, but I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you to
      make it. I want you to give me your word that, no matter what happens or
      how long you have to wait, you and Madeline won&rsquo;t get married without
      tellin&rsquo; her folks and yours beforehand. You won&rsquo;t run away and marry. Will
      you promise me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at him. This WAS a hard promise to make. In their talks
      beneath the rainbows, whenever he and Madeline had referred to the future
      and its doubts, they had always pushed those doubts aside with vague hints
      of an elopement. If the unreasonableness of parents and grandparents
      should crowd them too far, they had always as a last resort, the solution
      of their problem by way of a runaway marriage. And now Captain Zelotes was
      asking him to give up this last resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, watching him keenly, divined what was in his grandson&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it over, Al,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer me now, but think it
      over, and to-morrow mornin&rsquo; tell me how you feel about it.&rdquo; He hesitated a
      moment and then added: &ldquo;You know your grandmother and I, we&mdash;well, we
      have maybe cause to be a little mite prejudiced against this elopin&rsquo; 
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Albert thought, and the next morning, as the pair were walking together
      to the office, he spoke his thought. Captain Zelotes had not mentioned the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; said Albert, with some embarrassment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give
      you that promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather, who had been striding along, his heavy brows drawn
      together and his glance fixed upon the frozen ground beneath his feet,
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he queried, uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me last night to promise you something, you know. . . . You
      asked me to think it over. I have, and I&rsquo;m going to promise you that&mdash;Madeline
      and I won&rsquo;t marry without first telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes stopped in his stride; then he walked on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Al,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d see it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I&mdash;I do. I don&rsquo;t want to bring any more&mdash;trouble
      of that kind to you and Grandmother. . . . It seems to me that you&mdash;that
      you have had too much already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, son. . . . Much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s tone was almost gruff and that was his only reference to the
      subject of the promise; but somehow Albert felt that at that moment he and
      his grandfather were closer together, were nearer to a mutual
      understanding and mutual appreciation than they had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To promise, however, is one thing, to fulfill the obligation another. As
      the days passed Albert found his promise concerning letter-writing very,
      very hard to keep. When, each evening he sat down at the table in his room
      to pour out his soul upon paper it was a most unsatisfactory outpouring.
      The constantly enforced recollection that whatever he wrote would be
      subject to the chilling glance of the eye of Fosdick mater was of itself a
      check upon the flow. To write a love letter to Madeline had hitherto been
      a joy, a rapture, to fill pages and pages a delight. Now, somehow, these
      pages were hard to fill. Omitting the very things you were dying to say,
      the precious, the intimate things&mdash;what was there left? He and she
      had, at their meetings and in their former correspondence, invented many
      delightful little pet names for each other. Now those names were taboo;
      or, at any rate, they might as well be. The thought of Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s
      sniff of indignant disgust at finding her daughter referred to as some
      one&rsquo;s ownest little rosebud withered that bud before it reached the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Madeline&rsquo;s letters to him were quite as unsatisfactory. They were
      lengthy, but oh, so matter of fact! Saharas of fact without one oasis of
      sentiment. She was well and she had done this and that and had been to see
      such and such plays and operas. Father was well and very busy. Mother,
      too, was well, so was Googoo&mdash;but these last two bits of news failed
      to comfort him as they perhaps should. He could only try to glean between
      the lines, and as Mrs. Fosdick had raked between those lines before him,
      the gleaning was scant picking indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself growing disconsolate and despondent. Summer seemed ages
      away. And when at last it should come&mdash;what would happen then? He
      could see her only when properly chaperoned, only when Mother, and
      probably Googoo, were present. He flew for consolation to the Muse and the
      Muse refused to console. The poems he wrote were &ldquo;blue&rdquo; and despairing
      likewise. Consequently they did not sell. He was growing desperate, ready
      for anything. And something came. Germany delivered to our Government its
      arrogant mandate concerning unlimited submarine warfare. A long-suffering
      President threw patience overboard and answered that mandate in
      unmistakable terms. Congress stood at his back and behind them a united
      and indignant people. The United States declared war upon the Hun.
    </p>
    <p>
      South Harniss, like every other community, became wildly excited. Captain
      Zelotes Snow&rsquo;s gray eyes flashed fiery satisfaction. The flags at the Snow
      place and at the lumber yard flew high night and day. He bought newspapers
      galore and read from them aloud at meals, in the evenings, and before
      breakfast. Issachar, as usual, talked much and said little. Laban Keeler&rsquo;s
      comments were pithy and dryly pointed. Albert was very quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one forenoon he spoke. Captain Lote was in the inner office, the
      morning newspaper in his hand, when his grandson entered and closed the
      door behind him. The captain looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Al, what is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert came over and stood beside the desk. The captain, after a moment&rsquo;s
      scrutiny of the young man&rsquo;s face, put down his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Al?&rdquo; he said, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert seemed to find it hard to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Grandfather, I have come to ask
      a favor of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded, slowly, his gaze fixed upon his grandson&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; heave ahead,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather, you and I have had a four years&rsquo; agreement to work together
      in this office. It isn&rsquo;t up yet, but&mdash;but I want to break it. I want
      you to let me off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! . . . Let you off, eh? . . . What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came here to tell you. Grandfather, I can&rsquo;t stay here&mdash;now.
      I want to enlist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes did not answer. His hand moved upward and pulled at his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to enlist,&rdquo; repeated Albert. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it another minute. I
      must. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you and our promise and&mdash;and Madeline, I
      think I should have joined the Canadian Army a year or more ago. But now
      that we have gone into the war, I CAN&rsquo;T stay out. Grandfather, you don&rsquo;t
      want me to, do you? Of course you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather appeared to ponder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can wait a spell,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I might be able to fix it so&rsquo;s
      you can get a chance for an officer&rsquo;s commission. I&rsquo;d ought to have some
      pull somewheres, seems so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert sniffed impatient disgust. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get a commission&mdash;in
      that way,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s plenty that do, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, but I&rsquo;m not one of them. And I don&rsquo;t care so much for a
      commission, unless I can earn it. And I don&rsquo;t want to stay here and study
      for it. I want to go now. I want to get into the thing. I don&rsquo;t want to
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote leaned forward. His gray eyes snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to fight, do you?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my boy, then go&mdash;and fight. I&rsquo;d be ashamed of myself if I
      held you back a minute. Go and fight&mdash;and fight hard. I only wish to
      God I was young enough to go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      And so, in this unexpected fashion, came prematurely the end of the four
      year trial agreement between Albert Speranza and Z. Snow and Co. Of course
      neither Captain Zelotes nor Albert admitted that it had ended. Each
      professed to regard the break as merely temporary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be back at that desk in a little while, Al,&rdquo; said the captain,
      &ldquo;addin&rsquo; up figgers and tormentin&rsquo; Issy.&rdquo; And Albert&rsquo;s reply was
      invariably, &ldquo;Why, of course, Grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had dreaded his grandmother&rsquo;s reception of the news of his intended
      enlistment. Olive worshiped her daughter&rsquo;s boy and, although an ardent
      patriot, was by no means as fiercely belligerent as her husband. She
      prayed each night for the defeat of the Hun, whereas Captain Lote was for
      licking him first and praying afterwards. Albert feared a scene; he feared
      that she might be prostrated when she learned that he was to go to war.
      But she bore it wonderfully well, and as for the dreaded &ldquo;scene,&rdquo; there
      was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes says he thinks it&rsquo;s the right thing for you to do, Albert,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;so I suppose I ought to think so, too. But, oh, my dear, DO you
      really feel that you must? I&mdash;it don&rsquo;t seem as I could bear to . . .
      but there, I mustn&rsquo;t talk so. It ain&rsquo;t a mite harder for me than it is for
      thousands of women all over this world. . . . And perhaps the government
      folks won&rsquo;t take you, anyway. Rachel said she read in the Item about some
      young man over in Bayport who was rejected because he had fat feet. She
      meant flat feet, I suppose, poor thing. Oh, dear me, I&rsquo;m laughin&rsquo;, and it
      seems wicked to laugh a time like this. And when I think of you goin&rsquo;,
      Albert, I&mdash;I . . . but there, I promised Zelotes I wouldn&rsquo;t. . . .
      And they MAY not take you. . . . But oh, of course they will, of course
      they will! . . . I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to make you a chicken pie for dinner to-day; I
      know how you like it. . . . If only they MIGHT reject you! . . . But
      there, I said I wouldn&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel Ellis&rsquo;s opinion on the subject and her way of expressing that
      opinion were distinctly her own. Albert arose early in the morning
      following the announcement of his decision to enter the service. He had
      not slept well; his mind was too busy with problems and speculations to
      resign itself to sleep. He had tossed about until dawn and had then risen
      and sat down at the table in his bedroom to write Madeline of the step he
      had determined to take. He had not written her while he was considering
      that step. He felt, somehow, that he alone with no pressure from without
      should make the decision. Now that it was made, and irrevocably made, she
      must of course be told. Telling her, however, was not an easy task. He was
      sure she would agree that he had done the right thing, the only thing, but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is going to be very hard for you, dear,&rdquo; he wrote, heedless of the
      fact that Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s censorious eye would see and condemn the &ldquo;dear.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;It is going to be hard for both of us. But I am sure you will feel as I
      do that I COULDN&rsquo;T do anything else. I am young and strong and fit and I
      am an American. I MUST go. You see it, don&rsquo;t you, Madeline. I can hardly
      wait until your letter comes telling me that you feel I did just the thing
      you would wish me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and then, even more regardless of the censor, added the
      quotation which countless young lovers were finding so apt just then:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,
        Loved I not honor more.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So when, fresh from the intimacy of this communication with his adored and
      with the letter in his hand, he entered the sitting-room at that early
      hour he was not overjoyed to find the housekeeper there ahead of him. And
      her first sentence showed that she had been awaiting his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good mornin&rsquo;, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I heard you stirrin&rsquo; &lsquo;round up in your
      room and I came down here so&rsquo;s you and I could talk together for a minute
      without anybody&rsquo;s disturbin&rsquo; us. . . . Humph! I guess likely you didn&rsquo;t
      sleep any too well last night, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. &ldquo;Not too well, Rachel,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Well, I doubt if there was too much sleep anywheres
      in this house last night. So you&rsquo;re really goin&rsquo; to war, are you, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If the war will let me I certainly am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear! . . . Well, I&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s what Robert Penfold would
      have done if he was in your place. I&rsquo;ve been goin&rsquo; over it and goin&rsquo; over
      it half the night, myself, and I&rsquo;ve come to that conclusion. It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      be awful hard on your grandma and grandfather and me and Labe, all us
      folks here at home, but I guess it&rsquo;s the thing you&rsquo;d ought to do, the
      Penfold kind of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so, Rachel,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, and if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell the truth I might as well say I
      tried terrible hard to find some good reasons for thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;twan&rsquo;t. I did
      SO! But the only good reasons I could scare up for makin&rsquo; you stay to home
      was because home was safe and comf&rsquo;table and where you was goin&rsquo; wan&rsquo;t.
      And that kind of reasonin&rsquo; might do fust-rate for a passel of clams out on
      the flats, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be much credit to decent, self-respectin&rsquo; 
      humans. When General Rolleson came to that island and found his daughter
      and Robert Penfold livin&rsquo; there in that house made out of pearls he&rsquo;d
      built for her&mdash;Wan&rsquo;t that him all over! Another man, the common run
      of man, would have been satisfied to build her a house out of wood and
      lucky to get that, but no, nothin&rsquo; would do him but pearls, and if they&rsquo;d
      have been di&rsquo;monds he&rsquo;d have been better satisfied. Well. . . . Where was
      I? . . . Oh yes! When General Rolleson came there and says to his
      daughter, &lsquo;Helen, you come home along of me,&rsquo; and she says, &lsquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t
      leave him,&rsquo; meanin&rsquo; Robert Penfold, you understand&mdash;When she says
      that did Robert Penfold say, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the talk! Put that in your pipe, old
      man, and smoke it?&rsquo; No, SIR, he didn&rsquo;t! He says, &lsquo;Helen, you go straight
      home along with your pa and work like fury till you find out who forged
      that note and laid it onto me. You find that out,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;and then you
      can come fetch me and not afore.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the kind of man HE was! And they
      sailed off and left him behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. He had heard only about half of the housekeeper&rsquo;s
      story. &ldquo;Pretty rough on him, I should say,&rdquo; he commented, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I GUESS &lsquo;twas rough on him, poor thing! But &lsquo;twas his duty and so he done
      it. It was rough on Helen, havin&rsquo; to go and leave him, but &lsquo;twas rougher
      still on him. It&rsquo;s always roughest, seems to me,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;on the ones
      that&rsquo;s left behind. Those that go have somethin&rsquo; to take up their minds
      and keep &lsquo;em from thinkin&rsquo; too much. The ones that stay to home don&rsquo;t have
      much to do EXCEPT think. I hope you don&rsquo;t get the notion that I feel your
      part of it is easy, Al. Only a poor, crazy idiot could read the papers
      these days and feel that any part of this war was EASY! It&rsquo;s awful, but&mdash;but
      it WILL keep you too busy to think, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, Rachel. I understand what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all goin&rsquo; to miss you, Albert. This house is goin&rsquo; to be a pretty
      lonesome place, I cal&rsquo;late. Your grandma&rsquo;ll miss you dreadful and so will
      I, but&mdash;but I have a notion that your grandpa&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to miss you
      more&rsquo;n anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;Oh, not as much as all that, Rachel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He and
      I have been getting on much better than we used to and we have come to
      understand each other better, but he is still disappointed in me. I&rsquo;m
      afraid I don&rsquo;t count for much as a business man, you see; and, besides,
      Grandfather can never quite forget that I am the son of what he calls a
      Portygee play actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis looked at him earnestly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgettin&rsquo; it better every day,
      Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do declare I never believed Capt&rsquo;n Lote Snow could
      forget it the way he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;. And you&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ve forgot a whole
      lot, too. Memory&rsquo;s a good thing, the land knows,&rdquo; she added, sagely, &ldquo;but
      a nice healthy forgetery is worth consider&rsquo;ble&mdash;some times and in
      some cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar Price&rsquo;s comments on his fellow employee&rsquo;s decision to become a
      soldier were pointed. Issy was disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For thunder sakes, Al,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t true that you&rsquo;ve enlisted
      to go to war and fight them Germans, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;I guess it is, Issy,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by crimus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody had to go, you see, Is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by crimustee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Issy? Don&rsquo;t you approve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approve! No, by crimus, I don&rsquo;t approve! I think it&rsquo;s a divil of a note,
      that&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHY? Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do the work in this office while you&rsquo;re gone? Labe
      and me, that&rsquo;s who; and I&rsquo;ll do the heft of it. Slavin&rsquo; myself half to
      death as &lsquo;tis and now&mdash;Oh, by crimustee! This war is a darned
      nuisance. It hadn&rsquo;t ought to be allowed. There&rsquo;d ought to be a law against
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But of all the interviews which followed Albert&rsquo;s decision the most
      surprising and that which he was the least likely to forget was his
      interview with Laban Keeler. It took place on the evening of the third day
      following the announcement of his intention to enlist. All that day, and
      indeed for several days, Albert had noted in the little bookkeeper certain
      symptoms, familiar symptoms they were and from experience the young man
      knew what they portended. Laban was very nervous, his fingers twitched as
      he wrote, occasionally he rose from his chair and walked up and down the
      room, he ran his hand through his scanty hair, he was inclined to be
      irritable&mdash;that is, irritable for him. Albert had noted the symptoms
      and was sorry. Captain Zelotes noted them and frowned and pulled his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; he said to his grandson, &ldquo;if you can put off goin&rsquo; up to enlist for
      a little spell, a few days, I wish you would. Labe&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; ready to go
      on one of his vacations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he is,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s as sartin as two and two makes four. I&rsquo;ve lived with him too
      many years not to know the signs. And I did hope,&rdquo; he added, regretfully,
      &ldquo;that maybe he was tryin&rsquo; to break off. It&rsquo;s been a good long spell, an
      extry long spell, since he had his last spree. Ah hum! it&rsquo;s a pity a good
      man should have that weak spot in him, ain&rsquo;t it? But if you could hang
      around a few more days, while the vacation&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on, I&rsquo;d appreciate it,
      Al. I kind of hate to be left here alone with nobody but Issachar to lean
      on. Issy&rsquo;s a good deal like a post in some ways, especially in the makeup
      of his head, but he&rsquo;s too ricketty to lean on for any length of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Albert went to the post-office for the mail. On his way back
      as he passed the dark corner by the now closed and shuttered
      moving-picture theater he was hailed in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; said a voice, &ldquo;Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned and peered into the deep shadow of the theater doorway. In
      the summer this doorway was a blaze of light and gaiety; now it was cold
      and bleak and black enough. From the shadow a small figure emerged on
      tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Keeler. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you, ain&rsquo;t it? Yes, yes&mdash;yes,
      yes, yes&mdash;I thought &lsquo;twas, I thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was surprised. For one thing it was most unusual to see the little
      bookkeeper abroad after nine-thirty. His usual evening procedure, when not
      on a vacation, was to call upon Rachel Ellis at the Snow place for an hour
      or so and then to return to his room over Simond&rsquo;s shoe store, which room
      he had occupied ever since the building was erected.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he read, so people said, until eleven sharp, when his lamp was
      extinguished. During or at the beginning of the vacation periods he
      usually departed for some unknown destination, destinations which,
      apparently, varied. He had been seen, hopelessly intoxicated, in Bayport,
      in Ostable, in Boston, once in Providence. When he returned he never
      seemed to remember exactly where he had been. And, as most people were
      fond of and pitied him, few questions were asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Labe!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert. &ldquo;Is that you? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy, are you, Al?&rdquo; queried Laban. &ldquo;In a hurry, eh? Are you? In a hurry,
      Al, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, not especially.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you&mdash;could you spare me two or three minutes? Two or three
      minutes&mdash;yes, yes? Come up to my room, could you&mdash;could you,
      Al?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed. But what is it, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk. Want to talk, I do. Yes, yes, yes. Saw you go by and I&rsquo;ve
      been waitin&rsquo; for you. Waitin&rsquo;&mdash;yes, I have&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized his assistant by the arm and led him across the road toward the
      shoe store. Albert felt the hand on his arm tremble violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you cold, Labe?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What makes you shiver so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Cold? No, I ain&rsquo;t cold&mdash;no, no, no. Come, Al, come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert sniffed suspiciously, but no odor of alcohol rewarded the sniff.
      Neither was there any perfume of peppermint, Mr. Keeler&rsquo;s transparent
      camouflage at a vacation&rsquo;s beginning. And Laban was not humming the
      refrain glorifying his &ldquo;darling hanky-panky.&rdquo; Apparently he had not yet
      embarked upon the spree which Captain Lote had pronounced imminent. But
      why did he behave so queerly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t the way you think, Al,&rdquo; declared the little man, divining his
      thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just kind of shaky and nervous, that&rsquo;s all. That&rsquo;s all,
      that&rsquo;s all, that&rsquo;s all. Yes, yes. Come, come! COME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last &ldquo;come&rdquo; burst from him in an agony of impatience. Albert hastened
      up the narrow stairs, Laban leading the way. The latter fumbled with a
      key, his companion heard it rattling against the keyhole plate. Then the
      door opened. There was a lamp, its wick turned low, burning upon the table
      in the room. Mr. Keeler turned it up, making a trembly job of the turning.
      Albert looked about him; he had never been in that room before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a small room and there was not much furniture in it. And it was a
      neat room, for the room of an old bachelor who was his own chambermaid.
      Most things seemed to have places where they belonged and most of them
      appeared to be in those places. What impressed Albert even more was the
      number of books. There were books everywhere, in the cheap bookcase, on
      the pine shelf between the windows, piled in the corners, heaped on the
      table beside the lamp. They were worn and shabby volumes for the most
      part, some with but half a cover remaining, some with none. He picked up
      one of the latter. It was Locke on The Human Understanding; and next it,
      to his astonishment, was Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler looked over his shoulder and, for an instant, the whimsical
      smile which was characteristic of him curved his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophy, Al,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If Locke don&rsquo;t suit you try the &lsquo;mad
      hatter&rsquo; feller. I get consider&rsquo;ble comfort out of the hatter, myself. Do
      you remember when the mouse was tellin&rsquo; the story about the three sisters
      that lived in the well? He said they lived on everything that began with
      M. Alice says &lsquo;Why with an M?&rsquo; And the hatter, or the March hare, I forget
      which &lsquo;twas, says prompt, &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; . . . Yes, yes, why not? that&rsquo;s what
      he said. . . . There&rsquo;s some philosophy in that, Al. Why does a hen go
      across the road? Why not? Why is Labe Keeler a disgrace to all his friends
      and the town he lives in? Why not? . . . Eh? . . . Yes, yes. That&rsquo;s it&mdash;why
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again, but there was bitterness and not humor in the smile.
      Albert put a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Labe,&rdquo; he asked, in concern, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind, me, Al,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;I mean don&rsquo;t mind if I act
      funny. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m kind of&mdash;of&mdash;Oh, good Lord A&rsquo;mighty, DON&rsquo;T
      look at me like that! . . . I beg your pardon, Al. I didn&rsquo;t mean to bark
      like a dog at you. No, I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, no. Forgive me, will you? Will
      you, Al, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will. But what is the matter, Labe? Sit down and tell me
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of sitting the little bookkeeper began to walk up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, Al,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me. Let me go my own
      gait. My own gait&mdash;yes, yes. You see, Al, I&mdash;I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to
      enlist, same as you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do, and&mdash;and MY fight&rsquo;s begun
      already. Yes indeed&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;it has so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was more astonished than ever. There was no smell of alcohol, and
      Keeler had declared that he had not been drinking; but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to ENLIST?&rdquo; repeated Albert. &ldquo;YOU? Why, Labe, what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban laughed nervously. &ldquo;Not to kill the Kaiser,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No, no,
      not that&mdash;not exactly. I&rsquo;d like to, only I wouldn&rsquo;t be much help that
      way. But&mdash;but Al, I&mdash;I want to do somethin&rsquo;. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to
      try to show&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to be an American, a decent American, and the
      best way to begin, seems to me, is to try and be a man, a decent man. Eh?
      You understand, I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, Lord, what a mess I am makin&rsquo; of this!
      I&mdash;I&mdash;Al,&rdquo; turning and desperately waving his hands, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; 
      to try to swear off. Will you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s answer was enthusiastic. &ldquo;You bet I will!&rdquo; he exclaimed. Keeler
      smiled pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be some job, I cal&rsquo;late,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some job, yes, yes. But
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to try it, Al. I read in the papers &lsquo;tother day that America
      needed every man. Then you enlisted, Al,&mdash;or you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to enlist.
      It set me to thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d try to enlist, too. For the duration of the war,
      eh? Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, Labe! Bully!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban held up a protesting hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurrah yet, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This
      ain&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve tried it. I&rsquo;ve swore off a dozen times in the
      last fifteen years. I&rsquo;ve promised Rachel and broke the promise over and
      over again. Broke my promise to her, the best woman in the world. Shows
      what I am, what sort I am, don&rsquo;t it, Al? Yes, it does,&mdash;yes, yes. And
      she&rsquo;s stuck by me, too, Lord knows why. Last time I broke it I said I&rsquo;d
      never promise her again. Bad enough to be a common drunk without bein&rsquo; a
      liar&mdash;yes, yes. But this is a little different. Seems to me&mdash;seems
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began his pacing up and down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems different, somehow,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Seems like a new chance. I want
      to do somethin&rsquo; for Uncle Sam. I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to try and enlist for the
      duration of the war&mdash;swear off for that long, anyhow. Then, maybe,
      I&rsquo;d be able to keep on for life, you know&mdash;duration of Labe Keeler,
      eh? Yes, yes, yes. But I could begin for just the war, couldn&rsquo;t I? Maybe,
      &lsquo;twould fool me into thinkin&rsquo; that was easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Labe. It&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe; and maybe it&rsquo;s a fool one. But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to try it. I AM tryin&rsquo; 
      it, have been all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, drew a shaking hand across his forehead and then asked, &ldquo;Al,
      will you help me? I asked you up here hopin&rsquo; you would. Will you, Al, eh?
      Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert could not understand how he could possibly help another man keep
      the pledge, but his promise was eagerly given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Labe,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks . . . thank you, Al. . . . And now will you do something for me&mdash;a
      favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladly. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban did not answer at once. He appeared to be on the point of doing so,
      but to be struggling either to find words or to overcome a tremendous
      reluctance. When he did speak the words came in a burst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down stairs,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Down those stairs you came up. At the foot of
      &lsquo;em, in a kind of cupboard place, under &lsquo;em, there&rsquo;s&mdash;there probably
      is a jug, a full jug. It was due to come by express to-day and I cal&rsquo;late
      it did, cal&rsquo;late Jim Young fetched it down this afternoon. I&mdash;I could
      have looked for myself and seen if &lsquo;twas there,&rdquo; he added, after a
      momentary hesitation, &ldquo;but&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t dare to. I was afraid I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Labe. I understand. What do you want me to do with it if it is
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you&mdash;I want you to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; The little bookkeeper
      seemed to be fighting another internal battle between inclination and
      resolution. The latter won, for he finished with, &ldquo;I want you to take it
      out back of the buildin&rsquo; and&mdash;and empty it. That&rsquo;s what I want you to
      do, empty it, Al, every drop. . . . And, for the Almighty&rsquo;s sake, go
      quick,&rdquo; he ordered, desperately, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll tell you not to before you
      start. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert went. He fumbled in the cupboard under the stairs, found the jug&mdash;a
      large one and heavy&mdash;and hastened out into the night with it in his
      hands. Behind the shoe store, amid a heap of old packing boxes and other
      rubbish, he emptied it. The process was rather lengthy and decidedly
      fragrant. As a finish he smashed the jug with a stone. Then he climbed the
      stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban was waiting for him, drops of perspiration upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was&mdash;was it there?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. &lsquo;Twas there, eh? And did you&mdash;did you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did, jug and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Al . . . thank you . . . I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been trying to muster up
      spunk enough to do it myself, but&mdash;but I swan I couldn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t
      dast to go nigh it . . . I&rsquo;m a fine specimen, ain&rsquo;t I, now?&rdquo; he added,
      with a twisted smile. &ldquo;Some coward, eh? Yes, yes. Some coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, realizing a little of the fight the man was making, was affected
      by it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick, Labe,&rdquo; he declared, heartily. &ldquo;And as for being a
      coward&mdash;Well, if I am half as brave when my turn comes I shall be
      satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how scared I&rsquo;d be of a German
      bombshell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m everlastin&rsquo; sure I wouldn&rsquo;t run from it for
      fear of runnin&rsquo; towards it, and that&rsquo;s how I felt about that jug. . . .
      Yes, yes, yes. I did so . . . I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Al. I shan&rsquo;t forget
      it&mdash;no, no. I cal&rsquo;late you can trot along home now, if you want to.
      I&rsquo;m pretty safe&mdash;for to-night, anyhow. Guess likely the new recruit
      won&rsquo;t desert afore morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Albert, watching him intently, refused to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay for a while, Labe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit sleepy,
      really. Let&rsquo;s have a smoke and talk together. That is, of course, unless
      you want to go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler smiled his twisted smile. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t crazy to,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The way
      I feel now I&rsquo;d get to sleep about week after next. But I hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      keep you up, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! I&rsquo;m not sleepy, I tell you. Sit down. Have a cigar. Now what
      shall we talk about? How would books do? What have you been reading
      lately, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They smoked and talked books until nearly two. Then Laban insisted upon
      his guest departing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Al&rdquo; he declared, earnestly. &ldquo;I am
      honest&mdash;yes, yes, I am. I&rsquo;ll go to sleep like a lamb, yes indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be at the office in the morning, won&rsquo;t you, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little bookkeeper nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Got to answer
      roll call the first mornin&rsquo; after enlistment. Yes, yes. I&rsquo;ll be there,
      Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was there, but he did not look as if his indulgence in the lamb-like
      sleep had been excessive. He was so pale and haggard that his assistant
      was alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sick, are you, Labe?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously. Laban shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t sick. Been doin&rsquo; picket duty up and down the
      room since half past three, that&rsquo;s all. Um-hm, that&rsquo;s all. Say, Al, if
      General what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;er&mdash;von Hindenburg&mdash;is any harder
      scrapper than old Field Marshal Barleycorn he&rsquo;s a pretty tough one. Say,
      Al, you didn&rsquo;t say anything about&mdash;about my&mdash;er&mdash;enlistin&rsquo; 
      to Cap&rsquo;n Lote, did you? I meant to ask you not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Labe. I thought you might want it kept a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Better keep it in the ranks until we know how this first&mdash;er&mdash;skirmish
      is comin&rsquo; out. Yes, yes. Better keep it that way. Um-hm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All day he stuck manfully at his task and that evening, immediately after
      supper, Albert went to the room over the shoe store, found him there and
      insisted upon his coming over to call upon Rachel. He had not intended
      doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Al,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m kind of&mdash;er&mdash;shaky
      and Rachel will be worried, I&rsquo;m afraid. She knows me pretty well and
      she&rsquo;ll cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;m just gettin&rsquo; ready to&mdash;to bust loose again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert interrupted. &ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t, Laban,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show her that
      you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say anything to her about my&mdash;er&mdash;enlistin&rsquo;, Al?
      Don&rsquo;t. No, no. I&rsquo;ve promised her too many times&mdash;and broke the
      promises. If anything should come of this fight of mine I&rsquo;d rather she&rsquo;d
      find it out for herself. Better to surprise her than to disapp&rsquo;int her.
      Yes, yes, lots better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert promised not to tell Rachel and so Laban made his call. When it was
      over the young man walked home with him and the pair sat and talked until
      after midnight, just as on the previous night. The following evening it
      was much the same, except that, as Mr. Keeler pronounced himself more than
      usually &ldquo;shaky&rdquo; and expressed a desire to &ldquo;keep movin&rsquo;,&rdquo; they walked half
      way to Orham and back before parting. By the end of the week Laban
      declared the fight won&mdash;for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pulled me through the fust tussle, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t desert
      now, not till the next break-out, anyhow. I cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;ll get me harder
      than ever then. Harder than ever&mdash;yes, yes. And you won&rsquo;t be here to
      help me, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind; I shall be thinking of you, Labe. And I know you&rsquo;re going to
      win. I feel it in my bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. . . . Yes, yes, yes. . . In your bones, eh? Well, MY bones don&rsquo;t
      seem to feel much, except rheumatics once in a while. I hope yours are
      better prophets, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to bet too high on it. No, I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;no,
      no. However, we&rsquo;ll do our best, and they say angels can&rsquo;t do any more&mdash;though
      they&rsquo;d probably do it in a different way . . . some different. . . .
      Um-hm. . . . Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two letters came to Albert before that week ended. The first was from
      Madeline. He had written her of his intention to enlist and this was her
      reply. The letter had evidently been smuggled past the censor, for it
      contained much which Mrs. Fosdick would have blue-penciled. Its contents
      were a blend of praise and blame, of exaltation and depression. He was a
      hero, and so brave, and she was so proud of him. It was wonderful his
      daring to go, and just what she would have expected of her hero. If only
      she might see him in his uniform. So many of the fellows she knew had
      enlisted. They were wonderfully brave, too, although of course nothing
      like as wonderful as her own etcetera, etcetera. She had seen some of THEM
      in their uniforms and they were PERFECTLY SPLENDID. But they were
      officers, or they were going to be. Why wasn&rsquo;t he going to be an officer?
      It was so much nicer to be an officer. And if he were one he might not
      have to go away to fight nearly so soon. Officers stayed here longer and
      studied, you know. Mother had said something about &ldquo;a common private,&rdquo; and
      she did not like it. But never mind, she would be just as proud no matter
      what he was. And she should dream of him and think of him always and
      always. And perhaps he might be so brave and wonderful that he would be
      given one of those war crosses, the Croix de Guerre or something. She was
      sure he would. But oh, no matter what happened, he must not go where it
      was TOO dangerous. Suppose he should be wounded. Oh, suppose, SUPPOSE he
      should be killed. What would she do then? What would become of her? MUST
      he go, after all? Couldn&rsquo;t he stay at home and study or something, for a
      while, you know? She should be so lonely after he was gone. And so
      frightened and so anxious. And he wouldn&rsquo;t forget her, would he, no matter
      where he went? Because she never, never, never would forget him for a
      moment. And he must write every day. And&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was fourteen pages long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other letter was a surprise. It was from Helen. The Reverend Mr.
      Kendall had been told of Albert&rsquo;s intended enlistment and had written his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you are going into the war, Albert (she wrote). I am not surprised
      because I expected you would do just that. It is what all of us would like
      to do, I&rsquo;m sure, and you were always anxious to go, even before the United
      States came in. So I am writing this merely to congratulate you and to
      wish you the very best of good luck. Father says you are not going to try
      for a commission but intend enlisting as a private. I suppose that is
      because you think you may get to the actual fighting sooner. I think I
      understand and appreciate that feeling too, but are you sure it is the
      best plan? You want to be of the greatest service to the country and with
      your education and brains&mdash;This ISN&rsquo;T flattery, because it is true&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you think you might help more if you were in command of men? Of course I
      don&rsquo;t know, being only a girl, but I have been wondering. No doubt you
      know best and probably it is settled before this; at any rate, please
      don&rsquo;t think that I intend butting in. &ldquo;Butting in&rdquo; is not at all a proper
      expression for a schoolmarm to use but it is a relief to be human
      occasionally. Whatever you do I am sure will be the right thing and I know
      all your friends are going to be very, very proud of you. I shall hear of
      you through the people at home, I know, and I shall be anxious to hear. I
      don&rsquo;t know what I shall do to help the cause, but I hope to do something.
      A musket is prohibitive to females but the knitting needle is ours and I
      CAN handle that, if I do say it. And I MAY go in for Red Cross work
      altogether. But I don&rsquo;t count much, and you men do, and this is your day.
      Please, for the sake of your grandparents and all your friends, don&rsquo;t take
      unnecessary chances. I can see your face as you read that and think that I
      am a silly idiot. I&rsquo;m not and I mean what I say. You see I know YOU and I
      know you will not be content to do the ordinary thing. We want you to
      distinguish yourself, but also we want you to come back whole and sound,
      if it is possible. We shall think of you a great deal. And please, in the
      midst of the excitement of the BIG work you are doing, don&rsquo;t forget us
      home folk, including your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      HELEN KENDALL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s feelings when he read this letter were divided. He enjoyed
      hearing from Helen. The letter was just like herself, sensible and
      good-humored and friendly. There were no hysterics in it and no heroics
      but he knew that no one except his grandparents and Rachel and Laban&mdash;and,
      of course, his own Madeline&mdash;would think of him oftener or be more
      anxious for his safety and welfare than Helen. He was glad she was his
      friend, very glad. But he almost wished she had not written. He felt a bit
      guilty at having received the letter. He was pretty sure that Madeline
      would not like the idea. He was tempted to say nothing concerning it in
      his next letter to his affianced, but that seemed underhanded and
      cowardly, so he told her. And in her next letter to him Madeline made no
      reference at all to Helen or her epistle, so he knew she was displeased.
      And he was miserable in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his misery did not last long. The happenings which followed crowded it
      from his mind, and from Madeline&rsquo;s also, for that matter. One morning,
      having told no one except his grandfather of his intention, he took the
      morning train to Boston. When he returned the next day he was Uncle Sam&rsquo;s
      man, sworn in and accepted. He had passed the physical examination with
      flying colors and the recruiting officers expressed themselves as being
      glad to get him. He was home for but one day leave, then he must go to
      stay. He had debated the question of going in for a commission, but those
      were the early days of our participation in the war and a Plattsburg
      training or at least some sort of military education was almost an
      essential. He did not want to wait; as he had told his grandfather, he
      wanted to fight. So he enlisted as a private.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the brief leave was over he took the train for Boston, no longer
      Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza, South Harniss&rsquo;s Beau Brummel, poet and
      Portygee, but Private Speranza, U.S.A. The farewells were brief and no one
      cried&mdash;much. His grandmother hugged and kissed him, Rachel looked
      very much as if she wanted to. Laban and Issachar shook hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck to you, boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Keeler. &ldquo;All the luck there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same to you, old man,&rdquo; replied Albert. Then, in a lower tone, he added,
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight it out together, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try. Yes, yes. We&rsquo;ll try. So long, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar struck the reassuring note. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret about things in the
      office,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for &lsquo;em long&rsquo;s I keep my health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure and keep that, Issy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you! Only thing that&rsquo;s liable to break it down is over-work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes said very little. &ldquo;Write us when you can, Al,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;And come home whenever you get leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure of that, Grandfather. And after I get to camp perhaps you
      can come and see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so. Will if I can. . . . Well, Al, I . . . I. . . . Good luck to
      you, son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands. Each looked as if there was more he would have liked to
      say but found the saying hard. Then the engine bell rang and the hands
      fell apart. The little group on the station platform watched the train
      disappear. Mrs. Snow and Rachel wiped their eyes with their handkerchiefs.
      Captain Zelotes gently patted his wife&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The team&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo;, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Labe&rsquo;ll drive you and Rachel
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo;, too, Zelotes?&rdquo; faltered Olive. Her
      husband shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now, Mother,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Got to go back to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood for an instant looking at the faint smear of smoke above the
      curve in the track. Then, without another word, he strode off in the
      direction of Z. Snow and Co.&lsquo;s buildings. Issachar Price sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crimus,&rdquo; he whispered to Laban, as the latter passed him on the way to
      where Jessamine, the Snow horse, was tied, &ldquo;the old man takes it cool,
      don&rsquo;t he! I kind of imagined he&rsquo;d be sort of shook up by Al&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; off to
      war, but he don&rsquo;t seem to feel it a mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keeler looked at him in wonder. Then he drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;it is a mighty good thing for the Seven Wise Men
      of Greece that they ain&rsquo;t alive now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Issachar&rsquo;s turn to stare. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;The Seven Wise Men of
      Which? Good thing for &lsquo;em they ain&rsquo;t alive? What kind of talk&rsquo;s that? Why
      is it a good thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban spoke over his shoulder. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;if they was alive
      now they&rsquo;d be so jealous of you they&rsquo;d commit suicide. Yes, they would. .
      . . Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which enigmatical remark he left Mr. Price and turned his attention
      to the tethered Jessamine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then began a new period, a new life at the Snow place and in the
      office of Z. Snow and Co. Or, rather, life in the old house and at the
      lumber and hardware office slumped back into the groove in which it had
      run before the opera singer&rsquo;s son was summoned from the New York school to
      the home and into the lives of his grandparents. Three people instead of
      four sat down at the breakfast table and at dinner and at supper. Captain
      Zelotes walked alone to and from the office. Olive Snow no longer baked
      and iced large chocolate layer cakes because a certain inmate of her
      household was so fond of them. Rachel Ellis discussed Foul Play and Robert
      Penfold with no one. The house was emptier, more old-fashioned and behind
      the times, more lonely&mdash;surprisingly empty and behind the times and
      lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daily mails became matters of intense interest and expectation. Albert
      wrote regularly and of course well and entertainingly. He described the
      life at the camp where he and the other recruits were training, a camp
      vastly different from the enormous military towns built later on for
      housing and training the drafted men. He liked the life pretty well, he
      wrote, although it was hard and a fellow had precious little opportunity
      to be lazy. Mistakes, too, were unprofitable for the maker. Captain Lote&rsquo;s
      eye twinkled when he read that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he wrote that he had been made a corporal and his grandmother, to
      whom a major general and a corporal were of equal rank, rejoiced much both
      at home and in church after meeting was over and friends came to hear the
      news. Mrs. Ellis declared herself not surprised. It was the Robert Penfold
      in him coming out, so she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month or two later one of Albert&rsquo;s letters contained an interesting item
      of news. In the little spare time which military life afforded him he
      continued to write verse and stories. Now a New York publisher, not one of
      the most prominent but a reputable and enterprising one, had written him
      suggesting the collecting of his poems and their publication in book form.
      The poet himself was, naturally, elated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it splendid!&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The best part of it, of course, is that he
      asked to publish, I did not ask him. Please send me my scrapbook and all
      loose manuscript. When the book will come out I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. In
      fact it may never come out, we have not gotten as far as terms and
      contracts yet, but I feel we shall. Send the scrapbook and manuscript
      right away, PLEASE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were sent. In his next letter Albert was still enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been looking over my stuff,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and some of it is pretty
      good, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so. Tell Grandfather that when this book
      of mine is out and selling I may be able to show him that poetry making
      isn&rsquo;t a pauper&rsquo;s job, after all. Of course I don&rsquo;t know how much it will
      sell&mdash;perhaps not more than five or ten thousand at first&mdash;but
      even at ten thousand at, say, twenty-five cents royalty each, would be
      twenty-five hundred dollars, and that&rsquo;s something. Why, Ben Hur, the
      novel, you know, has sold a million, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow and Rachel were duly impressed by this prophecy of affluence,
      but Captain Zelotes still played the skeptic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A million at twenty-five cents a piece!&rdquo; exclaimed Olive. &ldquo;Why, Zelotes,
      that&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s an awful sight of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mental arithmetic failing her, she set to work with a pencil and paper and
      after a strenuous struggle triumphantly announced that it came to two
      hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul and body!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Two hundred and fifty thousand DOLLARS! My
      SOUL, Zelotes! Suppose&mdash;only suppose Albert&rsquo;s book brought him in as
      much as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Olive,&rdquo; he said, without looking up
      from his newspaper. &ldquo;My supposer wouldn&rsquo;t stand the strain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it might, Zelotes, it MIGHT. Suppose it did, what would you say
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain regarded her over the top of the Transcript. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t say
      a word, Olive,&rdquo; he answered, solemnly. &ldquo;I should be down sick by the time
      it got up as far as a thousand, and anything past two thousand you could
      use to buy my tombstone with. . . . There, there, Mother,&rdquo; he added,
      noticing the hurt look on her face, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel bad. I&rsquo;m only jokin&rsquo;. One
      of these days Al&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make a nice, comf&rsquo;table livin&rsquo; sellin&rsquo; lumber
      and hardware right here in South Harniss. I can SEE that money in the
      offin&rsquo;. All this million or two that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; from poetry and such is out
      of sight in the fog. It may be there but&mdash;humph! well, I KNOW where
      Z. Snow and Co. is located.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive was not entirely placated. &ldquo;I must say I think you&rsquo;re awful
      discouragin&rsquo; to the poor boy, Zelotes,&rdquo; she said. Her husband put down his
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I ain&rsquo;t, Mother,&rdquo; he replied, earnestly. &ldquo;At least I don&rsquo;t mean
      to be. Way I look at it, this poetry-makin&rsquo; and writin&rsquo; yarns and that
      sort of stuff is just part of the youngster&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;growin&rsquo; up,
      as you might say. Give him time he&rsquo;ll grow out of it, same as I cal&rsquo;late
      he will out of this girl business, this&mdash;er&mdash;Madel&mdash;humph&mdash;er&mdash;ahem.
      . . . Looks like a good day to-morrow, don&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled up suddenly, and with considerable confusion. He had kept the
      news of his grandson&rsquo;s infatuation and engagement even from his wife. No
      one in South Harniss knew of it, no one except the captain. Helen Kendall
      knew, but she was in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel Ellis picked up the half knitted Red Cross mitten in her lap.
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;s right or you are, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; she said,
      with a sigh, &ldquo;but this I do know&mdash;I wish this awful war was over and
      he was back home again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That remark ended the conversation. Olive resumed her own knitting, seeing
      it but indistinctly. Her husband did not continue his newspaper reading.
      Instead he rose and, saying something about cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; he would go for a
      little walk before turning in, went out into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the war did not end, it went on; so too did the enlisting and
      training. In the early summer Albert came home for a two days&rsquo; leave. He
      was broader and straighter and browner. His uniform became him and, more
      than ever, the eyes of South Harniss&rsquo;s youthful femininity, native or
      imported, followed him as he walked the village streets. But the glances
      were not returned, not in kind, that is. The new Fosdick home, although
      completed, was not occupied. Mrs. Fosdick had, that summer, decided that
      her duties as mover in goodness knows how many war work activities
      prevented her taking her &ldquo;usual summer rest.&rdquo; Instead she and Madeline
      occupied a rented villa at Greenwich, Connecticut, coming into town for
      meetings of all sorts. Captain Zelotes had his own suspicions as to
      whether war work alone was the cause of the Fosdicks&rsquo; shunning of what was
      to have been their summer home, but he kept those suspicions to himself.
      Albert may have suspected also, but he, too, said nothing. The censored
      correspondence between Greenwich and the training camp traveled regularly,
      and South Harniss damsels looked and longed in vain. He saw them, he bowed
      to them, he even addressed them pleasantly and charmingly, but to him they
      were merely incidents in his walks to and from the post-office. In his
      mind&rsquo;s eye he saw but one, and she, alas, was not present in the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned to the camp where, later on, Captain Zelotes and Olive
      visited him. As they came away the captain and his grandson exchanged a
      few significant words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is likely to be almost any time, Grandfather,&rdquo; said Albert, quietly.
      &ldquo;They are beginning to send them now, as you know by the papers, and we
      have had the tip that our turn will be soon. So&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote grasped the significance of the uncompleted sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, Al,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I see. Well, boy, I&mdash;I&mdash;Good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck, Grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all, that and one more handclasp. Our Anglo-Saxon inheritance
      descends upon us in times like these. The captain was silent for most of
      the ride to the railroad station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a long, significant interval during which there were no
      letters from the young soldier. After this a short reassuring cablegram
      from &ldquo;Somewhere in France.&rdquo; &ldquo;Safe. Well,&rdquo; it read and Olive Snow carried
      it about with her, in the bosom of her gown, all that afternoon and put it
      upon retiring on her bureau top so that she might see it the first thing
      in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another long interval, then letters, the reassuring but so tantalizingly
      unsatisfactory letters we American families were, just at that time,
      beginning to receive. Reading the newspapers now had a personal interest,
      a terrifying, dreadful interest. Then the packing and sending of holiday
      boxes, over the contents of which Olive and Rachel spent much careful
      planning and anxious preparation. Then another interval of more letters,
      letters which hinted vaguely at big things just ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then no letter for more than a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, one noon, as Captain Zelotes returned to his desk after the walk
      from home and dinner, Laban Keeler came in and stood beside that desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, looking up, saw the little bookkeeper&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What is it,
      Labe?&rdquo; he asked, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban held a yellow envelope in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came while you were gone to dinner, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ben Kelley
      fetched it from the telegraph office himself. He&mdash;he said he didn&rsquo;t
      hardly want to take it to the house. He cal&rsquo;lated you&rsquo;d better have it
      here, to read to yourself, fust. That&rsquo;s what he said&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what &lsquo;twas, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Captain Zelotes extended his hand for the envelope. He did not take
      his eyes from the bookkeeper&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben&mdash;Ben, he told me what was in it, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; faltered Laban. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what to say to you, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the captain took the envelope from Keeler&rsquo;s fingers, and
      tore it open. He read the words upon the form within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the Lord sakes, Lote Snow,&rdquo; he cried, in a burst of agony, &ldquo;why
      couldn&rsquo;t it have been some darn good-for-nothin&rsquo; like me instead&mdash;instead
      of him? Oh, my God A&rsquo;mighty, what a world this is! WHAT a world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Captain Zelotes said nothing. His eyes were fixed upon the yellow
      sheet of paper on the desk before him. After a long minute he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, very slowly, &ldquo;well, Labe, there goes&mdash;there goes Z.
      Snow and Company.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The telegram from the War Department was brief, as all such telegrams were
      perforce obliged to be. The Secretary of War, through his representative,
      regretted to inform Captain Zelotes Snow that Sergeant Albert Speranza had
      been killed in action upon a certain day. It was enough, however&mdash;for
      the time quite enough. It was not until later that the little group of
      South Harniss recovered sufficiently from the stunning effect of those few
      words to think of seeking particulars. Albert was dead; what did it
      matter, then, to know how he died?
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive bore the shock surprisingly well. Her husband&rsquo;s fears for her seemed
      quite unnecessary. The Captain, knowing how she had idolized her
      daughter&rsquo;s boy, had dreaded the effect which the news might have upon her.
      She was broken down by it, it is true, but she was quiet and brave&mdash;astonishingly,
      wonderfully quiet and brave. And it was she, rather than her husband, who
      played the part of the comforter in those black hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone, Zelotes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem possible, I know, but he&rsquo;s
      gone. And he died doin&rsquo; his duty, same as he would have wanted to die if
      he&rsquo;d known &lsquo;twas comin&rsquo;, poor boy. So&mdash;so we must do ours, I suppose,
      and bear up under it the very best we can. It won&rsquo;t be very long,
      Zelotes,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both gettin&rsquo; old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote made no reply. He was standing by the window of the
      sitting-room looking out into the wet backyard across which the
      wind-driven rain was beating in stormy gusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must be brave, Zelotes,&rdquo; whispered Olive, tremulously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d want us
      to be and we MUST be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm about her in a sudden heat of admiration. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be ashamed
      not to be after seein&rsquo; you, Mother,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out to the barn a few moments later and Rachel, entering the
      sitting-room, found Olive crumpled down in the big rocker in an agony of
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Mrs. Snow, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged, the tears streaming down her
      own cheeks. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t give way to it like this; you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, I know it,&rdquo; she admitted, chokingly, wiping her eyes with a
      soaked handkerchief. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t, Rachel, only this once, I promise you. You
      see I can&rsquo;t. I just can&rsquo;t on Zelotes&rsquo;s account. I&rsquo;ve got to bear up for
      his sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper was surprised and a little indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For his sake!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;For mercy sakes why for his sake? Is it any
      worse for him than &lsquo;tis for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, lots worse. He won&rsquo;t say much, of course, bein&rsquo; Zelotes
      Snow, but you and I know how he&rsquo;s planned, especially these last years,
      and how he&rsquo;s begun to count on&mdash;on Albert. . . . No, no, I ain&rsquo;t
      goin&rsquo; to cry, Rachel, I ain&rsquo;t&mdash;I WON&rsquo;T&mdash;but sayin&rsquo; his name, you
      know, kind of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know. Land sakes, DON&rsquo;T I know! Ain&rsquo;t I doin&rsquo; it myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course you are, Rachel. But we mustn&rsquo;t when Zelotes is around. We women,
      we&mdash;well, times like these women HAVE to keep up. What would become
      of the men if we didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she and Rachel &ldquo;kept up&rdquo; in public and when the captain was present,
      and he for his part made no show of grief nor asked for pity. He was
      silent, talked little and to the callers who came either at the house or
      office was uncomplaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died like a man,&rdquo; he told the Reverend Mr. Kendall when the latter
      called. &ldquo;He took his chance, knowin&rsquo; what that meant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was glad to take it,&rdquo; interrupted the minister. &ldquo;Proud and glad to
      take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. Why not? Wouldn&rsquo;t you or I have been glad to take ours, if we
      could?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Snow, I am glad to find you so resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes looked at him. &ldquo;Resigned?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What do you mean
      by resigned? Not to sit around and whimper is one thing&mdash;any decent
      man or woman ought to be able to do that in these days; but if by bein&rsquo; 
      resigned you mean I&rsquo;m contented to have it so&mdash;well, you&rsquo;re mistaken,
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only on one occasion, and then to Laban Keeler, did he open his shell
      sufficiently to give a glimpse of what was inside. Laban entered the inner
      office that morning to find his employer sitting in the desk chair, both
      hands jammed in his trousers&rsquo; pockets and his gaze fixed, apparently, upon
      the row of pigeon-holes. When the bookkeeper spoke to him he seemed to
      wake from a dream, for he started and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; began Keeler, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you, but that last
      carload of pine was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes waved his hand, brushing the carload of pine out of the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labe,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;did it seem to you that I was too hard on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban did not understand. &ldquo;Hard on him?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I
      just get&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard on Al. Did it seem to you as if I was a little too much of the bucko
      mate to the boy? Did I drive him too hard? Was I unreasonable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was prompt. &ldquo;No, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; replied Keeler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that? . . . Um-hm. . . . Well, sometimes seems as if I might
      have been. You see, Labe, when he first come I&mdash;Well, I cal&rsquo;late I
      was consider&rsquo;ble prejudiced against him. Account of his father, you
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. Sure. I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took me a good while to get reconciled to the Portygee streak in him.
      It chafed me consider&rsquo;ble to think there was a foreign streak in our
      family. The Snows have been straight Yankee for a good long while. . . .
      Fact is, I&mdash;I never got really reconciled to it. I kept bein&rsquo; fearful
      all the time that that streak, his father&rsquo;s streak, would break out in
      him. It never did, except of course in his poetry and that sort of
      foolishness, but I was always scared &lsquo;twould, you see. And now&mdash;now
      that this has happened I&mdash;I kind of fret for fear that I may have let
      my notions get ahead of my fair play. You think I did give the boy a
      square deal, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing, Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that. . . . And&mdash;and you cal&rsquo;late he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
      too prejudiced against me? I don&rsquo;t mean along at first, I mean this last
      year or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban hesitated. He wished his answer to be not an overstatement, but the
      exact truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis, &ldquo;that Al was comin&rsquo; to understand you
      better every day he lived, Cap&rsquo;n. Yes, and to think more and more of you,
      too. He was gettin&rsquo; older, for one thing&mdash;older, more of a man&mdash;yes,
      yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes smiled sadly. &ldquo;He was more boy than man by a good deal
      yet,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Well, Labe, he&rsquo;s gone and I&rsquo;m just beginnin&rsquo; to
      realize how much of life for me has gone along with him. He&rsquo;d been doin&rsquo; 
      better here in the office for the last two or three years, seemed to be
      catchin&rsquo; on to business better. Didn&rsquo;t you think so, Labe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. Yes indeed. Fust-rate, fust-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not first-rate. He was a long ways from a business man yet, but I did
      think he was doin&rsquo; a lot better. I could begin to see him pilotin&rsquo; this
      craft after I was called ashore. Now he&rsquo;s gone and . . . well, I don&rsquo;t see
      much use in my fightin&rsquo; to keep it afloat. I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; along in years&mdash;and
      what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Laban had ever heard Captain Zelotes refer to
      himself as an old man. It shocked him into sharp expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t old enough for the scrap heap by a
      big stretch. And besides, he made his fight, didn&rsquo;t he? He didn&rsquo;t quit, Al
      didn&rsquo;t, and he wouldn&rsquo;t want us to. No sir-ee, he wouldn&rsquo;t! No, sir, no! .
      . . I&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Cap&rsquo;n Lote. I&mdash;declare it must
      seem to you as if I was talkin&rsquo; pretty fresh. I swan I&rsquo;m sorry. I am so .
      . . sorry; yes, yes, I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain was not offended. He waved the apologies aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think it&rsquo;s worth while my fightin&rsquo; it out, do you, Labe?&rdquo; he
      asked, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s what you ought to do anyhow, whether it&rsquo;s worth
      while or not. The whole world&rsquo;s fightin&rsquo;. Uncle Sam&rsquo;s fightin&rsquo;. Al was
      fightin&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re fightin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m fightin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a darn sight easier to quit,
      a darn sight, but&mdash;but Al didn&rsquo;t quit. And&mdash;and we mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;not
      if we can help it,&rdquo; he added, drawing a hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      His agitation seemed to surprise Captain Zelotes. &ldquo;So all hands are
      fightin&rsquo;, are they, Labe,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Well, I presume likely there&rsquo;s
      some truth in that. What&rsquo;s your particular fight, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little bookkeeper looked at him for an instant before replying. The
      captain&rsquo;s question was kindly asked, but there was, or so Laban imagined,
      the faintest trace of sarcasm in its tone. That trace decided him. He
      leaned across the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My particular fight?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You&mdash;you want to know what &lsquo;tis,
      Cap&rsquo;n Lote? All right, all right, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting for further questioning and with, for him,
      surprisingly few repetitions, he told of his &ldquo;enlistment&rdquo; to fight John
      Barleycorn for the duration of the war. Captain Zelotes listened to the
      very end in silence. Laban mopped his forehead with a hand which shook
      much as it had done during the interview with Albert in the room above the
      shoe store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;there,&rdquo; he declared, in conclusion, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my fight, Cap&rsquo;n
      Lote. Al and I, we&mdash;we kind of went into it together, as you might
      say, though his enlistin&rsquo; was consider&rsquo;ble more heroic than mine&mdash;yes
      indeed, I should say so . . . yes, yes, yes. But I&rsquo;m fightin&rsquo; too . . . er
      . . . I&rsquo;m fightin&rsquo; too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes pulled his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the fight goin&rsquo;, Labe?&rdquo; he asked, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s kind of&mdash;kind of spotty, as you might say.
      There&rsquo;s spots when I get along fairly smooth and others when&mdash;well,
      when it&rsquo;s pretty rough goin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve had four hard spots since Al went away,
      but there&rsquo;s two that was the hardest. One was along Christmas and New Year
      time; you know I &lsquo;most generally had one of my&mdash;er&mdash;spells along
      about then. And t&rsquo;other is just now; I mean since we got word about&mdash;about
      Al. I don&rsquo;t suppose likely you surmised it, Cap&rsquo;n, but&mdash;but I&rsquo;d come
      to think a lot of that boy&mdash;yes, I had. Seems funny to you, I don&rsquo;t
      doubt, but it&rsquo;s so. And since the word come, you know&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;ve had some fight, some fight. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ve slept
      more&rsquo;n four hours in the last four nights&mdash;not more&rsquo;n that, no.
      Walkin&rsquo; helps me most, seems so. Last night I walked to West Orham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To West Orham! You WALKED there? Last NIGHT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Long&rsquo;s I can keep walkin&rsquo; I&mdash;I seem to part way forget&mdash;to
      forget the stuff, you know. When I&rsquo;m alone in my room I go &lsquo;most crazy&mdash;pretty
      nigh loony. . . . But there! I don&rsquo;t know why I got to talkin&rsquo; like this
      to you, Cap&rsquo;n Lote. You&rsquo;ve got your troubles and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Labe. Does Rachel know about your fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. No, no. Course she must notice how long I&rsquo;ve been&mdash;been
      straight, but I haven&rsquo;t told her. I want to be sure I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to win
      before I tell her. She&rsquo;s been disappointed times enough before, poor
      woman. . . . There, Cap&rsquo;n Lote, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it any more. Please
      don&rsquo;t get the notion that I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; for pity or anything like that. And
      don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m comparin&rsquo; what I call my fight to the real one like Al&rsquo;s.
      There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; much heroic about me, eh? No, no, I guess not. Tell that
      to look at me, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes rose and laid his big hand on his bookkeeper&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it, Labe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you. . . . And, I
      declare, I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself. . . . Humph! . . . Well, to-night you come
      home with me and have supper at the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, now, Cap&rsquo;n Lote&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do as I tell you. After supper, if there&rsquo;s any walkin&rsquo; to be done&mdash;if
      you take a notion to frog it to Orham or San Francisco or somewheres&mdash;maybe
      I&rsquo;ll go with you. Walkin&rsquo; may be good for my fight, too; you can&rsquo;t tell
      till you try. . . . There, don&rsquo;t argue, Labe. I&rsquo;m skipper of this craft
      yet and you&rsquo;ll obey my orders; d&rsquo;you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The day following the receipt of the fateful telegram the captain wrote a
      brief note to Fletcher Fosdick. A day or two later he received a reply.
      Fosdick&rsquo;s letter was kindly and deeply sympathetic. He had been greatly
      shocked and grieved by the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Speranza seemed to me, (he wrote) in my one short interview with
      him, to be a fine young fellow. Madeline, poor girl, is almost frantic.
      She will recover by and by, recovery is easier at her age, but it will be
      very, very hard for you and Mrs. Snow. You and I little thought when we
      discussed the problem of our young people that it would be solved in this
      way. To you and your wife my sincerest sympathy. When you hear particulars
      concerning your grandson&rsquo;s death, please write me. Madeline is anxious to
      know and keeps asking for them. Mrs. Fosdick is too much concerned with
      her daughter&rsquo;s health to write just now, but she joins me in sympathetic
      regards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes took Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s sympathy with a grain of salt. When he
      showed this letter to his wife he, for the first time, told her of the
      engagement, explaining that his previous silence had been due to Albert&rsquo;s
      request that the affair be kept a secret for the present. Olive, even in
      the depth of her sorrow, was greatly impressed by the grandeur of the
      alliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think, Zelotes,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;the Fosdick girl&mdash;and our
      Albert engaged to marry her! Why, the Fosdicks are awful rich, everybody
      says so. Mrs. Fosdick is head of I don&rsquo;t know how many societies and clubs
      and things in New York; her name is in the paper almost every day, so
      another New York woman told me at Red Cross meetin&rsquo; last summer. And Mr.
      Fosdick has been in politics, way up in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Well, he&rsquo;s reformed lately, I understand, so we mustn&rsquo;t hold that
      against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Zelotes, what DO you mean? How can you talk so? Just think what it
      would have meant to have our Albert marry a girl like Madeline Fosdick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain put his arm about her and gently patted her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Mother,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let that part of it fret
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Zelotes,&rdquo; tearfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. It would have been such a
      great thing for Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it? Well, maybe. Anyhow, there&rsquo;s no use worryin&rsquo; about it now. It&rsquo;s
      done with&mdash;ended and done with . . . same as a good many other plans
      that&rsquo;s been made in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes, don&rsquo;t speak like that, dear, so discouraged. It makes me feel
      worse than ever to hear you. And&mdash;and he wouldn&rsquo;t want you to, I&rsquo;m
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he? No, I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re right, Mother. We&rsquo;ll try not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other letters came, including one from Helen. It was not long. Mrs. Snow
      was a little inclined to feel hurt at its brevity. Her husband, however,
      did not share this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read it carefully, Mother?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have, Zelotes. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;well, I tell you, Mother, I&rsquo;ve read it three time. The first
      time I was like you; seemed to me as good a friend of Al and of us as
      Helen Kendall ought to have written more than that. The second time I read
      it I begun to wonder if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;, Mother, nothin&rsquo;. She says she&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to see us just as
      soon as she can get away for a day or two. She&rsquo;ll come, and when she does
      I cal&rsquo;late both you and I are goin&rsquo; to be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t she WRITE more, Zelotes? That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes tugged at his beard reflectively. &ldquo;When I wrote Fosdick
      the other day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t write more than a couple of pages. I
      was too upset to do it. I couldn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you are Albert&rsquo;s grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. And Helen&rsquo;s always . . . But there, Mother, don&rsquo;t you worry about
      Helen Kendall. I&rsquo;ve known her since she was born, pretty nigh, and <i>I</i>
      tell you she&rsquo;s all RIGHT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fosdick, in his letter, had asked for particulars concerning Albert&rsquo;s
      death. Those particulars were slow in coming. Captain Zelotes wrote at
      once to the War Department, but received little satisfaction. The
      Department would inform him as soon as it obtained the information. The
      name of Sergeant Albert Speranza had been cabled as one of a list of
      fatalities, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; as Rachel Ellis put it, &ldquo;that we never knew that he&rsquo;d been
      made a sergeant until after he was gone. He never had time to write it, I
      expect likely, poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first bit of additional information was furnished by the press. A
      correspondent of one of the Boston dailies sent a brief dispatch to his
      paper describing the fighting at a certain point on the Allied front. A
      small detachment of American troops had taken part, with the French, in an
      attack on a village held by the enemy. The enthusiastic reporter declared
      it to be one of the smartest little actions in which our soldiers had so
      far taken part and was eloquent concerning the bravery and dash of his
      fellow countrymen. &ldquo;They proved themselves,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and French
      officers with whom I have talked are enthusiastic. Our losses, considering
      the number engaged, are said to be heavy. Among those reported as killed
      is Sergeant Albert Speranza, a Massachusetts boy whom American readers
      will remember as a writer of poetry and magazine fiction. Sergeant
      Speranza is said to have led his company in the capture of the village and
      to have acted with distinguished bravery.&rdquo; The editor of the Boston paper
      who first read this dispatch turned to his associate at the next desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speranza? . . . Speranza?&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Say, Jim, wasn&rsquo;t it Albert
      Speranza who wrote that corking poem we published after the Lusitania was
      sunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim looked up. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has written a lot of pretty good stuff
      since, too. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just been killed in action over there, so Conway says in this
      dispatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? . . . Humph! . . . Any particulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. &lsquo;Distinguished bravery,&rsquo; according to Conway. Couldn&rsquo;t we have
      something done in the way of a Sunday special? He was a Massachusetts
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might. We haven&rsquo;t a photograph, have we? If we haven&rsquo;t, perhaps we can
      get one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The photograph was obtained&mdash;bribery and corruption of the Orham
      photographer&mdash;and, accompanied by a reprint of the Lusitania poem,
      appeared in the &ldquo;Magazine Section&rdquo; of the Sunday newspaper. With these
      also appeared a short notice of the young poet&rsquo;s death in the service of
      his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the beginning. At the middle of that week Conway sent another
      dispatch. The editor who received it took it into the office of the Sunday
      editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here are more particulars about that young chap Speranza,
      the one we printed the special about last Sunday. He must have been a
      corker. When his lieutenant was put out of business by a shrapnel this
      Speranza chap rallied the men and jammed &lsquo;em through the Huns like a hot
      knife through butter. Killed the German officer and took three prisoners
      all by himself. Carried his wounded lieutenant to the rear on his
      shoulders, too. Then he went back into the ruins to get another wounded
      man and was blown to slivers by a hand grenade. He&rsquo;s been cited in orders
      and will probably be decorated by the French&mdash;that is, his memory
      will be. Pretty good for a poet, I&rsquo;d say. No &lsquo;lilies and languors&rsquo; about
      that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday editor nodded approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great stuff!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Let me have that dispatch, will you, when
      you&rsquo;ve finished. I&rsquo;ve just discovered that this young Speranza&rsquo;s father
      was Speranza, the opera baritone. You remember him? And his mother was the
      daughter of a Cape Cod sea captain. How&rsquo;s that? Spain, Cape Cod, opera,
      poetry and the Croix de Guerre. And have you looked at the young fellow&rsquo;s
      photograph? Combination of Adonis and &lsquo;Romeo, where art thou.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve had no
      less than twenty letters about him and his poetry already. Next Sunday
      we&rsquo;ll have a special &lsquo;as is.&rsquo; Where can I get hold of a lot of his poems?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;special as was&rdquo; occupied an entire page. A reporter had visited South
      Harniss and had taken photographs of the Snow place and some of its
      occupants. Captain Zelotes had refused to pose, but there was a view of
      the building and yards of &ldquo;Z. Snow and Co.&rdquo; with the picturesque figure of
      Mr. Issachar Price tastefully draped against a pile of boards in the right
      foreground. Issy had been a find for the reporter; he supplied the latter
      with every fact concerning Albert which he could remember and some that he
      invented on the spur of the moment. According to Issy, Albert was &ldquo;a fine,
      fust-class young feller. Him and me was like brothers, as you might say.
      When he got into trouble, or was undecided or anything, he&rsquo;d come to me
      for advice and I always gave it to him. Land, yes! I always give to
      Albert. No matter how busy I was I always stopped work to help HIM out.&rdquo;
       The reporter added that Mr. Price stopped work even while speaking of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The special attracted the notice of other newspaper editors. This skirmish
      in which Albert had taken so gallant part was among the first in which our
      soldiers had participated. So the story was copied and recopied. The tale
      of the death of the young poet, the &ldquo;happy warrior,&rdquo; as some writer called
      him, was spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Canada to the
      Gulf. And just at this psychological moment the New York publisher brought
      out the long deferred volume. The Lances of Dawn, Being the Collected
      Poems of Albert M. C. Speranza, such was its title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, or, rather, within the week when the Lances of Dawn flashed
      upon the public, Captain Zelotes received a letter from the captain of
      Albert&rsquo;s regiment in France. It was not a long letter, for the captain was
      a busy man, but it was the kindly, sympathetic letter of one who was,
      literally, that well-advertised combination, an officer and a gentleman.
      It told of Albert&rsquo;s promotion to the rank of sergeant, &ldquo;a promotion which,
      had the boy been spared, would, I am sure, have been the forerunner of
      others.&rdquo; It told of that last fight, the struggle for the village, of
      Sergeant Speranza&rsquo;s coolness and daring and of his rush back into the
      throat of death to save a wounded comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men tell me they tried to stop him (wrote the captain). He was himself
      slightly wounded, he had just brought Lieutenant Stacey back to safety and
      the enemy at that moment was again advancing through the village. But he
      insisted upon going. The man he was trying to rescue was a private in his
      company and the pair were great friends. So he started back alone,
      although several followed him a moment later. They saw him enter the
      ruined cottage where his friend lay. Then a party of the enemy appeared at
      the corner and flung grenades. The entire side of the cottage which he had
      just entered was blown in and the Germans passed on over it, causing our
      men to fall back temporarily. We retook the place within half an hour.
      Private Kelly&rsquo;s body&mdash;it was Private Kelly whom Sergeant Speranza was
      attempting to rescue&mdash;was found and another, badly disfigured, which
      was at first supposed to be that of your grandson. But this body was
      subsequently identified as that of a private named Hamlin who was killed
      when the enemy first charged. Sergeant Speranza&rsquo;s body is still missing,
      but is thought to be buried beneath the ruins of the cottage. These ruins
      were subsequently blown into further chaos by a high explosive shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed more expressions of regret and sympathy and confirmation of
      the report concerning citation and the war cross. Captain Lote read the
      letter at first alone in his private office. Then he brought it home and
      gave it to his wife to read. Afterward he read it aloud to Mrs. Ellis and
      to Laban, who was making his usual call in the Snow kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reading was ended Labe was the first to speak. His eyes were
      shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfreys!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Godfreys, Cap&rsquo;n Lote!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain seemed to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Labe,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s made us proud of him. . . .
      Prouder than some of us are of ourselves, I cal&rsquo;late,&rdquo; he added, rising
      and moving toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho, sho, Cap&rsquo;n, you mustn&rsquo;t feel that way. No, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! . . . Labe, I presume likely if I was a pious man, one of the
      old-fashioned kind of pious, and believed the Almighty went out of his way
      to get square with any human bein&rsquo; that made a mistake or didn&rsquo;t do the
      right thing&mdash;if I believed that I might figger all this was a sort of
      special judgment on me for my prejudices, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler was much disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense, Cap&rsquo;n Lote!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t fair to
      yourself. You never treated Al anyhow but just honest and fair and square.
      If he was here now instead of layin&rsquo; dead over there in France, poor
      feller, he&rsquo;d say so, too. Yes, he would. Course he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain made no reply, but walked from the room. Laban turned to Mrs.
      Ellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old man broods over that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish. . . . Eh? What&rsquo;s the
      matter, Rachel? What are you lookin&rsquo; at me like that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper was leaning forward in her chair, her cheeks flushed and
      her hands clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; she asked, in a mysterious whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? How do I know who&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert. How do you know he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know he&rsquo;s DEAD!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;How do I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; impatiently; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I said. Don&rsquo;t run it over three
      or four times more. How do you know Albert&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Rachel, what kind of talk&rsquo;s that? I know he&rsquo;s dead because the
      newspapers say so, and the War Department folks say so, and this cap&rsquo;n man
      in France that was right there at the time, HE says so. All hands say so&mdash;yes,
      yes. So don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! I don&rsquo;t care if they all say so ten times over. How do they KNOW?
      They ain&rsquo;t found him dead, have they? The report from the War Department
      folks was sent when they thought that other body was Albert&rsquo;s. Now they
      know that wasn&rsquo;t him. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, under the ruins of that cottage. &lsquo;Twas all blown to pieces and most
      likely&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. There you are! &lsquo;Most likely!&rsquo; Well, I ain&rsquo;t satisfied with most
      likelys. I want to KNOW.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laban Keeler, until they find his body I shan&rsquo;t believe Albert&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Rachel, you mustn&rsquo;t try to deceive yourself that way. Don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see. Labe, when Robert Penfold was lost and gone for all them
      months all hands thought he was dead, didn&rsquo;t they? But he wasn&rsquo;t; he was
      on that island lost in the middle of all creation. What&rsquo;s to hinder Albert
      bein&rsquo; took prisoner by those Germans? They came back to that cottage place
      after Albert was left there, the cap&rsquo;n says so in that letter Cap&rsquo;n Lote
      just read. What&rsquo;s to hinder their carryin&rsquo; Al off with &lsquo;em? Eh? What&rsquo;s to
      hinder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, nothin&rsquo;, I suppose, in one way. But nine chances out of
      ten&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That leaves one chance, don&rsquo;t it. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to give up that chance
      for&mdash;for my boy. I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, Labe, I did think SO much of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Rachel, I know. Don&rsquo;t cry any more than you can help. And if it
      helps you any to make believe&mdash;I mean to keep on hopin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s alive
      somewheres&mdash;why, do it. It won&rsquo;t do any harm, I suppose. Only I
      wouldn&rsquo;t hint such a thing to Cap&rsquo;n Lote or Olive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t quite a fool, I hope. . . . And I
      presume likely you&rsquo;re right, Laban. The poor boy is dead, probably. But I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; to hope he isn&rsquo;t, anyhow, just to get what comfort I can from it.
      And Robert Penfold did come back, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time Laban found himself, against all reason, asking the very
      question Rachel had asked: Did they actually KNOW that Albert was dead?
      But as the months passed and no news came he ceased to ask it. Whenever he
      mentioned the subject to the housekeeper her invariable reply was: &ldquo;But
      they haven&rsquo;t found his body, have they?&rdquo; She would not give up that tenth
      chance. As she seemed to find some comfort in it he did not attempt to
      convince her of its futility.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, meanwhile The Lances of Dawn, Being the Collected Poems of Albert M.
      C. Speranza was making a mild sensation. The critics were surprisingly
      kind to it. The story of the young author&rsquo;s recent and romantic death, of
      his gallantry, his handsome features displayed in newspapers everywhere,
      all these helped toward the generous welcome accorded the little volume.
      If the verses were not inspired&mdash;why, they were at least entertaining
      and pleasant. And youth, high-hearted youth sang on every page. So the
      reviewers were kind and forbearing to the poems themselves, and, for the
      sake of the dead soldier-poet, were often enthusiastic. The book sold, for
      a volume of poems it sold very well indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Snow place in South Harniss pride and tears mingled. Olive read the
      verses over and over again, and wept as she read. Rachel Ellis learned
      many of them by heart, but she, too, wept as she recited them to herself
      or to Laban. In the little bookkeeper&rsquo;s room above Simond&rsquo;s shoe store The
      Lances of Dawn lay under the lamp upon the center table as before a
      shrine. Captain Zelotes read the verses. Also he read all the newspaper
      notices which, sent to the family by Helen Kendall, were promptly held
      before his eyes by Olive and Rachel. He read the publisher&rsquo;s
      advertisements, he read the reviews. And the more he read the more puzzled
      and bewildered he became.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it, Laban,&rdquo; he confided in deep distress to Mr.
      Keeler. &ldquo;I give in I don&rsquo;t know anything at all about this. I&rsquo;m clean off
      soundin&rsquo;s. If all this newspaper stuff is so Albert was right all the time
      and I was plumb wrong. Here&rsquo;s this feller,&rdquo; picking up a clipping from the
      desk, &ldquo;callin&rsquo; him a genius and &lsquo;a gifted youth&rsquo; and the land knows what.
      And every day or so I get a letter from somebody I never heard of tellin&rsquo; 
      me what a comfort to &lsquo;em those poetry pieces of his are. I don&rsquo;t
      understand it, Labe. It worries me. If all this is true then&mdash;then I
      was all wrong. I tried to keep him from makin&rsquo; up poetry, Labe&mdash;TRIED
      to, I did. If what these folks say is so somethin&rsquo; ought to be done to me.
      I&mdash;I&mdash;by thunder, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I hadn&rsquo;t ought to be hung! . .
      . And yet&mdash;and yet, I did what I thought was right and did it for the
      boy&rsquo;s sake . . . And&mdash;and even now I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t sartin I was
      wrong. But if I wasn&rsquo;t wrong then this is . . . Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And not only in South Harniss were there changes of heart. In New York
      City and at Greenwich where Mrs. Fosdick was more than ever busy with war
      work, there were changes. When the newspaper accounts of young Speranza&rsquo;s
      heroic death were first published the lady paid little attention to them.
      Her daughter needed all her care just then&mdash;all the care, that is,
      which she could spare from her duties as president of this society and
      corresponding secretary of that. If her feelings upon hearing the news
      could have been analyzed it is probable that their larger proportion would
      have been a huge sense of relief. THAT problem was solved, at all events.
      She was sorry for poor Madeline, of course, but the dear child was but a
      child and would recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as with more and more intensity the limelight of publicity was turned
      upon Albert Speranza&rsquo;s life and death and writing, the wife of the
      Honorable Fletcher Fosdick could not but be impressed. As head of several
      so-called literary societies, societies rather neglected since the
      outbreak of hostilities, she had made it her business to hunt literary
      lions. Recently it was true that military lions&mdash;Major Vermicelli of
      the Roumanian light cavalry, or Private Drinkwater of the Tank Corps&mdash;were
      more in demand than Tagores, but, as Mrs. Fosdick read of Sergeant
      Speranza&rsquo;s perils and poems, it could not help occurring to her that here
      was a lion both literary and martial. Decidedly she had not approved of
      her daughter&rsquo;s engagement to that lion, but now the said lion was dead,
      which rendered him a perfectly harmless yet not the less fascinating
      animal. And then appeared The Lances of Dawn and Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s friends
      among the elect began to read and talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the change came. Those friends, one by one, individuals
      judiciously chosen, were told in strict confidence of poor Madeline&rsquo;s
      romantic love affair and its tragic ending. These individuals, chosen
      judiciously as has been stated, whispered, also in strict confidence, the
      tale to other friends and acquaintances. Mrs. Fosdick began to receive
      condolences on her daughter&rsquo;s account and on her own. Soon she began to
      speak publicly of &ldquo;My poor, dear daughter&rsquo;s dead fiance. Such a loss to
      American literature. Sheer genius. Have you read the article in the
      Timepiece? Madeline, poor girl, is heartbroken, naturally, but very proud,
      even in the midst of her grief. So are we all, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quoted liberally from The Lances of Dawn. A copy specially bound, lay
      upon her library table. Albert&rsquo;s photograph in uniform, obtained from the
      Snows by Mr. Fosdick, who wrote for it at his wife&rsquo;s request, stood beside
      it. To callers and sister war workers Mrs. Fosdick gave details of the
      hero&rsquo;s genius, his bravery, his devotion to her daughter. It was all so
      romantic and pleasantly self-advertising&mdash;and perfectly safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer came again, the summer of 1918. The newspapers now were gravely
      personal reading to millions of Americans. Our new army was trying its
      metal on the French front and with the British against the vaunted
      Hindenburg Line. The transports were carrying thousands on every trip to
      join those already &ldquo;over there.&rdquo; In South Harniss and in Greenwich and New
      York, as in every town and city, the ordinary summer vacations and
      playtime occupations were forgotten or neglected and war charities and war
      labors took their place. Other soldiers than Sergeant Speranza were the
      newspaper heroes now, other books than The Lances of Dawn talked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      As on the previous summer the new Fosdick cottage was not occupied by its
      owners. Mrs. Fosdick was absorbed by her multitudinous war duties and her
      husband was at Washington giving his counsel and labor to the cause.
      Captain Zelotes bought to his last spare dollar of each successive issue
      of Liberty Bonds, and gave that dollar to the Red Cross or the Y. M. C.
      A.; Laban and Rachel did likewise. Even Issachar Price bought Thrift
      Stamps and exhibited them to anyone who would stop long enough to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By crimus,&rdquo; declared Issy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m makin&rsquo; myself poor helpin&rsquo; out the
      gov&rsquo;ment, but let &lsquo;er go and darn the Kaiser, that&rsquo;s my motto. But they
      ain&rsquo;t all like me. I was down to the drug store yesterday and old man
      Burgess had the cheek to tell me I owed him for some cigars I bought&mdash;er&mdash;last
      fall, seems to me &lsquo;twas. I turned right around and looked at him&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got my opinion,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;of a man that thinks of cigars and such luxuries
      when the country needs every cent. What have you got that gov&rsquo;ment poster
      stuck up on your wall for?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Read it,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;It says&rsquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;Save!
      Save! Save!&rdquo;&rsquo; don&rsquo;t it? All right. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;M doin&rsquo;. I AM savin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
      Then when he was thinkin&rsquo; of somethin&rsquo; to answer back I walked right out
      and left him. Yes sir, by crimustee, I left him right where he stood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      August came; September&mdash;the Hindenburg Line was broken. Each day the
      triumphant headlines in the papers were big and black and also, alas, the
      casualty lists on the inside pages long and longer. Then October. The
      armistice was signed. It was the end. The Allied world went wild, cheered,
      danced, celebrated. Then it sat back, thinking, thanking God, solemnly
      trying to realize that the killing days, the frightful days of waiting and
      awful anxiety, were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And early in November another telegram came to the office of Z. Snow and
      Co. This time it came, not from the War Department direct, but from the
      Boston headquarters of the American Red Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this time, just as on the day when the other fateful telegram came,
      Laban Keeler was the first of the office regulars to learn its contents.
      Ben Kelley himself brought this message, just as he had brought that
      telling of Albert Speranza&rsquo;s death. And the usually stolid Ben was greatly
      excited. He strode straight from the door to the bookkeeper&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the old man in, Labe?&rdquo; he whispered, jerking his head toward the
      private office, the door of which happened to be shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laban looked at him over his spectacles. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Lote, you mean?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in. But he don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed&mdash;no, no. Goin&rsquo; to
      write a couple of important letters, he said. Important ones. . . . Um-hm.
      What is it, Ben? Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelley did not answer that question. Instead he took a telegram from his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, Labe,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Read it. It&rsquo;s the darndest news&mdash;the&mdash;the
      darnedest good news ever you heard in your life. It don&rsquo;t seem as if it
      could he, but, by time, I guess &lsquo;tis. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s from the Red Cross
      folks and they&rsquo;d ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban stared at the telegram. It was not in the usual envelope; Kelley had
      been too anxious to bring it to its destination to bother with an
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; commanded the operator again. &ldquo;See if you think Cap&rsquo;n Lote
      ought to have it broke easy to him or&mdash;or what? Read it, I tell you.
      Lord sakes, it&rsquo;s no secret! I hollered it right out loud when it come in
      over the wire and the gang at the depot heard it. They know it and it&rsquo;ll
      be all over town in ten minutes. READ IT.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keeler read the telegram. His florid cheeks turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord above!&rdquo; he exclaimed, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? I bet you! Shall I take it to the cap&rsquo;n? Eh? What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. . . . Wait . . . I&mdash;I&mdash;My soul! My soul! Why . . . It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      true. . . . And Rachel always said . . . Why, she was right . . . I . . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From without came the sound of running feet and a series of yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labe! Labe!&rdquo; shrieked Issy. &ldquo;Oh, my crimus! . . . Labe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst into the office, his eyes and mouth wide open and his hands
      waving wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labe! Labe!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;Have you heard it? Have you? It&rsquo;s true,
      too. He&rsquo;s alive! He&rsquo;s alive! He&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban sprang from his stool. &ldquo;Shut up, Is!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Shut up! Hold
      on! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s alive, I tell you! He ain&rsquo;t dead! He ain&rsquo;t never been dead! Oh,
      my crimus! . . . Hey, Cap&rsquo;n Lote! HE&rsquo;S ALIVE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes was standing in the doorway of the private office. The
      noise had aroused him from his letter writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s alive? What&rsquo;s the matter with you this time, Is?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Issy,&rdquo; ordered Laban, seizing the frantic Mr. Price by the
      collar. &ldquo;Be still! Wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still? What do I want to be still for? I cal&rsquo;late Cap&rsquo;n Lote&rsquo;ll holler
      some, too, when he hears. He&rsquo;s alive, Cap&rsquo;n Lote, I tell ye. Let go of me,
      Labe Keeler! He&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s alive? What is it? Labe, YOU answer me. Who&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban&rsquo;s thoughts were still in a whirl. He was still shaking from the news
      the telegraph operator had brought. Rachel Ellis was at that moment in his
      mind and he answered as she might have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;Robert Penfold,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert PENFOLD! What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issachar could hold in no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert Penfold nawthin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Who in thunder&rsquo;s he? &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
      Robert Penfold nor Robert Penholder neither. It&rsquo;s Al Speranza, that&rsquo;s who
      &lsquo;tis. He ain&rsquo;t killed, Cap&rsquo;n Lote. He&rsquo;s alive and he&rsquo;s been alive all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelley stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if &lsquo;twas so, Cap&rsquo;n Snow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the telegram from the
      Red Cross.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was nothing miraculous about it. That is to say, it was no more of a
      miracle than hundreds of similar cases in the World War. The papers of
      those years were constantly printing stories of men over whose supposed
      graves funeral sermons had been preached, to whose heirs insurance
      payments had been made, in whose memory grateful communities had made
      speeches and delivered eulogiums&mdash;the papers were telling of instance
      after instance of those men being discovered alive and in the flesh, as
      casuals in some French hospital or as inmates of German prison camps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel Ellis had asked what was to hinder Albert&rsquo;s having been taken
      prisoner by the Germans and carried off by them. As a matter of fact
      nothing had hindered and that was exactly what had happened. Sergeant
      Speranza, wounded by machine gun fire and again by the explosion of the
      grenade, was found in the ruins of the cottage when the detachment of the
      enemy captured it. He was conscious and able to speak, so instead of being
      bayonetted was carried to the rear where he might be questioned concerning
      the American forces. The questioning was most unsatisfactory to the
      Prussian officers who conducted it. Albert fainted, recovered
      consciousness and fainted again. So at last the Yankee swine was left to
      die or get well and his Prussian interrogators went about other business,
      the business of escaping capture themselves. But when they retreated the
      few prisoners, mostly wounded men, were taken with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s recollections of the next few days were hazy and very doubtful.
      Pain, pain and more pain. Hours and hours&mdash;they seemed like years&mdash;of
      jolting over rough roads. Pawing-over by a fat, bearded surgeon, who may
      not have been intentionally brutal, but quite as likely may. A great
      desire to die, punctuated by occasional feeble spurts of wishing to live.
      Then more surgical man-handling, more jolting&mdash;in freight cars this
      time&mdash;a slow, miserable recovery, nurses who hated their patients and
      treated them as if they did, then, a prison camp, a German prison camp.
      Then horrors and starvation and brutality lasting many months. Then fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wandering in that misty land between this world and the next when,
      the armistice having been signed, an American Red Cross representative
      found him. In the interval between fits of delirium he told this man his
      name and regiment and, later, the name of his grandparents. When it seemed
      sure that he was to recover the Red Cross representative cabled the facts
      to this country. And, still later, those facts, or the all-important fact
      that Sergeant Albert M. C. Speranza was not dead but alive, came by
      telegraph to Captain Zelotes Snow of South Harniss. And, two months after
      that, Captain Zelotes himself, standing on the wharf in Boston and peering
      up at a crowded deck above him, saw the face of his grandson, that face
      which he had never expected to see again, looking eagerly down upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more weeks and it was over. The brief interval of camp life and the
      mustering out were things of the past. Captain Lote and Albert, seated in
      the train, were on their way down the Cape, bound home. Home! The word had
      a significance now which it never had before. Home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert drew a long breath. &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;By George,
      Grandfather, this looks good to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might not have looked as good to another person. It was raining, the
      long stretches of salt marsh were windswept and brown and bleak. In the
      distance Cape Cod Bay showed gray and white against a leaden sky. The
      drops ran down the dingy car windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes understood, however. He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It used to look good to me when I was bound home after a v&rsquo;yage,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;Well, son, I cal&rsquo;late your grandma and Rachel are up to the
      depot by this time waitin&rsquo; for you. We ain&rsquo;t due for pretty nigh an hour
      yet, but I&rsquo;d be willin&rsquo; to bet they&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;My, I do want to see them!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a mite if they wanted to see you, boy. Well, I&rsquo;m kind of
      glad I shooed that reception committee out of the way. I presumed likely
      you&rsquo;d rather have your first day home to yourself&mdash;and us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so! Newspaper reporters are a lot of mighty good fellows,
      but I hope I never see another one. . . . That&rsquo;s rather ungrateful, I
      know,&rdquo; he added, with a smile, &ldquo;but I mean it&mdash;just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had some excuse for meaning it. The death of Albert Speranza, poet and
      warrior, had made a newspaper sensation. His resurrection and return
      furnished material for another. Captain Zelotes was not the only person to
      meet the transport at the pier; a delegation of reporters was there also.
      Photographs of Sergeant Speranza appeared once more in print. This time,
      however, they were snapshots showing him in uniform, likenesses of a still
      handsome, but less boyish young man, thinner, a scar upon his right cheek,
      and the look in his eyes more serious, and infinitely older, the look of
      one who had borne much and seen more. The reporters found it difficult to
      get a story from the returned hero. He seemed to shun the limelight and to
      be almost unduly modest and retiring, which was of itself, had they but
      known it, a transformation sufficiently marvelous to have warranted a
      special &ldquo;Sunday special.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not talk about himself,&rdquo; so one writer headed his article. Gertie
      Kendrick, with a brand-new ring upon her engagement finger, sniffed as she
      read that headline to Sam Thatcher, who had purchased the ring. &ldquo;Al
      Speranza won&rsquo;t talk about himself!&rdquo; exclaimed Gertie. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the
      FIRST time, then. No wonder they put it in the paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Albert would not talk, claiming that he had done nothing worth talking
      about, except to get himself taken prisoner in almost his first
      engagement. &ldquo;Go and ask some of the other fellows aboard here,&rdquo; he urged.
      &ldquo;They have been all through it.&rdquo; As he would not talk the newspaper men
      were obliged to talk for him, which they did by describing his appearance
      and his manner, and by rehashing the story of the fight in the French
      village. Also, of course, they republished some of his verses. The Lances
      of Dawn appeared in a special edition in honor of its author&rsquo;s
      reappearance on this earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; continued Captain Zelotes, &ldquo;the reception committee was
      consider&rsquo;ble disappointed. They&rsquo;d have met you with the Orham band if
      they&rsquo;d had their way. I told &lsquo;em you&rsquo;d heard all the band music you wanted
      in camp, I guessed likely, and you&rsquo;d rather come home quiet. There was
      goin&rsquo; to be some speeches, too, but I had them put off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. I had a notion you wouldn&rsquo;t hanker for speeches. If you do Issy&rsquo;ll
      make one for you &lsquo;most any time. Ever since you got into the papers Issy&rsquo;s
      been swellin&rsquo; up like a hot pop-over with pride because you and he was
      what he calls chummies. All last summer Issachar spent his evenin&rsquo;s
      hangin&rsquo; around the hotel waitin&rsquo; for the next boarder to mention your
      name. Sure as one did Is was ready for him. &lsquo;Know him?&rsquo; he&rsquo;d sing out.
      &lsquo;Did I know Al Speranza? ME? Well, now say!&mdash;&rsquo; And so on, long as the
      feller would listen. I asked him once if he ever told any of &lsquo;em how you
      ducked him with the bucket of water. He didn&rsquo;t think I knew about that and
      it kind of surprised him, I judged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;Laban told you about it, I suppose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a kid
      trick that was, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain turned his head and regarded him for an instant. The old
      twinkle was in his eye when he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing like that now, Al, I presume likely?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Feel
      a good deal older now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s answer was seriously given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I feel at least a hundred and fifty,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! . . . Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel like that. If you&rsquo;re a hundred and
      fifty I must be a little older than Methuselah was in his last years. I&rsquo;m
      feelin&rsquo; younger to-day, younger than I have for quite a spell. Yes, for
      quite a spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandson put a hand on his knee. &ldquo;Good for you, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Now tell me more about Labe. Do you know I think the old chap&rsquo;s sticking
      by his pledge is the bulliest thing I&rsquo;ve heard since I&rsquo;ve been home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they talked of Laban and of Rachel and of South Harniss happenings
      until the train drew up at the platform of that station. And upon that
      platform stepped Albert to feel his grandmother&rsquo;s arms about him and her
      voice, tremulous with happiness, at his ear. And behind her loomed Mrs.
      Ellis, her ample face a combination of smiles and tears, &ldquo;all sunshine and
      fair weather down below but rainin&rsquo; steady up aloft,&rdquo; as Captain Lote
      described it afterwards. And behind her, like a foothill in the shadow of
      a mountain, was Laban. And behind Laban&mdash;No, that is a mistake&mdash;in
      front of Laban and beside Laban and in front of and beside everyone else
      when opportunity presented was Issachar. And Issachar&rsquo;s expression and
      bearings were wonderful to see. A stranger, and there were several
      strangers amid the group at the station, might have gained the impression
      that Mr. Price, with of course a very little help from the Almighty, was
      responsible for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Issy!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert, when they shook hands. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here, too,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price&rsquo;s already protuberant chest swelled still further. His reply had
      the calmness of finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Issy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to look out for Z. Snow and
      Co. if all hands walks out and leaves &lsquo;em?&rsquo; Labe says. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; 
      says I, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to that depot to meet Al Speranzy and
      if Z. Snow and Co. goes to pot while I&rsquo;m gone I can&rsquo;t help it. I have
      sacrificed,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;and I stand ready to sacrifice pretty nigh
      everything for my business, but there&rsquo;s limits and this is one of &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; acrost to that depot to meet him,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t you try to
      stop me, Labe Keeler.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great stuff, Is!&rdquo; said Albert, with a laugh. &ldquo;What did Labe say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was there for him to say? He could see I meant it. Course he hove
      out some of his cheap talk, but it didn&rsquo;t amount to nothin&rsquo;. Asked if I
      wan&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to put up a sign sayin&rsquo; when I&rsquo;d be back, so&rsquo;s to ease the
      customers&rsquo; minds. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll be back,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; 
      says he, &lsquo;put that on the sign. That&rsquo;ll ease &lsquo;em still more.&rsquo; Just cheap
      talk &lsquo;twas. He thinks he&rsquo;s funny, but I don&rsquo;t pay no attention to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others came to shake hands and voice a welcome. The formal reception, that
      with the band, had been called off at Captain Zelotes&rsquo;s request, but the
      informal one was, in spite of the rain, which was now much less heavy,
      quite a sizable gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Mr. Kendall held his hand for a long time and talked much, it
      seemed to Albert that he had aged greatly since they last met. He wandered
      a bit in his remarks and repeated himself several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor old gentleman&rsquo;s failin&rsquo; a good deal, Albert,&rdquo; said Mrs. Snow, as
      they drove home together, he and his grandparents, three on the seat of
      the buggy behind Jessamine. &ldquo;His sermons are pretty tiresome nowadays, but
      we put up with &lsquo;em because he&rsquo;s been with us so long. . . . Ain&rsquo;t you
      squeezed &lsquo;most to death, Albert? You two big men and me all mashed
      together on this narrow seat. It&rsquo;s lucky I&rsquo;m small. Zelotes ought to get a
      two-seated carriage, but he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next thing I get, Mother,&rdquo; observed the captain, &ldquo;will be an automobile.
      I&rsquo;ll stick to the old mare here as long as she&rsquo;s able to navigate, but
      when she has to be hauled out of commission I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to buy a car. I
      believe I&rsquo;m pretty nigh the last man in this county to drive a horse, as
      &lsquo;tis. Makes me feel like what Sol Dadgett calls a cracked teapot&mdash;a
      &lsquo;genuine antique.&rsquo; One of these city women will be collectin&rsquo; me some of
      these days. Better look out, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive sighed happily. &ldquo;It does me good to hear you joke again, Zelotes,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t joke much, Albert, while&mdash;when we thought you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert interrupted in time to prevent the threatened shower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Kendall is not well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you would be. You and he used to be so friendly when Helen was
      home. Oh, speakin&rsquo; of Helen, she IS comin&rsquo; home in a fortni&rsquo;t or three
      weeks, so I hear. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to give up her teachin&rsquo; and come back to be
      company for her father. I suppose she realizes he needs her, but it must
      be a big sacrifice for her, givin&rsquo; up the good position she&rsquo;s got now.
      She&rsquo;s such a smart girl and such a nice one. Why, she came to see us after
      the news came&mdash;the bad news&mdash;and she was so kind and so good. I
      don&rsquo;t know what we should have done without her. Zelotes says so too,
      don&rsquo;t you, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband did not answer. Instead he said: &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s home, Al.
      Rachel&rsquo;s there ahead of us and dinner&rsquo;s on the way, judgin&rsquo; by the smoke
      from the kitchen chimney. How does the old place look to you, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert merely shook his head and drew a long breath, but his grandparents
      seemed to be quite satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were letters and telegrams awaiting him on the table in the
      sitting-room. Two of the letters were postmarked from a town on the
      Florida coast. The telegram also was from that same town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> had one of those things,&rdquo; observed Captain Zelotes, alluding to
      the telegram. &ldquo;Fosdick sent me one of those long ones, night-letters I
      believe they call &lsquo;em. He wants me to tell you that Mrs. Fosdick is better
      and that they cal&rsquo;late to be in New York before very long and shall expect
      you there. Of course you knew that, Al, but I presume likely the main idea
      of the telegram was to help say, &lsquo;Welcome home&rsquo; to you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded. Madeline and her mother had been in Florida all winter.
      Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s health was not good. She declared that her nerves had given
      way under her frightful responsibilities during the war. There was,
      although it seems almost sacrilege to make such a statement, a certain
      similarity between Mrs. Fletcher Fosdick and Issachar Price. The telegram
      was, as his grandfather surmised, an expression of welcome and of regret
      that the senders could not be there to share in the reception. The two
      letters which accompanied it he put in his pocket to read later on, when
      alone. Somehow he felt that the first hours in the old house belonged
      exclusively to his grandparents. Everything else, even Madeline&rsquo;s letters,
      must take second place for that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was, to say the least, an ample meal. Rachel and Olive had, as
      Captain Lote said, &ldquo;laid themselves out&rdquo; on that dinner. It began well and
      continued well and ended best of all, for the dessert was one of which
      Albert was especially fond. They kept pressing him to eat until Laban, who
      was an invited guest, was moved to comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; observed Mr. Keeler. &ldquo;I knew &lsquo;twas the reg&rsquo;lar program to kill
      the fatted calf when the prodigal got home, but I see now it&rsquo;s the proper
      caper to fat up the prodigal to take the critter&rsquo;s place. No, no, Rachel,
      I&rsquo;d like fust-rate to eat another bushel or so to please you, but
      somethin&rsquo;&mdash;that still, small voice we&rsquo;re always readin&rsquo; about, or
      somethin&rsquo;&mdash;seems to tell me &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be good jedgment. . . . Um-hm.
      . . . &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be good jedgment. . . . Cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;s right, too. . . .
      Yes, yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; he added, as they rose from the table, &ldquo;you stay right
      to home here for the rest of the day. I&rsquo;ll hustle back to the office and
      see if Issy&rsquo;s importance has bust his b&rsquo;iler for him. So-long, Al. See you
      pretty soon. Got some things to talk about, you and I have. . . . Yes,
      yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Rachel was in the kitchen with the dishes, Olive left the
      sitting room and reappeared with triumph written large upon her face. In
      one hand she held a mysterious envelope and in the other a book. Albert
      recognized that book. It was his own, The Lances of Dawn. It was no
      novelty to him. When first the outside world and he had reopened
      communication, copies of that book had been sent him. His publisher had
      sent them, Madeline had sent them, his grandparents had sent them,
      comrades had sent them, nurses and doctors and newspaper men had brought
      them. No, The Lances of Dawn was not a novelty to its author. But he
      wondered what was in the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow enlightened him. &ldquo;You sit right down now, Albert,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Sit right down and listen because I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to tell you. Yes,
      and somethin&rsquo; to show you, too. Here! Stop now, Zelotes! You can&rsquo;t run
      away. You&rsquo;ve got to sit down and look on and listen, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes smiled resignedly. There was, or so it seemed to his
      grandson, an odd expression on his face. He looked pleased, but not
      altogether pleased. However, he obeyed his wife&rsquo;s orders and sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, look and listen,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Mother, you sound like a railroad
      crossin&rsquo;. All right, here I am. Al, the society of &lsquo;What did I tell you&rsquo; 
      is goin&rsquo; to have a meetin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife nodded. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, triumphantly, &ldquo;what DID I tell you?
      Wasn&rsquo;t I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain pulled his beard and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right as right could be, Mother,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Your figgers was a few
      hundred thousand out of the way, maybe, but barrin&rsquo; that you was perfectly
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so for once in your life. Albert,&rdquo; holding
      up the envelope, &ldquo;do you know what this is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, much puzzled, admitted that he did not. His grandmother put down
      the book, opened the envelope and took from it a slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you guess what THIS is?&rdquo; she asked. Albert could not guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a check, that&rsquo;s what it is. It&rsquo;s the first six months&rsquo; royalties,
      that&rsquo;s what they call &lsquo;em, on that beautiful book of yours. And how much
      do you suppose &lsquo;tis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. &ldquo;Twenty-five dollars?&rdquo; he suggested jokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-five dollars! It&rsquo;s over twenty-five HUNDRED dollars. It&rsquo;s
      twenty-eight hundred and forty-three dollars and sixty-five cents, that&rsquo;s
      what it is. Think of it! Almost three thousand dollars! And Zelotes
      prophesied that &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be more than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband held up his hand. &ldquo;Sh-sh! Sh-sh, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get
      started on what I prophesied or we won&rsquo;t be through till doomsday. I&rsquo;ll
      give in right off that I&rsquo;m the worst prophet since the feller that h&rsquo;isted
      the &lsquo;Fair and Dry&rsquo; signal the day afore Noah&rsquo;s flood begun. You see,&rdquo; he
      explained, turning to Albert, &ldquo;your grandma figgered out that you&rsquo;d
      probably clear about half a million on that book of poetry, Al. I
      cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twan&rsquo;t likely to be much more&rsquo;n a couple of hundred thousand,
      so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Zelotes Snow! You said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. So I did, Mother, so I did. You was right and I was wrong.
      Twenty-eight hundred ain&rsquo;t exactly a million, Al, but it&rsquo;s a darn sight
      more than I ever cal&rsquo;lated you&rsquo;d make from that book. Or &lsquo;most anybody
      else ever made from any book, fur&rsquo;s that goes,&rdquo; he added, with a shake of
      the head. &ldquo;I declare, I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand it yet. And a poetry
      book, too! Who in time BUYS &lsquo;em all? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was looking at the check and the royalty statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is why I couldn&rsquo;t get any satisfaction from the publisher,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;I wrote him two or three times about my royalties, and he put
      me off each time. I began to think there weren&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes smiled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your grandma&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The
      check came to us a good while ago, when we thought you was&mdash;was&mdash;well,
      when we thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Surely, I understand,&rdquo; put in Albert, to help him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s when &lsquo;twas. And Mother, she was so proud of it, because you&rsquo;d
      earned it, Al, that she kept it and kept it, showin&rsquo; it to all hands and&mdash;and
      so on. And then when we found out you wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;that you&rsquo;d be home some
      time or other&mdash;why, then she wouldn&rsquo;t let me put it in the bank for
      you because she wanted to give it to you herself. That&rsquo;s what she said was
      the reason. I presume likely the real one was that she wanted to flap it
      in my face every time she crowed over my bad prophesyin&rsquo;, which was about
      three times a day and four on Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes Snow, the idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mother, all right. Anyhow, she got me to write your publisher
      man and ask him not to give you any satisfaction about those royalties,
      so&rsquo;s she could be the fust one to paralyze you with &lsquo;em. And,&rdquo; with a
      frank outburst, &ldquo;if you ain&rsquo;t paralyzed, Al, I own up that <i>I</i> am.
      Three thousand poetry profits beats me. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife sniffed. &ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;But Albert does.
      And so do I, only I think it ought to have been ever and ever so much
      more. Don&rsquo;t you, yourself, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The author of The Lances of Dawn was still looking at the statement of its
      earnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approximately eighteen thousand sold at fifteen cents royalty,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;Humph! Well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said it would be twenty-five cents, not fifteen,&rdquo; protested
      Olive. &ldquo;In your letter when the book was first talked about you said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Well, I said a good many things in
      those days, I&rsquo;m afraid. Fifteen cents for a first book, especially a book
      of verse, is fair enough, I guess. But eighteen thousand SOLD! That is
      what gets me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you think it ought to be a lot more. So do I, Albert, and so
      does Rachel. Why, we like it a lot better than we do David Harum. That was
      a nice book, but it wasn&rsquo;t lovely poetry like yours. And David Harum sold
      a million. Why shouldn&rsquo;t yours sell as many? Only eighteen thousand&mdash;why
      are you lookin&rsquo; at me so funny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandson rose to his feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s let well enough alone, Grandmother,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Eighteen thousand will do, thank you. I&rsquo;m like Grandfather, I&rsquo;m
      wondering who on earth bought them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow was surprised and a little troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Albert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you act kind of&mdash;kind of queer, seems to
      me. You talk as if your poetry wasn&rsquo;t beautiful. You know it is. You used
      to say it was, yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her. &ldquo;Did I, Grandmother?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All right, then,
      probably I did. Let&rsquo;s walk about the old place a little. I want to see it
      all. By George, I&rsquo;ve been dreaming about it long enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were callers that afternoon, friends among the townsfolk, and more
      still after supper. It was late&mdash;late for South Harniss, that is&mdash;when
      Albert, standing in the doorway of the bedroom he nor they had ever
      expected he would occupy again, bade his grandparents good night. Olive
      kissed him again and again and, speech failing her, hastened away down the
      hall. Captain Zelotes shook his hand, opened his mouth to speak, shut it
      again, repeated both operations, and at last with a brief, &ldquo;Well, good
      night, Al,&rdquo; hurried after his wife. Albert closed the door, put his lamp
      upon the bureau, and sat down in the big rocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way the night was similar to that upon which he had first entered
      that room. It had ceased raining, but the wind, as on that first night,
      was howling and whining about the eaves, the shutters rattled and the old
      house creaked and groaned rheumatically. It was not as cold as on that
      occasion, though by no means warm. He remembered how bare and comfortless
      he had thought the room. Now it looked almost luxurious. And he had been
      homesick, or fancied himself in that condition. Compared to the
      homesickness he had known during the past eighteen months that youthful
      seizure seemed contemptible and quite without excuse. He looked about the
      room again, looked long and lovingly. Then, with a sigh of content, drew
      from his pocket the two letters which had lain upon the sitting-room table
      when he arrived, opened them and began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline wrote, as always, vivaciously and at length. The maternal
      censorship having been removed, she wrote exactly as she felt. She could
      scarcely believe he was really going to be at home when he received this,
      at home in dear, quaint, queer old South Harniss. Just think, she had not
      seen the place for ever and ever so long, not for over two years. How were
      all the funny, odd people who lived there all the time? Did he remember
      how he and she used to go to church every Sunday and sit through those
      dreadful, DREADFUL sermons by that prosy old minister just as an excuse
      for meeting each other afterward? She was SO sorry she could not have been
      there to welcome her hero when he stepped from the train. If it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for Mother&rsquo;s poor nerves she surely would have been. He knew it,
      didn&rsquo;t he? Of course he did. But she should see him soon &ldquo;because Mother
      is planning already to come back to New York in a few weeks and then you
      are to run over immediately and make us a LONG visit. And I shall be so
      PROUD of you. There are lots of Army fellows down here now, officers for
      the most part. So we dance and are very gay&mdash;that is, the other girls
      are; I, being an engaged young lady, am very circumspect and demure, of
      course. Mother carries The Lances about with her wherever she goes, to
      teas and such things, and reads aloud from it often. Captain Blanchard, he
      is one of the family&rsquo;s officer friends, is crazy about your poetry, dear.
      He thinks it WONDERFUL. You know what <i>I</i> think of it, don&rsquo;t you, and
      when I think that <i>I</i> actually helped you, or played at helping you
      write some of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am WILD to see your war cross. Some of the officers here have them&mdash;the
      crosses, I mean&mdash;but not many. Captain Blanchard has the military
      medal, and he is almost as modest about it as you are about your
      decoration. I don&rsquo;t see how you CAN be so modest. If <i>I</i> had a Croix
      de Guerre I should want EVERY ONE to know about it. At the tea dance the
      other afternoon there was a British major who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on. The second letter was really a continuation of the first.
      Albert read them both and, after the reading was finished, sat for some
      time in the rocking chair, quite regardless of the time and the cold,
      thinking. He took from his pocketbook a photograph, one which Madeline had
      sent him months before, which had reached him while he lay in the French
      hospital after his removal from the German camp. He looked at the pretty
      face in the photograph. She looked just as he remembered her, almost
      exactly as she had looked more than two years before, smiling, charming,
      carefree. She had not, apparently, grown older, those age-long months had
      not changed her. He rose and regarded his own reflection in the mirror of
      the bureau. He was surprised, as he was constantly being surprised, to see
      that he, too, had not changed greatly in personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked about the room. His grandmother had told him that his room was
      just as he had left it. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t change it, Albert,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;even
      when we thought you&mdash;you wasn&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; back. I couldn&rsquo;t touch it,
      somehow. I kept thinkin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Some day I will. Pretty soon I MUST.&rsquo; But I
      never did, and now I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wandered back to the bureau and pulled open the upper drawers. In those
      drawers were so many things, things which he had kept there, either
      deliberately or because he was too indolent to destroy them. Old dance
      cards, invitations, and a bundle of photographs, snapshots. He removed the
      rubber band from the bundle and stood looking them over. Photographs of
      school fellows, of picnic groups, of girls. Sam Thatcher, Gertie Kendrick&mdash;and
      Helen Kendall. There were at least a dozen of Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One in particular was very good. From that photograph the face of Helen as
      he had known it four years before looked straight up into his&mdash;clear-eyed,
      honest, a hint of humor and understanding and common-sense in the gaze and
      at the corners of the lips. He looked at the photograph, and the
      photograph looked up at him. He had not seen her for so long a time. He
      wondered if the war had changed her as it had changed him. Somehow he
      hoped it had not. Change did not seem necessary in her case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no correspondence between them since her letter written
      when she heard of his enlistment. He had not replied to that because he
      knew Madeline would not wish him to do so. He wondered if she ever thought
      of him now, if she remembered their adventure at High Point light. He had
      thought of her often enough. In those days and nights of horror in the
      prison camp and hospital he had found a little relief, a little solace in
      lying with closed eyes and summoning back from memory the things of home
      and the faces of home. And her face had been one of these. Her face and
      those of his grandparents and Rachel and Laban, and visions of the old
      house and the rooms&mdash;they were the substantial things to cling to and
      he had clung to them. They WERE home. Madeline&mdash;ah! yes, he had
      longed for her and dreamed of her, God knew, but Madeline, of course, was
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snapped the rubber band once more about the bundle of photographs,
      closed the drawer and prepared for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the two weeks following his return home he had a thoroughly good time.
      It was a tremendous comfort to get up when he pleased, to eat the things
      he liked, to do much or little or nothing at his own sweet will. He walked
      a good deal, tramping along the beach in the blustering wind and chilly
      sunshine and enjoying every breath of the clean salt air. He thought much
      during those solitary walks, and at times, at home in the evenings, he
      would fall to musing and sit silent for long periods. His grandmother was
      troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it seem to you, Zelotes,&rdquo; she asked her husband, &ldquo;as if Albert was
      kind of discontented or unsatisfied these days? He&rsquo;s so&mdash;so sort of
      fidgety. Talks like the very mischief for ten minutes and then don&rsquo;t speak
      for half an hour. Sits still for a long stretch and then jumps up and
      starts off walkin&rsquo; as if he was crazy. What makes him act so? He&rsquo;s kind of
      changed from what he used to be. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain patted her shoulder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Al&rsquo;s
      older than he was and what he&rsquo;s been through has made him older still. As
      for the fidgety part of it, the settin&rsquo; down and jumpin&rsquo; up and all that,
      that&rsquo;s the way they all act, so far as I can learn. Elisha Warren, over to
      South Denboro, tells me his nephew has been that way ever since he got
      back. Don&rsquo;t fret, Mother, Al will come round all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know but he might be anxious to see&mdash;to see her, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her? Oh, you mean the Fosdick girl. Well, he&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; to see her
      pretty soon, I presume likely. They&rsquo;re due back in New York &lsquo;most any time
      now, I believe. . . . Oh, hum! Why in time couldn&rsquo;t he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he what, Zelotes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The summons came only a day after this conversation. It came in the form
      of another letter from Madeline and one from Mrs. Fosdick. They were, so
      the latter wrote, back once more in their city home, her nerves, thank
      Heaven, were quite strong again, and they were expecting him, Albert, to
      come on at once. &ldquo;We are all dying to see you,&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Fosdick. &ldquo;And
      poor, dear Madeline, of course, is counting the moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay as long as you feel like, Al,&rdquo; said the captain, when told of the
      proposed visit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dull season at the office, anyhow, and Labe and
      I can get along first-rate, with Issy to superintend. Stay as long as you
      want to, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what, Grandfather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t want to stay too long. That is, don&rsquo;t fall in love with New
      York so hard that you forget there is such a place as South Harniss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in places farther away than New York,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and I never forgot South Harniss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. . . . Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if that was so. But you&rsquo;ll
      have better company in New York than you did in some of those places. Give
      my regards to Fosdick. So-long, Al.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Fosdick car was at the Grand Central Station when the Knickerbocker
      Limited pulled in. And Madeline, a wonderfully furred and veiled and
      hatted Madeline, was waiting there behind the rail as he came up the
      runway from the train. It was amazing the fact that it was really she. It
      was more amazing still to kiss her there in public, to hold her hand
      without fear that some one might see. To&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I take your bags, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Fosdick footman who asked it. Albert started guiltily. Then he
      laughed, realizing that the hand-holding and the rest were no longer
      criminal offenses. He surrendered his luggage to the man. A few minutes
      later he and Madeline were in the limousine, which was moving rapidly up
      the Avenue. And Madeline was asking questions and he was answering and&mdash;and
      still it was all a dream. It COULDN&rsquo;T be real.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even more like a dream when the limousine drew up before the door
      of the Fosdick home and they entered that home together. For there was
      Mrs. Fosdick, as ever majestic, commanding, awe-inspiring, the same Mrs.
      Fosdick who had, in her letter to his grandfather, written him down a
      despicable, underhanded sneak, here was that same Mrs. Fosdick&mdash;but
      not at all the same. For this lady was smiling and gracious, welcoming him
      to her home, addressing him by his Christian name, treating him kindly,
      with almost motherly tenderness. Madeline&rsquo;s letters and Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s own
      letters received during his convalescence abroad had prepared him, or so
      he had thought, for some such change. Now he realized that he had not been
      prepared at all. The reality was so much more revolutionary than the
      anticipation that he simply could not believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not so very wonderful if he had known all the facts and had
      been in a frame of mind to calmly analyze them. Mrs. Fletcher Fosdick was
      a seasoned veteran, a general who had planned and fought many hard
      campaigns upon the political battlegrounds of women&rsquo;s clubs and societies
      of various sorts. From the majority of those campaigns she had emerged
      victorious, but her experiences in defeat had taught her that the next
      best thing to winning is to lose gracefully, because by so doing much
      which appears to be lost may be regained. For Albert Speranza, bookkeeper
      and would-be poet of South Harniss, Cape Cod, she had had no use whatever
      as a prospective son-in-law. Even toward a living Albert Speranza, hero
      and newspaper-made genius, she might have been cold. But when that hero
      and genius was, as she and every one else supposed, safely and
      satisfactorily dead and out of the way, she had seized the opportunity to
      bask in the radiance of his memory. She had talked Albert Speranza and
      read Albert Speranza and boasted of Albert Speranza&rsquo;s engagement to her
      daughter before the world. Now that the said Albert Speranza had been
      inconsiderate enough to &ldquo;come alive again,&rdquo; there was but one thing for
      her to do&mdash;that is, to make the best of it. And when Mrs. Fletcher
      Fosdick made the best of anything she made the very best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; she told her husband, &ldquo;whether he really
      is a genius or whether he isn&rsquo;t. We have said he is and now we must keep
      on saying it. And if he can&rsquo;t earn his salt by his writings&mdash;which he
      probably can&rsquo;t&mdash;then you must fix it in some way so that he can
      make-believe earn it by something else. He is engaged to Madeline, and we
      have told every one that he is, so he will have to marry her; at least, I
      see no way to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Fosdick. &ldquo;And after that I&rsquo;ll have to support them, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably&mdash;unless you want your only child to starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say, Henrietta&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t, for there is nothing more TO say. We&rsquo;re in it and, whether
      we like it or not, we must make the best of it. To do anything now except
      appear joyful about it would be to make ourselves perfectly ridiculous. We
      can&rsquo;t do that, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband still looked everything but contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as the young fellow himself goes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I like him, rather.
      I&rsquo;ve talked with him only once, of course, and then he and I weren&rsquo;t
      agreeing exactly. But I liked him, nevertheless. If he were anything but a
      fool poet I should be more reconciled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was snubbed immediately. &ldquo;THAT,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Fosdick, with decision,
      &ldquo;is the only thing that makes him possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s welcome was whole-handed if not whole-hearted. And her
      husband&rsquo;s also was cordial and intimate. The only member of the Fosdick
      household who did not regard the guest with favor was Googoo. That
      aristocratic bull-pup was still irreconcilably hostile. When Albert
      attempted to pet him he appeared to be planning to devour the caressing
      hand, and when rebuked by his mistress retired beneath a davenport,
      growling ominously. Even when ignominiously expelled from the room he
      growled and cast longing backward glances at the Speranza ankles. No,
      Googoo did not dissemble; Albert was perfectly sure of his standing in
      Googoo&rsquo;s estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner that evening was a trifle more formal than he had expected, and he
      was obliged to apologize for the limitations of his wardrobe. His dress
      suit of former days he had found much too dilapidated for use. Besides, he
      had outgrown it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was thinner,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I think I am. But I must have
      broadened a bit. At any rate, all the coats I left behind won&rsquo;t do at all.
      I shall have to do what Captain Snow, my grandfather, calls &lsquo;refit&rsquo; here
      in New York. In a day or two I hope to be more presentable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fosdick assured him that it was quite all right, really. Madeline
      asked why he didn&rsquo;t wear his uniform. &ldquo;I was dying to see you in it,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Just think, I never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. &ldquo;You have been spared,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Mine was not a
      triumph, so far as fit was concerned. Of course, I had a complete new rig
      when I came out of the hospital, but even that was not beautiful. It
      puckered where it should have bulged and bulged where it should have been
      smooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madeline professed not to believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. Why, almost all the fellows
      I know have been in uniform for the past two years and theirs fitted
      beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they were officers, weren&rsquo;t they, and their uniforms were custom
      made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose so. Aren&rsquo;t all uniforms custom made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father laughed. &ldquo;Scarcely, Maddie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The privates have their
      custom-made by the mile and cut off in chunks for the individual. That was
      about it, wasn&rsquo;t it, Speranza?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fosdick evidently thought that the conversation was taking a rather
      low tone. She elevated it by asking what his thoughts were when taken
      prisoner by the Germans. He looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoughts, Mrs. Fosdick?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I understand,
      exactly. I was only partly conscious and in a good deal of pain and my
      thoughts were rather incoherent, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you regained consciousness, you know. What were your thoughts
      then? Did you realize that you had made the great sacrifice for your
      country? Risked your life and forfeited your liberty and all that for the
      cause? Wasn&rsquo;t it a great satisfaction to feel that you had done that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert&rsquo;s laugh was hearty and unaffected. &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think
      what I was realizing most just then was that I had made a miserable mess
      of the whole business. Failed in doing what I set out to do and been taken
      prisoner besides. I remember thinking, when I was clear-headed enough to
      think anything, &lsquo;You fool, you spent months getting into this war, and
      then got yourself out of it in fifteen minutes.&rsquo; And it WAS a silly trick,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madeline was horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What DO you mean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Your going back there to rescue your
      comrade a silly trick! The very thing that won you your Croix de Guerre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, in a way. I didn&rsquo;t save Mike, poor fellow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mike! Was his name Mike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Michael Francis Xavier Kelly. A South Boston Mick he was, and one of
      the finest, squarest boys that ever drew breath. Well, poor Mike was dead
      when I got to him, so my trip had been for nothing, and if he had been
      alive I could not have prevented his being taken. As it was, he was dead
      and I was a prisoner. So nothing was gained and, for me, personally, a
      good deal was lost. It wasn&rsquo;t a brilliant thing to do. But,&rdquo; he added
      apologetically, &ldquo;a chap doesn&rsquo;t have time to think collectively in such a
      scrape. And it was my first real scrap and I was frightened half to death,
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened! Why, I never heard anything so ridiculous! What&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Madeline.&rdquo; It was Mrs. Fosdick who interrupted. &ldquo;I want to
      ask&mdash;er&mdash;Albert a question. I want to ask him if during his long
      imprisonment he composed&mdash;wrote, you know. I should have thought the
      sights and experiences would have forced one to express one&rsquo;s self&mdash;that
      is, one to whom the gift of expression was so generously granted,&rdquo; she
      added, with a gracious nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, at first I did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I first was well enough to think, I
      used to try to write&mdash;verses. I wrote a good many. Afterwards I tore
      them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tore them up!&rdquo; Both Mrs. and Miss Fosdick uttered this exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes. You see, they were such rot. The things I wanted to write
      about, the things <i>I</i> had seen and was seeing, the&mdash;the fellows
      like Mike and their pluck and all that&mdash;well, it was all too big for
      me to tackle. My jingles sounded, when I read them over, like tunes on a
      street piano. <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t do it. A genius might have been equal to
      the job, but I wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fosdick glanced at her husband. There was something of alarmed
      apprehension in the glance. Madeline&rsquo;s next remark covered the situation.
      It expressed the absolute truth, so much more of the truth than even the
      young lady herself realized at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Albert Speranza,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I never heard you speak of
      yourself and your work in that way before. Always&mdash;ALWAYS you have
      had such complete, such splendid confidence in yourself. You were never
      afraid to attempt ANYTHING. You MUST not talk so. Don&rsquo;t you intend to
      write any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked at her. &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;That is just
      what I do intend to do&mdash;or try to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, alone in the library, he and Madeline had their first long,
      intimate talk, the first since those days&mdash;to him they seemed as far
      away as the last century&mdash;when they walked the South Harniss beach
      together, walked beneath the rainbows and dreamed. And now here was their
      dream coming true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madeline, he was realizing it as he looked at her, was prettier than ever.
      She had grown a little older, of course, a little more mature, but
      surprisingly little. She was still a girl, a very, very pretty girl and a
      charming girl. And he&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; she demanded suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to himself. &ldquo;I was thinking about you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are just as
      you used to be, just as charming and just as sweet. You haven&rsquo;t changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and then pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to like that or not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you expect to
      find me less&mdash;charming and the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, of course not. That was clumsy on my part. What I meant was that&mdash;well,
      it seems ages, centuries, since we were together there on the Cape&mdash;and
      yet you have not changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed. You have changed a good deal. I don&rsquo;t know whether I like it or
      not. Perhaps I shall be more certain by and by. Now show me your war
      cross. At least you have brought that, even if you haven&rsquo;t brought your
      uniform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had the cross in his pocket-book and he showed it to her. She enthused
      over it, of course, and wished he might wear it even when in citizen&rsquo;s
      clothes. She didn&rsquo;t see why he couldn&rsquo;t. And it was SUCH a pity he could
      not be in uniform. Captain Blanchard had called the evening before, to see
      Mother about some war charities she was interested in, and he was still in
      uniform and wearing his decorations, too. Albert suggested that probably
      Blanchard was still in service. Yes, she believed he was, but she could
      not see why that should make the difference. Albert had BEEN in service.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at this and attempted to explain. She seemed to resent the
      attempt or the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish,&rdquo; she said almost pettishly, &ldquo;that you wouldn&rsquo;t be so
      superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised. &ldquo;Superior!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Superior! I? Superiority is
      the very least of my feelings. I&mdash;superior! That&rsquo;s a joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, oddly enough, she resented that even more. &ldquo;Why is it a joke?&rdquo; she
      demanded. &ldquo;I should think you had the right to feel superior to almost any
      one. A hero&mdash;and a genius! You ARE superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, the little flurry was but momentary, and she was all sweetness
      and smiles when she kissed him good night. He was shown to his room by a
      servant and amid its array of comforts&mdash;to him, fresh from France and
      the camp and his old room at South Harniss, it was luxuriously magnificent&mdash;he
      sat for some time thinking. His thoughts should have been happy ones, yet
      they were not entirely so. This is a curiously unsatisfactory world,
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he went shopping. Fosdick had given him a card to his own
      tailor and Madeline had given him the names of several shops where, so she
      declared, he could buy the right sort of ties and things. From the
      tailor&rsquo;s Albert emerged looking a trifle dazed; after a visit to two of
      the shops the dazed expression was even more pronounced. His next visits
      were at establishments farther downtown and not as exclusive. He returned
      to the Fosdick home feeling fairly well satisfied with the results
      achieved. Madeline, however, did not share his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dad sent you to his tailor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why in the world didn&rsquo;t you
      order your evening clothes there? And Brett has the most stunning ties.
      Every one says so. Instead you buy yours at a department store. Now why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your father&rsquo;s tailor estimated that
      he might make me a very passable dress suit for one hundred and
      seventy-five dollars. Brett&rsquo;s ties were stunning, just as you say, but the
      prices ranged from five to eight dollars, which was more stunning still.
      For a young person from the country out of a job, which is my condition at
      present, such things may be looked at but not handled. I can&rsquo;t afford
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head. &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not out of a
      job, as you call it. You are a writer and a famous writer. You have
      written one book and you are going to write more. Besides, you must have
      made heaps of money from The Lances. Every one has been reading it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he told her the amount of his royalty check she expressed the opinion
      that the publisher must have cheated. It ought to have been ever and ever
      so much more than that. Such wonderful poems!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she went to Brett&rsquo;s and purchased a half dozen of the most
      expensive ties, which she presented to him forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those nicer than the ones you bought at
      that old department store? Well, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Madeline, I must not let you buy my ties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It isn&rsquo;t such an unheard-of thing for an engaged girl to give
      her fiance a necktie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the idea. I should have bought ties like those myself, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t afford them. Now for you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You talk as if you were a beggar. Don&rsquo;t be so silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Madeline&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! I don&rsquo;t want to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and went out of the room. She looked as if she were on the verge
      of tears. He felt obliged to accept the gift, but he disliked the
      principle of the things as much as ever. When she returned she was very
      talkative and gay and chatted all through luncheon. The subject of the
      ties was not mentioned again by either of them. He was glad he had not
      told her that his new dress suit was ready-made.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in France, awaiting his return home, he had purchased a ring and
      sent it to her. She was wearing it, of course. Compared with other
      articles of jewelry which she wore from time to time, his ring made an
      extremely modest showing. She seemed quite unaware of the discrepancy, but
      he was aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an evening later in the week Mrs. Fosdick gave a reception. &ldquo;Quite an
      informal affair,&rdquo; she said, in announcing her intention. &ldquo;Just a few
      intimate friends to meet Mr. Speranza, that is all. Mostly lovers of
      literature&mdash;discerning people, if I may say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The quite informal affair looked quite formidably formal to Albert. The
      few intimate friends were many, so it seemed to him. There was still
      enough of the former Albert Speranza left in his make-up to prevent his
      appearing in the least distressed or ill at ease. He was, as he had always
      been when in the public eye, even as far back as the school
      dancing-classes with the Misses Bradshaw&rsquo;s young ladies, perfectly
      self-possessed, charmingly polite, absolutely self-assured. And his good
      looks had not suffered during his years of imprisonment and suffering. He
      was no longer a handsome boy, but he was an extraordinarily attractive and
      distinguished man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fosdick marked his manner and appearance and breathed a sigh of
      satisfaction. Madeline noted them. Her young friends of the sex noted them
      and whispered and looked approval. What the young men thought does not
      matter so much, perhaps. One of these was the Captain Blanchard, of whom
      Madeline had written and spoken. He was a tall, athletic chap, who looked
      well in his uniform, and whose face was that of a healthy, clean-living
      and clean-thinking young American. He and Albert shook hands and looked
      each other over. Albert decided he should like Blanchard if he knew him
      better. The captain was not talkative; in fact, he seemed rather taciturn.
      Maids and matrons gushed when presented to the lion of the evening. It
      scarcely seemed possible that they were actually meeting the author of The
      Lances of Dawn. That wonderful book! Those wonderful poems! &ldquo;How CAN you
      write them, Mr. Speranza?&rdquo; &ldquo;When do your best inspirations come, Mr.
      Speranza?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, if I could write as you do I should walk on air.&rdquo; The
      matron who breathed the last-quoted ecstasy was distinctly weighty; the
      mental picture of her pedestrian trip through the atmosphere was
      interesting. Albert&rsquo;s hand was patted by the elderly spinsters, young
      women&rsquo;s eyes lifted soulful glances to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sort of thing he would have revelled in three or four years
      earlier. Exactly the sort of thing he had dreamed of when the majority of
      the poems they gushed over were written. It was much the same thing he
      remembered having seen his father undergo in the days when he and the
      opera singer were together. And his father had, apparently, rather enjoyed
      it. He realized all this&mdash;and he realized, too, with a queer feeling
      that it should be so, that he did not like it at all. It was silly.
      Nothing he had written warranted such extravagances. Hadn&rsquo;t these people
      any sense of proportion? They bored him to desperation. The sole relief
      was the behavior of the men, particularly the middle-aged or elderly men,
      obviously present through feminine compulsion. They seized his hand, moved
      it up and down with a pumping motion, uttered some stereotyped
      prevarications about their pleasure at meeting him and their having
      enjoyed his poems very much, and then slid on in the direction of the
      refreshment room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Albert, as he shook hands, bowed and smiled and was charmingly
      affable, found his thoughts wandering until they settled upon Private Mike
      Kelly and the picturesque language of the latter when he, as sergeant,
      routed him out for guard duty. Mike had not gushed over him nor called him
      a genius. He had called him many things, but not that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad indeed when he could slip away for a dance with Madeline. He
      found her chatting gaily with Captain Blanchard, who had been her most
      recent partner. He claimed her from the captain and as he led her out to
      the dance floor she whispered that she was very proud of him. &ldquo;But I DO
      wish YOU could wear your war cross,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quite informal affair was the first of many quite as informally
      formal. Also Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s satellites and friends of the literary clubs
      and the war work societies seized the opportunity to make much of the
      heroic author of The Lances of Dawn. His society was requested at teas, at
      afternoon as well as evening gatherings. He would have refused most of
      these invitations, but Madeline and her mother seemed to take his
      acceptance for granted; in fact, they accepted for him. A ghastly habit
      developed of asking him to read a few of his own poems on these occasions.
      &ldquo;PLEASE, Mr. Speranza. It will be such a treat, and such an HONOR.&rdquo;
       Usually a particular request was made that he read &ldquo;The Greater Love.&rdquo; Now
      &ldquo;The Greater Love&rdquo; was the poem which, written in those rapturous days
      when he and Madeline first became aware of their mutual adoration, was
      refused by one editor as a &ldquo;trifle too syrupy.&rdquo; To read that sticky
      effusion over and over again became a torment. There were occasions when
      if a man had referred to &ldquo;The Greater Love,&rdquo; its author might have howled
      profanely and offered bodily violence. But no men ever did refer to &ldquo;The
      Greater Love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion when a sentimental matron and her gushing daughter had
      begged to know if he did not himself adore that poem, if he did not
      consider it the best he had ever written, he had answered frankly. He was
      satiated with cake and tea and compliments that evening and recklessly
      truthful. &ldquo;You really wish to know my opinion of that poem?&rdquo; he asked.
      Indeed and indeed they really wished to knew just that thing. &ldquo;Well, then,
      I think it&rsquo;s rot,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I loathe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course mother and daughter were indignant. Their comments reached
      Madeline&rsquo;s ear. She took him to task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you say it?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do mean it. It IS rot. Lots of the stuff in that book of mine is
      rot. I did not think so once, but I do now. If I had the book to make over
      again, that sort wouldn&rsquo;t be included.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for a moment as if studying a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you sometimes,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;You are different.
      And I think what you said to Mrs. Bacon and Marian was very rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later when he went to look for her he found her seated with Captain
      Blanchard in a corner. They were eating ices and, apparently, enjoying
      themselves. He did not disturb them. Instead he hunted up the offended
      Bacons and apologized for his outbreak. The apology, although graciously
      accepted, had rather wearisome consequences. Mrs. Bacon declared she knew
      that he had not really meant what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I realize how it must be,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You people of temperament, of
      genius, of aspirations, are never quite satisfied, you cannot be. You are
      always trying, always seeking the higher attainment. Achievements of the
      past, though to the rest of us wonderful and sublime, are to you&mdash;as
      you say, &lsquo;rot.&rsquo; That is it, is it not?&rdquo; Albert said he guessed it was, and
      wandered away, seeking seclusion and solitude. When the affair broke up he
      found Madeline and Blanchard still enjoying each other&rsquo;s society. Both
      were surprised when told the hour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the first three weeks of his proposed month&rsquo;s visit passed and the
      fourth began. And more and more his feelings of dissatisfaction and
      uneasiness increased. The reasons for those feelings he found hard to
      define. The Fosdicks were most certainly doing their best to make him
      comfortable and happy. They were kind&mdash;yes, more than kind. Mr.
      Fosdick he really began to like. Mrs. Fosdick&rsquo;s manner had a trace of
      condescension in it, but as the lady treated all creation with much the
      same measure of condescension, he was more amused than resentful. And
      Madeline&mdash;Madeline was sweet and charming and beautiful. There was in
      her manner toward him, or so he fancied, a slight change, perhaps a change
      a trifle more marked since the evening when his expressed opinion of &ldquo;The
      Greater Love&rdquo; had offended her and the Bacons. It seemed to him that she
      was more impatient, more capricious, sometimes almost overwhelming him
      with attention and tenderness and then appearing to forget him entirely
      and to be quite indifferent to his thoughts and opinions. Her moods varied
      greatly and there were occasions when he found it almost impossible to
      please her. At these times she took offense when no offense was intended
      and he found himself apologizing when, to say the least, the fault, if
      there was any, was not more than half his. But she always followed those
      moods with others of contrition and penitence and then he was petted and
      fondled and his forgiveness implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      These slight changes in her he noticed, but they troubled him little,
      principally because he was coming to realize the great change in himself.
      More and more that change was forcing itself upon him. The stories and
      novels he had read during the first years of the war, the stories by
      English writers in which young men, frivolous and inconsequential, had
      enlisted and fought and emerged from the ordeal strong, purposeful and
      &ldquo;made-over&rdquo;&mdash;those stories recurred to him now. He had paid little
      attention to the &ldquo;making-over" idea when he read those tales, but now he
      was forced to believe there might be something in it. Certainly something,
      the three years or the discipline and training and suffering, or all
      combined, had changed him. He was not as he used to be. Things he liked
      very much he no longer liked at all. And where, oh where, was the serene
      self-satisfaction which once was his?
    </p>
    <p>
      The change must be quite individual, he decided. All soldiers were not so
      affected. Take Blanchard, for instance. Blanchard had seen service, more
      and quite as hard fighting as he had seen, but Blanchard was, to all
      appearances, as light-hearted and serene and confident as ever. Blanchard
      was like Madeline; he was much the same now as he had been before the war.
      Blanchard could dance and talk small talk and laugh and enjoy himself.
      Well, so could he, on occasions, for that matter, if that had been all.
      But it was not all, or if it was why was he at other times so discontented
      and uncomfortable? What was the matter with him, anyway?
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew more and more into his shell and became more quiet and less
      talkative. Madeline, in one of her moods, reproached him for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t be grumpy,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been sitting in the library and he had lapsed into a fit of
      musing, answering her questions with absentminded monosyllables. Now he
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grumpy?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Was I grumpy? I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should. You answered every word I spoke to you with a grunt or a
      growl. I might as well have been talking to a bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, dear. I didn&rsquo;t feel grumpy. I was thinking, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking! You are always thinking. Why think, pray? . . . If I permitted
      myself to think, I should go insane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madeline, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. I&rsquo;m partially insane now, perhaps. Come, let&rsquo;s go to the
      piano. I feel like playing. You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Mrs. Fosdick made a suggestion to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fletcher,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am inclined to think it is time you and Albert
      had a talk concerning the future. A business talk, I mean. I am a little
      uneasy about him. From some things he has said to me recently I gather
      that he is planning to earn his living with his pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how else did you expect him to earn it; as bookkeeper for the South
      Harniss lumber concern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd. What I mean is that he is thinking of devoting himself
      to literature exclusively. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me, please. That is very
      beautiful and very idealistic, and I honor him for it, but I cannot see
      Madeline as an attic poet&rsquo;s wife, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, and I told you so in the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Therefore I should take him to one side and tell him of the opening
      in your firm. With that as a means of keeping his feet on the ground his
      brain may soar as it likes, the higher the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fosdick, as usual, obeyed orders and that afternoon Albert and he had
      the &ldquo;business talk.&rdquo; Conversation at dinner was somewhat strained. Mr.
      Fosdick was quietly observant and seemed rather amused about something.
      His wife was dignified and her manner toward her guest was inclined to be
      abrupt. Albert&rsquo;s appetite was poor. As for Madeline, she did not come down
      to dinner, having a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down later, however. Albert, alone in the library, was sitting, a
      book upon his knees and his eyes fixed upon nothing in particular, when
      she came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thinking again, I see,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not heard her enter. Now he rose, the book falling to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;How are you feeling? How is your
      head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no worse. And no better. I have been thinking, too, which perhaps
      explains it. Sit down, Albert, please. I want to talk with you. That is
      what I have been thinking about, that you and I must talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself upon the davenport and he pulled forward a chair and
      sat facing her. For a moment she was silent. When she did speak, however,
      her question was very much to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to Father&rsquo;s offer?&rdquo; she asked. He had been expecting
      this very question, or one leading up to it. Nevertheless, he found
      answering difficult. He hesitated, and she watched him, her impatience
      growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;Madeline,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am afraid you think me very
      unreasonable, certainly very ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think about you. That is why I feel we must have
      this talk. Tell me, please, just what Father said to you this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said&mdash;well, the substance of what he said was to offer me a
      position in his office, in his firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I scarcely know. I was to have a desk there and&mdash;and
      be generally&mdash;ornamental, I suppose. It was not very definite, the
      details of the position, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The salary was good, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; more than good. Much too good for the return I could make for it, so
      it seemed to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your prospects for the future? Wasn&rsquo;t the offer what people call a
      good opportunity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I suppose it was. For the right sort of man it would have been
      a wonderful opportunity. Your father was most kind, most generous,
      Madeline. Please don&rsquo;t think I am not appreciative. I am, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. I want to understand it all. He offered you this opportunity, this
      partnership in his firm, and you would not accept it? Why? Don&rsquo;t you like
      my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I like him very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; with the slightest possible curl of the lip, &ldquo;think the
      offer worthy of you? . . . Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that! Please forgive me. I am
      trying not to be disagreeable. I&mdash;I just want to understand, Albert,
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;I know, Madeline,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have the right to ask. It
      wasn&rsquo;t so much a question of the offer being worthy of me as of my being
      worthy the offer. Oh, Madeline, why should you and I pretend? You know why
      Mr. Fosdick made me that offer. It wasn&rsquo;t because I was likely to be worth
      ten dollars a year to his firm. In Heaven&rsquo;s name, what use would I be in a
      stockbroker&rsquo;s office, with my make-up, with my lack of business ability?
      He would be making a place for me there and paying me a high salary for
      one reason only, and you know what that is. Now don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated now, but only for an instant. She colored a little, but she
      answered bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but what of it? It is not unheard of, is it,
      the taking one&rsquo;s prospective son-in-law into partnership?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but&mdash;We&rsquo;re dodging the issue again, Madeline. If I were likely
      to be of any help to your father&rsquo;s business, instead of a hindrance, I
      might perhaps see it differently. As it is, I couldn&rsquo;t accept unless I
      were willing to be an object of charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell Father that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said a good deal. He was frank enough to say that he did not expect me
      to be of great assistance to the firm. But I might be of SOME use&mdash;he
      didn&rsquo;t put it as baldly as that, of course&mdash;and at all times I could
      keep on with my writing, with my poetry, you know. The brokerage business
      should not interfere with my poetry, he said; your mother would scalp him
      if it did that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled faintly. &ldquo;That sounds like dad,&rdquo; she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, we talked and argued for some time on the subject. He asked me
      what, supposing I did not accept this offer of his, my plans for the
      future might be. I told him they were pretty unsettled as yet. I meant to
      write, of course. Not poetry altogether. I realized, I told him, that I
      was not a great poet, a poet of genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madeline interrupted. Her eyes flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I have heard you say it before. That
      is, recently. In the old days you were as sure as I that you were a real
      poet, or should be some day. You never doubted it. You used to tell me so
      and I loved to hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. &ldquo;I was sure of so many things then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      must have been an insufferable kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stamped her foot. &ldquo;It was less than three years ago that you said it,&rdquo;
       she declared. &ldquo;You are not so frightfully ancient now. . . . Well, go on,
      go on. How did it end, the talk with Father, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I meant to write and to earn my living
      by writing. I meant to try magazine work&mdash;stories, you know&mdash;and,
      soon, a novel. He asked if earning enough to support a wife on would not
      be a long job at that time. I said I was afraid it might, but that that
      seemed to me my particular game, nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted again. &ldquo;Did it occur to you to question whether or not
      that determination of yours was quite fair to me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes, it did. And I don&rsquo;t know that it IS exactly fair to
      you. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Go on. Tell me the rest. How did it end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it ended in a sort of flare-up. Mr. Fosdick was just a little bit
      sarcastic, and I expressed my feelings rather freely&mdash;too freely, I&rsquo;m
      afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. I want to know what you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be absolutely truthful, then, this is what I said: I said that I
      appreciated his kindness and was grateful for the offer. But my mind was
      made up. I would not live upon his charity and draw a large salary for
      doing nothing except be a little, damned tame house-poet led around in
      leash and exhibited at his wife&rsquo;s club meetings. . . . That was about all,
      I think. We shook hands at the end. He didn&rsquo;t seem to like me any the less
      for . . . Why, Madeline, have I offended you? My language was pretty
      strong, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had bowed her head upon her arms amid the sofa cushions and was
      crying. He sprang to his feet and bent over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Madeline,&rdquo; he said again, &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. I don&rsquo;t care what you
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is myself. It is everything. It is all wrong.
      I&mdash;I was so happy and&mdash;and now I am miserable. Oh&mdash;oh, I
      wish I were dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself upon the cushions again and wept hysterically. He stood
      above her, stroking her hair, trying to soothe her, to comfort her, and
      all the time he felt like a brute, a heartless beast. At last she ceased
      crying, sat up and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I will not be silly any longer. I won&rsquo;t be! I
      WON&rsquo;T! . . . Now tell me: Why have you changed so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her and shook his head. He was conscience-stricken and
      fully as miserable as she professed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am older and&mdash;and&mdash;and I DON&rsquo;T see
      things as I used to. If that book of mine had appeared three years ago I
      have no doubt I should have believed it to be the greatest thing ever
      printed. Now, when people tell me it is and I read what the reviewers said
      and all that, I&mdash;I DON&rsquo;T believe, I KNOW it isn&rsquo;t great&mdash;that
      is, the most of it isn&rsquo;t. There is some pretty good stuff, of course, but&mdash;You
      see, I think it wasn&rsquo;t the poems themselves that made it sell; I think it
      was all the fool tommyrot the papers printed about me, about my being a
      hero and all that rubbish, when they thought I was dead, you know. That&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t care about the
      old book. I&rsquo;m not thinking about that. I&rsquo;m thinking about you. YOU aren&rsquo;t
      the same&mdash;the same toward me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toward you, Madeline? I don&rsquo;t understand what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do. Of course you do. If you were the same as you used to be,
      you would let Father help you. We used to talk about that very thing and&mdash;and
      you didn&rsquo;t resent it then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? Well, perhaps I didn&rsquo;t. But I think I remember our speaking
      sometimes of sacrificing everything for each other. We were to live in
      poverty, if necessary, and I was to write, you know, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! All that was nonsense, nonsense! you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m afraid it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know it was. And if you were as you used to be, if you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madeline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Why did you interrupt me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I wanted to ask you a question. Do you think YOU are exactly the
      same&mdash;as you used to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t YOU changed a little? Are you as sure as you were then&mdash;as
      sure of your feeling toward me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, wide-eyed. &ldquo;WHAT do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean ARE you sure? It has seemed to me that perhaps&mdash;I was out of
      your life for a long time, you know, and during a good deal of that time
      it seemed certain that I had gone forever. I am not blaming you, goodness
      knows, but&mdash;Madeline, isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;Well, if I hadn&rsquo;t come back,
      mightn&rsquo;t there have been some one&mdash;else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, inarticulate. &ldquo;Why, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Captain Blanchard, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color came back to her cheeks with a rush. She blushed furiously and
      sprang to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how can you say such things!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What do you mean? How
      DARE you say Captain Blanchard took advantage of&mdash;How&mdash;how DARE
      you say I was not loyal to you? It is not true. It is not true. I was. I
      am. There hasn&rsquo;t been a word&mdash;a word between us since&mdash;since the
      news came that you were&mdash;I told him&mdash;I said&mdash;And he has
      been splendid! Splendid! And now you say&mdash;Oh, what AM I saying? What
      SHALL I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She collapsed once more among the cushions. He leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but she broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I HAVEN&rsquo;T been disloyal,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have tried&mdash;Oh, I have tried
      so hard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Madeline, hush. I understand. I understand perfectly. It is all
      right, really it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should have kept on trying always&mdash;always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, yes. But do you think a married life with so much trying in it
      likely to be a happy one? It is better to know it now, isn&rsquo;t it, a great
      deal better for both of us? Madeline, I am going to my room. I want you to
      think, to think over all this, and then we will talk again. I don&rsquo;t blame
      you. I don&rsquo;t, dear, really. I think I realize everything&mdash;all of it.
      Good night, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed her. She sobbed, but that was all. The next morning
      a servant came to his room with a parcel and a letter. The parcel was a
      tiny one. It was the ring he had given her, in its case. The letter was
      short and much blotted. It read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Albert:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have thought and thought, as you told me to, and I have concluded that
      you were right. It IS best to know it now. Forgive me, please, PLEASE. I
      feel wicked and horrid and I HATE myself, but I think this is best. Oh, do
      forgive me. Good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      MADELINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply was longer. At its end he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I forgive you. In the first place there is nothing to forgive.
      The unforgivable thing would have been the sacrifice of your happiness and
      your future to a dream and a memory. I hope you will be very happy. I am
      sure you will be, for Blanchard is, I know, a fine fellow. The best of
      fortune to you both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next forenoon he sat once more in the car of the morning train for
      Cape Cod, looking out of the window. He had made the journey from New York
      by the night boat and had boarded the Cape train at Middleboro. All the
      previous day, and in the evening as he tramped the cold wind-swept deck of
      the steamer, he had been trying to collect his thoughts, to readjust them
      to the new situation, to comprehend in its entirety the great change that
      had come in his life. The vague plans, the happy indefinite dreams, all
      the rainbows and roses had gone, shivered to bits like the reflection in a
      broken mirror. Madeline, his Madeline, was his no longer. Nor was he hers.
      In a way it seemed impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to analyze his feelings. It seemed as if he should have been
      crushed, grief-stricken, broken. He was inclined to reproach himself
      because he was not. Of course there was a sadness about it, a regret that
      the wonder of those days of love and youth had passed. But the sorrow was
      not bitter, the regret was but a wistful longing, the sweet, lingering
      fragrance of a memory, that was all. Toward her, Madeline, he felt&mdash;and
      it surprised him, too, to find that he felt&mdash;not the slightest trace
      of resentment. And more surprising still he felt none toward Blanchard. He
      had meant what he said in his letter, he wished for them both the greatest
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And&mdash;there was no use attempting to shun the fact&mdash;his chief
      feeling, as he sat there by the car window looking out at the familiar
      landscape, was a great relief, a consciousness of escape from what might
      have been a miserable, crushing mistake for him and for her. And with this
      a growing sense of freedom, of buoyancy. It seemed wicked to feel like
      that. Then it came to him, the thought that Madeline, doubtless, was
      experiencing the same feeling. And he did not mind a bit; he hoped she
      was, bless her!
    </p>
    <p>
      A youthful cigar &ldquo;drummer,&rdquo; on his first Down-East trip, sat down beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of a flat, bare country, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; observed the drummer, with a
      jerk of his head toward the window. &ldquo;Looks bleak enough to me. Know
      anything about this neck of the woods, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning the Cape?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do. I know all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so! Say, you sound as if you liked it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned back to the window again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I love it.&rdquo; Then he sighed, a sigh of
      satisfaction, and added: &ldquo;You see, I BELONG here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His grandparents and Rachel were surprised when he walked into the house
      that noon and announced that he hoped dinner was ready, because he was
      hungry. But their surprise was more than balanced by their joy. Captain
      Zelotes demanded to know how long he was going to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As long as you&rsquo;ll have me, Grandfather,&rdquo; was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Well, that would be a consider&rsquo;ble spell, if you left it to us, but I
      cal&rsquo;late that girl in New York will have somethin&rsquo; to say as to time
      limit, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about that by and by,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not tell them until that evening after supper. It was Friday
      evening and Olive was going to prayer-meeting, but she delayed &ldquo;putting on
      her things&rdquo; to hear the tale. The news that the engagement was off and
      that her grandson was not, after all, to wed the daughter of the Honorable
      Fletcher Fosdick, shocked and grieved her not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I suppose you know what&rsquo;s best, Albert, and
      maybe, as you say, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been happy, but I DID feel sort of
      proud to think my boy was goin&rsquo; to marry a millionaire&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes made no comment&mdash;then. He asked to be told more
      particulars. Albert described the life at the Fosdick home, the
      receptions, his enforced exhibitions and readings. At length the recital
      reached the point of the interview in Fosdick&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he offered you to take you into the firm&mdash;eh, son?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Fosdick, Williamson and Hendricks are one of the biggest brokerage
      houses goin&rsquo;, so a good many New Yorkers have told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. But, Grandfather, you&rsquo;ve had some experience with me as a
      business man; how do you think I would fit into a firm of stockbrokers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote&rsquo;s eye twinkled, but he did not answer the question. Instead
      he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what did you give Fosdick as your reason for not sayin&rsquo; yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. &ldquo;Well, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I said that
      I appreciated his kindness and all that, but that I would not draw a big
      salary for doing nothing except to be a little, damned tame house-poet led
      around in leash and shown off at his wife&rsquo;s club meetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Snow uttered a faint scream. &ldquo;Oh, Albert!&rdquo; she exclaimed. She might
      have said more, but a shout from her husband prevented her doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes had risen and his mighty hand descended with a stinging
      slap upon his grandson&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you, boy!&rdquo; he cried. Then, turning to Olive, he added, &ldquo;Mother,
      I&rsquo;ve always kind of cal&rsquo;lated that you had one man around this house. Now,
      by the Lord A&rsquo;Mighty, I know you&rsquo;ve got TWO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive rose. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she declared emphatically, &ldquo;that may be; but if both
      those men are goin&rsquo; to start in swearin&rsquo; right here in the sittin&rsquo; room, I
      think it&rsquo;s high time SOMEBODY in that family went to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So to prayer meeting she went, with Mrs. Ellis as escort, and her husband
      and grandson, seated in armchairs before the sitting room stove, both
      smoking, talked and talked, of the past and of the future&mdash;not as man
      to boy, nor as grandparent to grandson, but for the first time as equals,
      without reservations, as man to man.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Albert met old Mr. Kendall. After breakfast Captain
      Zelotes had gone, as usual, directly to the office. His grandson, however,
      had not accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to do this mornin&rsquo;, Al?&rdquo; inquired the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know exactly, Grandfather. I&rsquo;m going to look about the place
      a bit, write a letter to my publishers, and take a walk, I think. You will
      probably see me at the office pretty soon. I&rsquo;ll look in there by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to write one or two of those five hundred dollar stories
      before dinner time, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not, sir. I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t be written as quickly as all
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote shook his head. &ldquo;Godfreys!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t the
      writin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em I&rsquo;d worry about so much as the gettin&rsquo; paid for &lsquo;em. You&rsquo;re
      sure that editor man ain&rsquo;t crazy, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he isn&rsquo;t. He seemed sane enough when I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s live and learn, I suppose, but if anybody but
      you had told me that magazine folks paid as much as five hundred dollars a
      piece for yarns made up out of a feller&rsquo;s head without a word of truth in
      &lsquo;em, I&rsquo;d&mdash;well, I should have told the feller that told me to go to a
      doctor right off and have HIS head examined. But&mdash;well, as &lsquo;tis I
      cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;d better have my own looked at. So long, Al. Come in to the
      office if you get a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried out. Albert walked to the window and watched the sturdy figure
      swinging out of the yard. He wondered if, should he live to his
      grandfather&rsquo;s age, his step would be as firm and his shoulders as square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olive laid a hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind his talkin&rsquo; that way about your writin&rsquo; those stories, do
      you, Albert?&rdquo; she asked, a trace of anxiety in her tone. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t mean
      it, you know. He don&rsquo;t understand it&mdash;says he don&rsquo;t himself&mdash;but
      he&rsquo;s awful proud of you, just the same. Why, last night, after you and he
      had finished talkin&rsquo; and he came up to bed&mdash;and the land knows what
      time of night or mornin&rsquo; THAT was&mdash;he woke me out of a sound sleep to
      tell me about that New York magazine man givin&rsquo; you a written order to
      write six stories for his magazine at five hundred dollars a piece.
      Zelotes couldn&rsquo;t seem to get over it. &lsquo;Think of it, Mother,&rsquo; he kept
      sayin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Think of it! Pretty nigh twice what I pay as good a man as Labe
      Keeler for keepin&rsquo; books a whole year. And Al says he ought to do a story
      every forni&rsquo;t. I used to jaw his head off, tellin&rsquo; him he was on the road
      to starvation and all that. Tut, tut, tut! Mother, I&rsquo;ve waited a long time
      to say it, but it looks as if you married a fool.&rsquo; . . . That&rsquo;s the way he
      talked, but he&rsquo;s a long ways from bein&rsquo; a fool, your grandfather is,
      Albert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert nodded. &ldquo;No one knows that better than I,&rdquo; he said, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that kind of troubled me. He said you
      was goin&rsquo; to insist on payin&rsquo; board here at home. Now you know this house
      is yours. And we love to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his arm about her. &ldquo;I know it, Grandmother,&rdquo; he broke in, quickly.
      &ldquo;But that is all settled. I am going to try to make my own living in my
      own way. I am going to write and see what I am really worth. I have my
      royalty money, you know, most of it, and I have this order for the series
      of stories. I can afford to pay for my keep and I shall. You see, as I
      told Grandfather last night, I don&rsquo;t propose to live on his charity any
      more than on Mr. Fosdick&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Zelotes said,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;He told me no less than three times that
      you said it. It seemed to tickle him most to death, for some reason, and
      that&rsquo;s queer, too, for he&rsquo;s anything but stingy. But there, I suppose you
      can pay board if you want to, though who you&rsquo;ll pay it to is another
      thing. <i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t take a cent from the only grandson I&rsquo;ve got in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was while on his stroll down to the village that Albert met Mr.
      Kendall. The reverend gentleman was plodding along carrying a market
      basket from the end of which, beneath a fragment of newspaper, the tail
      and rear third of a huge codfish drooped. The basket and its contents must
      have weighed at least twelve pounds and the old minister was, as Captain
      Zelotes would have said, making heavy weather of it. Albert went to his
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Kendall,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that basket is rather
      heavy, isn&rsquo;t it. Mayn&rsquo;t I help you with it?&rdquo; Then, seeing that the old
      gentleman did not recognize him, he added, &ldquo;I am Albert Speranza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down went the basket and the codfish and Mr. Kendall seized him by both
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, of course,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Of course, of course. It&rsquo;s our
      young hero, isn&rsquo;t it. Our poet, our happy warrior. Yes,&mdash;yes, of
      course. So glad to see you, Albert. . . . Er . . . er . . . How is your
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean my grandmother? She is very well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;yes, your grandmother, of course. . . . Er . . . er. .
      . . Did you see my codfish? Isn&rsquo;t it a magnificent one. I am very fond of
      codfish and we almost never have it at home. So just now, I happened to be
      passing Jonathan Howes&rsquo;&mdash;he is the&mdash;er&mdash;fishdealer, you
      know, and . . . Jonathan is a very regular attendant at my Sunday morning
      services. He is&mdash;is. . . . Dear me. . . . What was I about to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being switched back to the main track by Albert he explained that he had
      seen a number of cod in Mr. Howes&rsquo; possession and had bought this
      specimen. Howes had lent him the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the newspaper,&rdquo; he explained; adding, with triumph, &ldquo;I shall dine on
      codfish to-day, I am happy to say.&rdquo; Judging by appearances he might dine
      and sup and breakfast on codfish and still have a supply remaining. Albert
      insisted on carrying the spoil to the parsonage. He was doing nothing in
      particular and it would be a pleasure, he said. Mr. Kendall protested for
      the first minute or so but then forgot just what the protest was all about
      and rambled garrulously on about affairs in the parish. He had failed in
      other faculties, but his flow of language was still unimpeded. They
      entered the gate of the parsonage. Albert put the basket on the upper
      step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;now I must go. Good morning, Mr. Kendall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you aren&rsquo;t going? You must come in a moment. I want to give you
      the manuscript of that sermon of mine on the casting down of Baal, that is
      the one in which I liken the military power of Germany to the brazen idol
      which. . . . Just a moment, Albert. The manuscript is in my desk and. . .
      . Oh, dear me, the door is locked. . . . Helen, Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was shaking the door and shouting his daughter&rsquo;s name. Albert was
      surprised and not a little disturbed. It had not occurred to him that
      Helen could be at home. It is true that before he left for New York his
      grandmother had said that she was planning to return home to be with her
      father, but since then he had heard nothing more concerning her. Neither
      of his grandparents had mentioned her name in their letters, nor since his
      arrival the day before had they mentioned it. And Mr. Kendall had not
      spoken of her during their walk together. Albert was troubled and taken
      aback. In one way he would have liked to meet Helen very much indeed. They
      had not met since before the war. But he did not, somehow, wish to meet
      her just then. He did not wish to meet anyone who would speak of Madeline,
      or ask embarrassing questions. He turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time, Mr. Kendall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had gone only a few yards when the reverend gentleman was calling
      to him to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Albert! Albert!&rdquo; called Mr. Kendall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to turn back, he could do nothing else, and as he did so
      the door opened. It was Helen who opened it and she stood there upon the
      threshold and looked down at him. For a moment, a barely perceptible
      interval, she looked, then he heard her catch her breath quickly and saw
      her put one hand upon the door jamb as if for support. The next, and she
      was running down the steps, her hands outstretched and the light of
      welcome in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Albert Speranza!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, ALBERT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hands. &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; he cried, and added involuntarily, &ldquo;My, but
      it&rsquo;s good to see you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and so did he. All his embarrassment was gone. They were like
      two children, like the boy and girl who had known each other in the old
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when did you get here?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And what do you mean by
      surprising us like this? I saw your grandfather yesterday morning and he
      didn&rsquo;t say a word about your coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know I was coming. I didn&rsquo;t know it myself until the day
      before. And when did you come? Your father didn&rsquo;t tell me you were here. I
      didn&rsquo;t know until I heard him call your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was calling it again. Calling it and demanding attention for his
      precious codfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Father, yes, in a minute,&rdquo; she said. Then to Albert, &ldquo;Come in. Oh,
      of course you&rsquo;ll come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, if I won&rsquo;t be interfering with the housekeeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t. Yes, Father, yes, I&rsquo;m coming. Mercy, where did you get such a
      wonderful fish? Come in, Albert. As soon as I get Father&rsquo;s treasure safe
      in the hands of Maria I&rsquo;ll be back. Father will keep you company. No,
      pardon me, I am afraid he won&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;s gone to the kitchen already. And I
      shall have to go, too, for just a minute. I&rsquo;ll hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to the kitchen, whither Mr. Kendall, tugging the fish basket,
      had preceded her. Albert entered the little sitting-room and sat down in a
      chair by the window. The room looked just as it used to look, just as
      neat, just as homelike, just as well kept. And when she came back and they
      began to talk, it seemed to him that she, too, was just as she used to be.
      She was a trifle less girlish, more womanly perhaps, but she was just as
      good to look at, just as bright and cheerful and in her conversation she
      had the same quietly certain way of dealing directly with the common-sense
      realities and not the fuss and feathers. It seemed to him that she had not
      changed at all, that she herself was one of the realities, the wholesome
      home realities, like Captain Zelotes and Olive and the old house they
      lived in. He told her so. She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me feel as ancient as the pyramids,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I am the ancient,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;This war hasn&rsquo;t
      changed you a particle, Helen, but it has handed me an awful jolt. At
      times I feel as if I must have sailed with Noah. And as if I had wasted
      most of the time since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. &ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I do mean, I guess. I seem
      to have an unsettled feeling. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with myself. And as I
      remember myself,&rdquo; he added, with a shrug, &ldquo;that condition of mind was not
      usual with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him for a moment without speaking, with the appraising look
      in her eyes which he remembered so well, which had always reminded him of
      the look in his grandfather&rsquo;s eyes, and which when a boy he resented so
      strongly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I think you have changed. Not because you say you
      feel so much older or because you are uneasy and dissatisfied. So many of
      the men I talked with at the camp hospital, the men who had been over
      there and had been wounded, as you were, said they felt the same way. That
      doesn&rsquo;t mean anything, I think, except that it is dreadfully hard to get
      readjusted again and settle down to everyday things. But it seems to me
      that you have changed in other ways. You are a little thinner, but
      broader, too, aren&rsquo;t you? And you do look older, especially about the
      eyes. And, of course&mdash;well, of course I think I do miss a little of
      the Albert Speranza I used to know, the young chap with the chip on his
      shoulder for all creation to knock off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young jackass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no indeed. He had his good points. But there! we&rsquo;re wasting time and
      we have so much to talk about. You&mdash;why, what am I thinking of! I
      have neglected the most important thing in the world. And you have just
      returned from New York, too. Tell me, how is Madeline Fosdick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is well. But tell me about yourself. You have been in all sorts of
      war work, haven&rsquo;t you. Tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my work didn&rsquo;t amount to much. At first I &lsquo;Red Crossed&rsquo; in Boston,
      then I went to Devens and spent a long time in the camp hospital there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty trying, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, some of it was. When the &lsquo;flu&rsquo; epidemic was raging and the
      poor fellows were having such a dreadful time it was bad enough. After
      that I was sent to Eastview. In the hospital there I met the boys who had
      been wounded on the other side and who talked about old age and
      dissatisfaction and uneasiness, just as you do. But MY work doesn&rsquo;t count.
      You are the person to be talked about. Since I have seen you you have
      become a famous poet and a hero and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been smiling; now she was very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Albert,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have been joking, you and I, but there
      was a time when we&mdash;when your friends did not joke. Oh, Albert, if
      you could have seen the Snow place as I saw it then. It was as if all the
      hope and joy and everything worth while had been crushed out of it. Your
      grandmother, poor little woman, was brave and quiet, but we all knew she
      was trying to keep up for Captain Zelotes&rsquo; sake. And he&mdash;Albert, you
      can scarcely imagine how the news of your death changed him. . . . Ah!
      well, it was a hard time, a dreadful time for&mdash;for every one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and he, turning to look at her, saw that there were tears in
      her eyes. He knew of her affection for his grandparents and theirs for
      her. Before he could speak she was smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now that is all over, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And the Snows are the
      happiest people in the country, I do believe. AND the proudest, of course.
      So now you must tell me all about it, about your experiences, and about
      your war cross, and about your literary work&mdash;oh, about everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The all-inclusive narrative was not destined to get very far. Old Mr.
      Kendall came hurrying in, the sermon on the casting down of Baal in his
      hand. Thereafter he led, guided, and to a large extent monopolized the
      conversation. His discourse had proceeded perhaps as far as &ldquo;Thirdly&rdquo; when
      Albert, looking at his watch, was surprised to find it almost dinner time.
      Mr. Kendall, still talking, departed to his study to hunt for another
      sermon. The young people said good-by in his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been awfully good to see you again, Helen,&rdquo; declared Albert. &ldquo;But
      I told you that in the beginning, didn&rsquo;t I? You seem like&mdash;well, like
      a part of home, you know. And home means something to me nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you speak of South Harniss as home. Of course I know you
      don&rsquo;t mean to make it a permanent home&mdash;I imagine Madeline would have
      something to say about that&mdash;but it is nice to have you speak as if
      the old town meant something to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love the place,&rdquo; he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad. So do I; but then I have lived here all my life. The next time
      we talk I want to know more about your plans for the future&mdash;yours
      and Madeline&rsquo;s, I mean. How proud she must be of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her; she was standing upon the upper step and he on the
      walk below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madeline and I&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Then he stopped. What was the use? He
      did not want to talk about it. He waved his hand and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner he went out into the kitchen to talk to Mrs. Ellis, who was
      washing dishes. She was doing it as she did all her share of the
      housework, with an energy and capability which would have delighted the
      soul of a &ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; expert. Except when under the spell of a
      sympathetic attack Rachel was ever distinctly on the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course she was, as always, glad to see her protege, her Robert
      Penfold. The proprietary interest which she had always felt in him was
      more than ever hers now. Had not she been the sole person to hint at the
      possibility of his being alive, when every one else had given him up for
      dead? Had not she been the only one to suggest that he might have been
      taken prisoner? Had SHE ever despaired of seeing him again&mdash;on this
      earth and in the flesh? Indeed, she had not; at least, she had never
      admitted it, if she had. So then, hadn&rsquo;t she a RIGHT to feel that she
      owned a share in him? No one ventured to dispute that right.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and smiled over one ample shoulder when he entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; she hailed cheerfully. &ldquo;Come callin&rsquo;, have you, Robert&mdash;Albert,
      I mean? It would have been a great help to me if you&rsquo;d been christened
      Robert. I call you that so much to myself it comes almost more natural
      than the other. On account of you bein&rsquo; so just like Robert Penfold in the
      book, you know,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course, Rachel, I understand,&rdquo; put in Albert hastily. He was
      not in the mood to listen to a dissertation on a text taken from Foul
      Play. He looked about the room and sighed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a speck anywhere, is there?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;It is just as it
      used to be, just as I used to think of it when I was laid up over there.
      When I wanted to try and eat a bit, so as to keep what strength I had, I
      would think about this kitchen of yours, Rachel. It didn&rsquo;t do to think of
      the places where the prison stuff was cooked. They were not&mdash;appetizing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis nodded. &ldquo;I presume likely not,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t tell
      me about &lsquo;em. I&rsquo;ve just scrubbed this kitchen from stem to stern. If I
      heard about those prison places, I&rsquo;d feel like startin&rsquo; right in and
      scrubbin&rsquo; it all over again, I know I should. . . . Dirty pigs! I wish I
      had the scourin&rsquo; of some of those Germans! I&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know as I
      wouldn&rsquo;t skin &lsquo;em alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. &ldquo;Some of them pretty nearly deserved it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rachel smiled grimly. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s talk about nice things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh,
      Issy Price was here this forenoon; Cap&rsquo;n Lote sent him over from the
      office on an errand, and he said he saw you and Mr. Kendall goin&rsquo; down
      street together just as he was comin&rsquo; along. He hollered at you, but you
      didn&rsquo;t hear him. &lsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to Issachar&rsquo;s tell, you was luggin&rsquo; a basket
      with Jonah&rsquo;s whale in it, or somethin&rsquo; like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert described his encounter with the minister. Rachel was much
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so you saw Helen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, I guess she was surprised to see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than I was to see her. I didn&rsquo;t know she was in town. Not a soul
      had mentioned it&mdash;you nor Grandfather nor Grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper answered without turning her head. &ldquo;Guess we had so many
      things to talk about we forgot it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s been here over a
      week now. High time, from what I hear. The poor old parson has failed
      consider&rsquo;ble and Maria Price&rsquo;s housekeepin&rsquo; and cookin&rsquo; is enough to make
      a well man sick&mdash;or wish he was. But he&rsquo;ll be looked after now. Helen
      will look after him. She&rsquo;s the most capable girl there is in Ostable
      County. Did she tell you about what she done in the Red Cross and the
      hospitals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said something about it, not very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. She wouldn&rsquo;t, bein&rsquo; Helen Kendall. But the Red Cross folks said
      enough, and they&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo; it yet. Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on to tell of Helen&rsquo;s work in the Red Cross depots and in the
      camp, and hospitals. It was an inspiring story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There they was,&rdquo; said Rachel, &ldquo;the poor things, just boys most of &lsquo;em,
      dyin&rsquo; of that dreadful influenza like rats, as you might say. And, of
      course it&rsquo;s dreadful catchin&rsquo;, and a good many was more afraid of it than
      they would have been of bullets, enough sight. But Helen Kendall wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      afraid&mdash;no, siree! Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so on. Albert listened, hearing most of it, but losing some as his
      thoughts wandered back to the Helen he had known as a boy and the Helen he
      had met that forenoon. Her face, as she had welcomed him at the parsonage
      door&mdash;it was surprising how clearly it showed before his mind&rsquo;s eye.
      He had thought at first that she had not changed in appearance. That was
      not quite true&mdash;she had changed a little, but it was merely the
      fulfillment of a promise, that was all. Her eyes, her smile above a
      hospital bed&mdash;he could imagine what they must have seemed like to a
      lonely, homesick boy wrestling with the &ldquo;flu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; he heard the housekeeper say, as he drifted out of his
      reverie, &ldquo;if she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t popular around that hospital, around both
      hospitals, fur&rsquo;s that goes! The patients idolized her, and the other
      nurses they loved her, and the doctors&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they love her, too?&rdquo; Albert asked, with a smile, as she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;Some of &lsquo;em did, I cal&rsquo;late,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You see, I got
      most of my news about it all from Bessie Ryder, Cornelius Ryder&rsquo;s niece,
      lives up on the road to the Center; you used to know her, Albert. Bessie
      was nursin&rsquo; in that same hospital, the one Helen was at first. &lsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to
      her, there was some doctor or officer tryin&rsquo; to shine up to Helen most of
      the time. When she was at Eastview, so Bessie heard, there was a real
      big-bug in the Army, a sort of Admiral or Commodore amongst the doctors he
      was, and HE was trottin&rsquo; after her, or would have been if she&rsquo;d let him.
      &lsquo;Course you have to make some allowances for Bessie&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t be
      a Ryder if she didn&rsquo;t take so many words to say so little that the truth
      gets stretched pretty thin afore she finished&mdash;but there must have
      been SOMETHIN&rsquo; in it. And all about her bein&rsquo; such a wonderful nurse and
      doin&rsquo; so much for the Red Cross I KNOW is true. . . . Eh? Did you say
      anything, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head. &ldquo;No, Rachel,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard you or somebody say somethin&rsquo;. I&mdash;Why, Laban
      Keeler, what are you doin&rsquo; away from your desk this time in the
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban grinned as he entered the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I hear you say you thought you heard somebody sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;,
      Rachel?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer, ain&rsquo;t it? Seemed to me <i>I</i> heard
      somebody sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; as I come up the path just now. Seemed as if
      they was sayin&rsquo; it right here in the kitchen, too. &lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t your voice,
      Albert, and it couldn&rsquo;t have been Rachel&rsquo;s, &lsquo;cause she NEVER talks&mdash;&lsquo;specially
      to you. It&rsquo;s too bad, the prejudice she&rsquo;s got against you, Albert,&rdquo; he
      added, with a wink. &ldquo;Um-hm, too bad&mdash;yes, &lsquo;tis&mdash;yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what the newspapers in war time used to call&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;oh,
      dear, what was it?&mdash;camel&mdash;seems&rsquo;s if &lsquo;twas somethin&rsquo; about a
      camel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Camouflage?&rdquo; suggested Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. All that talk about me is just camouflage to save him
      answerin&rsquo; my question. But he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to answer it. What are you doin&rsquo; 
      away from the office this time in the afternoon, I want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler perched his small figure on the corner of the kitchen table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, Rachel,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to do
      what the folks in books call demand an explanation. You and I, Rachel, are
      just as good as engaged to be married, ain&rsquo;t we? I&rsquo;ve been keepin&rsquo; company
      with you for the last twenty, forty or sixty years, some such spell as
      that. Now, just as I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; used to it and beginnin&rsquo; to consider it a
      settled arrangement, as you may say, I come into this house and find you
      shut up in the kitchen with another man. Now, what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper advanced toward him with the dripping dishcloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laban Keeler,&rdquo; she threatened, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t stop your foolishness and
      answer my question, I declare I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban slid from his perch and retired behind the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another man,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And SOME folks&mdash;not many, of course, but
      some&mdash;might be crazy enough to say he was a better-lookin&rsquo; man than I
      am. Now, bein&rsquo; ragin&rsquo; jealous,&mdash;All right, Rachel, all right, I
      surrender. Don&rsquo;t hit me with all those soapsuds. I don&rsquo;t want to go back
      to the office foamin&rsquo; at the mouth. The reason I&rsquo;m here is that I had to
      go down street to see about the sheathin&rsquo; for the Red Men&rsquo;s lodge room.
      Issy took the order, but he wasn&rsquo;t real sure whether &lsquo;twas sheathin&rsquo; or
      scantlin&rsquo; they wanted, so I told Cap&rsquo;n Lote I&rsquo;d run down myself and
      straighten it out. On the way back I saw you two through the window and I
      thought I&rsquo;d drop in and worry you. So here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellis nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;And all that camel&mdash;camel&mdash;Oh,
      DEAR, what DOES ail me? All that camel&mdash;No use, I&rsquo;ve forgot it
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Rachel,&rdquo; said Mr. Keeler consolingly. &ldquo;All the&mdash;er&mdash;menagerie
      was just that and nothin&rsquo; more. Oh, by the way, Al,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;speakin&rsquo; 
      of camels&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;ve done pretty well to go so long
      without any&mdash;er&mdash;liquid nourishment? Not a drop since you and I
      enlisted together. . . . Oh, she knows about it now,&rdquo; he added, with a
      jerk of his head in the housekeeper&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;I felt &lsquo;twas fairly safe
      and settled, so I told her. I told her. Yes, yes, yes. Um-hm, so I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert turned to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should be very proud of him, Rachel,&rdquo; he said seriously. &ldquo;I think I
      realize a little something of the fight he has made, and it is bully. You
      should be proud of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel looked down at the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I guess likely he knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban smiled. &ldquo;The folks in Washington are doin&rsquo; their best to help me
      out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to take the stuff away from everybody so&rsquo;s
      to make sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t get any more. They&rsquo;ll probably put up a
      monument to me for startin&rsquo; the thing; don&rsquo;t you think they will, Al? Eh?
      Don&rsquo;t you, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert and he walked up the road together. Laban told a little more of his
      battle with John Barleycorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had half a dozen spells when I had to set my teeth, those I&rsquo;ve got
      left, and hang on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And the hangin&rsquo;-on wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t as easy as
      stickin&rsquo; to fly-paper, neither. Honest, though, I think the hardest was
      when the news came that you was alive, Al. I&mdash;I just wanted to start
      in and celebrate. Wanted to whoop her up, I did.&rdquo; He paused a moment and
      then added, &ldquo;I tried whoopin&rsquo; on sass&rsquo;parilla and vanilla sody, but
      &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t satisfactory. Couldn&rsquo;t seem to raise a real loud whisper, let
      alone a whoop. No, I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;no, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed and laid a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Labe,&rdquo;
       he declared. &ldquo;I know you, and I say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban slowly shook his head. His smile, as he answered, was rather
      pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a long, long ways from bein&rsquo; all right, Al,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A long ways
      from that, I am. If I&rsquo;d made my fight thirty year ago, I might have been
      nigher to amountin&rsquo; to somethin&rsquo;. . . . Oh, well, for Rachel&rsquo;s sake I&rsquo;m
      glad I&rsquo;ve made it now. She&rsquo;s stuck to me when everybody would have praised
      her for chuckin&rsquo; me to Tophet. I was readin&rsquo; one of Thackeray&rsquo;s books
      t&rsquo;other night&mdash;Henry Esmond, &lsquo;twas; you&rsquo;ve read it, Al, of course; I
      was readin&rsquo; it t&rsquo;other night for the ninety-ninth time or thereabouts, and
      I run across the place where it says it&rsquo;s strange what a man can do and a
      woman still keep thinkin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s an angel. That&rsquo;s true, too, Al. Not,&rdquo; with
      the return of the slight smile, &ldquo;that Rachel ever went so far as to call
      me an angel. No, no. There&rsquo;s limits where you can&rsquo;t stretch her
      common-sense any farther. Callin&rsquo; me an angel would be just past the
      limit. Yes, yes, yes. I guess SO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of Captain Zelotes and Olive and of their grief and
      discouragement when the news of Albert&rsquo;s supposed death reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Labe, &ldquo;I believe Helen Kendall&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; there for a
      week did &lsquo;em more good than anything else. She got away from her soldier
      nursin&rsquo; somehow&mdash;must have been able to pull the strings consider&rsquo;ble
      harder&rsquo;n the average to do it&mdash;and just came down to the Snow place
      and sort of took charge along with Rachel. Course she didn&rsquo;t live there,
      her father thought she was visitin&rsquo; him, I guess likely, but she was with
      Cap&rsquo;n Lote and Olive most of the time. Rachel says she never made a fuss,
      you understand, just was there and helped and was quiet and soft-spoken
      and capable and&mdash;and comfortin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s about the word, I guess.
      Rachel always thought a sight of Helen afore that, but since then she
      swears by her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening&mdash;or, rather, that night, for they did not leave the
      sitting room until after twelve&mdash;Mrs. Snow heard her grandson walking
      the floor of his room, and called to ask if he was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, Grandmother,&rdquo; he called in reply. &ldquo;Just taking a little
      exercise before turning in, that&rsquo;s all. Sorry if I disturbed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exercise was, as a matter of fact, almost entirely mental, the pacing
      up and down merely an unconscious physical accompaniment. Albert Speranza
      was indulging in introspection. He was reviewing and assorting his
      thoughts and his impulses and trying to determine just what they were and
      why they were and whither they were tending. It was a mental and spiritual
      picking to pieces and the result was humiliating and in its turn resulted
      in a brand-new determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since his meeting with Helen, a meeting which had been quite
      unpremeditated, he had thought of but little except her. During his talk
      with her in the parsonage sitting room he had been&mdash;there was no use
      pretending to himself that it was otherwise&mdash;more contented with the
      world, more optimistic, happier, than he had been for months, it seemed to
      him for years. Even while he was speaking to her of his uneasiness and
      dissatisfaction he was dimly conscious that at that moment he was less
      uneasy and less dissatisfied, conscious that the solid ground was beneath
      his feet at last, that here was the haven after the storm, here was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled up sharply. This line of thought was silly, dangerous, wicked.
      What did it mean? Three days before, only three days, he had left Madeline
      Fosdick, the girl whom he had worshiped, adored, and who had loved him.
      Yes, there was no use pretending there, either; he and Madeline HAD loved
      each other. Of course he realized now that their love had nothing
      permanently substantial about it. It was the romance of youth, a dream
      which they had shared together and from which, fortunately for both, they
      had awakened in time. And of course he realized, too, that the awakening
      had begun long, long before the actual parting took place. But
      nevertheless only three days had elapsed since that parting, and now&mdash;What
      sort of a man was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he like his father? Was it what Captain Zelotes used to call the
      &ldquo;Portygee streak&rdquo; which was now cropping out? The opera singer had been of
      the butterfly type&mdash;in his later years a middle-aged butterfly whose
      wings creaked somewhat&mdash;but decidedly a flitter from flower to
      flower. As a boy, Albert had been aware, in an uncertain fashion, of his
      father&rsquo;s fondness for the sex. Now, older, his judgment of his parent was
      not as lenient, was clearer, more discerning. He understood now. Was his
      own &ldquo;Portygee streak,&rdquo; his inherited temperament, responsible for his
      leaving one girl on a Tuesday and on Friday finding his thoughts concerned
      so deeply with another?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no matter, no matter. One thing was certain&mdash;Helen should never
      know of that feeling. He would crush it down, he would use his
      common-sense. He would be a decent man and not a blackguard. For he had
      had his chance and had tossed it away. What would she think of him now if
      he came to her after Madeline had thrown him over&mdash;that is what Mrs.
      Fosdick would say, would take pains that every one else should say, that
      Madeline had thrown him over&mdash;what would Helen think of him if he
      came to her with a second-hand love like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      And of course she would not think of him as a lover at all. Why should
      she? In the boy and girl days she had refused to let him speak of such a
      thing. She was his friend, a glorious, a wonderful friend, but that was
      all, all she ever dreamed of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was right; that was as it should be. He should be thankful for
      such a friend. He was, of course. And he would concentrate all his
      energies upon his work, upon his writing. That was it, that was it. Good,
      it was settled!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went to bed and, eventually, to sleep.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      While dressing in the cold light of dawn his perturbations of the previous
      night appeared in retrospect as rather boyish and unnecessary. His sudden
      and unexpected meeting with Helen and their talk together had tended to
      make him over-sentimental, that was all. He and she were to be friends, of
      course, but there was no real danger of his allowing himself to think of
      her except as a friend. No, indeed. He opened the bureau drawer in search
      of a tie, and there was the package of &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; just where he had
      tossed them that night when he first returned home after muster-out.
      Helen&rsquo;s photograph was the uppermost. He looked at it&mdash;looked at it
      for several minutes. Then he closed the drawer again and hurriedly
      finished his dressing. A part, at least, of his resolve of the night
      before had been sound common-sense. His brain was suffering from lack of
      exercise. Work was what he needed, hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to work he went without delay. A place to work in was the first
      consideration. He suggested the garret, but his grandmother and Rachel
      held up their hands and lifted their voices in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, INDEED,&rdquo; declared Olive. &ldquo;Zelotes has always talked about writin&rsquo; 
      folks and poets starvin&rsquo; in garrets. If you went up attic to work he&rsquo;d be
      teasin&rsquo; me from mornin&rsquo; to night. Besides, you&rsquo;d freeze up there, if the
      smell of moth-balls didn&rsquo;t choke you first. No, you wait; I&rsquo;ve got a
      notion. There&rsquo;s that old table desk of Zelotes&rsquo; in the settin&rsquo; room. He
      don&rsquo;t hardly ever use it nowadays. You take it upstairs to your own room
      and work in there. You can have the oil-heater to keep you warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that was the arrangement made, and in his own room Albert sat down at
      the battered old desk, which had been not only his grandfather&rsquo;s but his
      great-grandfather&rsquo;s property, to concentrate upon the first of the series
      of stories ordered by the New York magazine. He had already decided upon
      the general scheme for the series. A boy, ragamuffin son of immigrant
      parents, rising, after a wrong start, by sheer grit and natural shrewdness
      and ability, step by step to competence and success, winning a place in
      and the respect of a community. There was nothing new in the idea itself.
      Some things his soldier chum Mike Kelley had told him concerning an uncle
      of his&mdash;Mike&rsquo;s&mdash;suggested it. The novelty he hoped might come
      from the incidents, the various problems faced by his hero, the solution
      of each being a step upward in the latter&rsquo;s career and in the formation of
      his character. He wanted to write, if he could, the story of the building
      of one more worth-while American, for Albert Speranza, like so many others
      set to thinking by the war and the war experiences, was realizing strongly
      that the gabbling of a formula and the swearing of an oath of
      naturalization did not necessarily make an American. There were too many
      eager to take that oath with tongue in cheek and knife in sleeve. Too
      many, for the first time in their lives breathing and speaking as free
      men, thanks to the protection of Columbia&rsquo;s arm, yet planning to stab
      their protectress in the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Albert&rsquo;s hero was to be an American, an American to whom the term meant
      the highest and the best. If he had hunted a lifetime for something to
      please and interest his grandfather he could not have hit the mark nearer
      the center. Cap&rsquo;n Lote, of course, pretended a certain measure of
      indifference, but that was for Olive and Rachel&rsquo;s benefit. It would never
      do for the scoffer to become a convert openly and at once. The feminine
      members of the household clamored each evening to have the author read
      aloud his day&rsquo;s installment. The captain sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, dear,&rdquo; with a groan, &ldquo;now I&rsquo;ve got to hear all that made-up
      stuff that happened to a parcel of made-up folks that never lived and
      never will. Waste of time, waste of time. Where&rsquo;s my Transcript?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was noticed&mdash;and commented upon, you may be sure&mdash;by his
      wife and housekeeper that the Transcript was likely to be, before the
      reading had progressed far, either in the captain&rsquo;s lap or on the floor.
      And when the discussion following the reading was under way Captain
      Zelotes&rsquo; opinions were expressed quite as freely as any one&rsquo;s else. Laban
      Keeler got into the habit of dropping in to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fateful evening the reading was interrupted by the arrival of Mr.
      Kendall. The reverend gentleman had come to make a pastoral call. Albert&rsquo;s
      hero was in the middle of a situation. The old clergyman insisted upon the
      continuation of the reading. It was continued and so was the discussion
      following it; in fact, the discussion seemed likely to go on indefinitely,
      for the visitor showed no inclination of leaving. At ten-thirty his
      daughter appeared to inquire about him and to escort him home. Then he
      went, but under protest. Albert walked to the parsonage with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve started somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; groaned the captain, as the door closed.
      &ldquo;That old critter&rsquo;ll be cruisin&rsquo; over here six nights out of five from now
      on to tell Al just how to spin those yarns of his. And he&rsquo;ll talk&mdash;and
      talk&mdash;and talk. Ain&rsquo;t it astonishin&rsquo; how such a feeble-lookin&rsquo; craft
      as he is can keep blowin&rsquo; off steam that way and still be able to
      navigate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife took him to task. &ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;of your callin&rsquo; 
      your own minister a &lsquo;critter&rsquo;! I should think you&rsquo;d be ashamed. . . . But,
      oh, dear, I&rsquo;m afraid he WILL be over here an awful lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fears were realized. Mr. Kendall, although not on hand &ldquo;six nights out
      of five,&rdquo; as the captain prophesied, was a frequent visitor at the Snow
      place. As Albert&rsquo;s story-writing progressed the discussions concerning the
      growth and development of the hero&rsquo;s character became more and more
      involved and spirited. They were for the most part confined, when the
      minister was present, to him and Mrs. Snow and Rachel. Laban, if he
      happened to be there, sat well back in the corner, saying little except
      when appealed to, and then answering with one of his dry, characteristic
      observations. Captain Lote, in the rocker, his legs crossed, his hand
      stroking his beard, and with the twinkle in his eyes, listened, and spoke
      but seldom. Occasionally, when he and his grandson exchanged glances, the
      captain winked, indicating appreciation of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Al,&rdquo; he said, one evening, after the old clergyman had departed, &ldquo;it
      must be kind of restful to have your work all laid out for you this way.
      Take it to-night, for instance; I don&rsquo;t see but what everything&rsquo;s planned
      for this young feller you&rsquo;re writin&rsquo; about so you nor he won&rsquo;t have to
      think for yourselves for a hundred year or such matter. Course there&rsquo;s
      some little difference in the plans. Rachel wants him to get wrecked on an
      island or be put in jail, and Mother, she wants him to be a soldier and a
      poet, and Mr. Kendall thinks it&rsquo;s high time he joined the church or signed
      the pledge or stopped swearin&rsquo; or chewin&rsquo; gum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zelotes, how ridiculous you do talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mother, all right. What strikes me, Al, is they don&rsquo;t any of
      &lsquo;em stop to ask you what YOU mean to have him do. Course I know &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      any of your business, but still&mdash;seems &lsquo;s if you might be a little
      mite interested in the boy yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Grandfather,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m enjoying it all
      very much. And some of the suggestions may be just what I&rsquo;m looking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, son, we&rsquo;ll hope so. Say, Labe, I&rsquo;ve got a notion for keepin&rsquo; the
      minister from doin&rsquo; all the talkin.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll ask Issy Price to drop in; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Sounds to
      me a good deal like lettin&rsquo; in a hurricane to blow out a match with. . . .
      Um-hm. Seems so to me. Yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendall&rsquo;s calls would have been more frequent still had Helen not
      interfered. Very often, when he came she herself dropped in a little later
      and insisted upon his making an early start for home. Occasionally she
      came with him. She, too, seemed much interested in the progress of the
      stories, but she offered few suggestions. When directly appealed to, she
      expressed her views, and they were worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert was resolutely adhering to his determination not to permit himself
      to think of her except as a friend. That is, he hoped he was; thoughts are
      hard to control at times. He saw her often. They met on the street, at
      church on Sunday&mdash;his grandmother was so delighted when he
      accompanied her to &ldquo;meeting&rdquo; that he did so rather more frequently,
      perhaps, than he otherwise would&mdash;at the homes of acquaintances, and,
      of course, at the Snow place. When she walked home with her father after a
      &ldquo;story evening&rdquo; he usually went with them as additional escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not questioned him concerning Madeline since their first meeting
      that morning at the parsonage. He knew, therefore, that some one&mdash;his
      grandmother, probably&mdash;had told her of the broken engagement. When
      they were alone together they talked of many things, casual things, the
      generalities of which, so he told himself, a conversation between mere
      friends was composed. But occasionally, after doing escort duty, after Mr.
      Kendall had gone into the house to take his &ldquo;throat medicine&rdquo;&mdash;a
      medicine which Captain Zelotes declared would have to be double-strength
      pretty soon to offset the wear and tear of the story evenings&mdash;they
      talked of matters more specific and which more directly concerned
      themselves. She spoke of her hospital work, of her teaching before the
      war, and of her plans for the future. The latter, of course, were very
      indefinite now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father needs me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I shall not leave him while he lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of Albert&rsquo;s work and plans most of all. He began to ask for
      advice concerning the former. When those stories were written, what then?
      She hoped he would try the novel he had hinted at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can do it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t give up the poems
      altogether. It was the poetry, you know, which was the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU were the beginning,&rdquo; he said impulsively. &ldquo;Perhaps I should never
      have written at all if you hadn&rsquo;t urged me, shamed me out of my laziness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a presuming young person, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder you
      didn&rsquo;t tell me to mind my own business. I believe you did, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      June brought the summer weather and the summer boarders to South Harniss.
      One of the news sensations which came at the same time was that the new
      Fosdick cottage had been sold. The people who had occupied it the previous
      season had bought it. Mrs. Fosdick, so rumor said, was not strong and her
      doctors had decided that the sea air did not agree with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crimustee!&rdquo; exclaimed Issachar, as he imparted the news to Mr. Keeler,
      &ldquo;if that ain&rsquo;t the worst. Spend your money, and a pile of money, too,
      buyin&rsquo; ground, layin&rsquo; of it out to build a house on to live in, then
      buildin&rsquo; that house and then, by crimus, sellin&rsquo; it to somebody else for
      THEM to live in. That beats any foolishness ever come MY way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s some consider&rsquo;ble come your way at that, ain&rsquo;t they, Is?&rdquo;
       observed Laban, busy with his bookkeeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issachar nodded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there has,&rdquo; he said complacently. &ldquo;I . . .
      What do you mean by that? Tryin&rsquo; to be funny again, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert heard the news with a distinct feeling of relief. While the feeling
      on his part toward Madeline was of the kindliest, and Madeline&rsquo;s was, he
      felt sure, the same toward him, nevertheless to meet her day after day, as
      people must meet in a village no bigger than South Harniss, would be
      awkward for both. And to meet Mrs. Fosdick might be more awkward still. He
      smiled as he surmised that the realization by the lady of that very
      awkwardness was probably responsible for the discovery that sea air was
      not beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story-writing and the story evenings continued. Over the fourth story
      in the series discussion was warm, for there were marked differences of
      opinion among the listeners. One of the experiences through which Albert
      had brought his hero was that of working as general assistant to a sharp,
      unscrupulous and smooth-tongued rascal who was proprietor of a circus
      sideshow and fake museum. He was a kind-hearted swindler, but one who
      never let a question of honesty interfere with the getting of a dollar. In
      this fourth story, to the town where the hero, now a man of twenty-five,
      had established himself in business, came this cheat of other days, but
      now he came as a duly ordained clergyman in answer to the call of the
      local church. The hero learned that he had not told the governing body of
      that church of his former career. Had he done so, they most certainly
      would not have called him. The leading man in that church body was the
      hero&rsquo;s patron and kindest friend. The question: What was the hero&rsquo;s duty
      in the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the first question asked was whether or not the ex-sideshow
      proprietor was sincerely repentant and honestly trying to walk the
      straight path and lead others along it. Albert replied that his hero had
      interviewed him and was satisfied that he was; he had been &ldquo;converted&rdquo; at
      a revival and was now a religious enthusiast whose one idea was to save
      sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for Captain Zelotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him alone, then,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to be a decent man.
      What do you want to do? Tell on him and have him chucked overboard from
      one church after another until he gets discouraged and takes to swindlin&rsquo; 
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rachel Ellis could not see it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he was a saved sinner,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;and repentant of his sins, then
      he&rsquo;d ought to repent &lsquo;em out loud. Hidin&rsquo; &lsquo;em ain&rsquo;t repentin&rsquo;. And,
      besides, there&rsquo;s Donald&rsquo;s (Donald was the hero&rsquo;s name) there&rsquo;s Donald&rsquo;s
      duty to the man that&rsquo;s been so good to him. Is it fair to that man to keep
      still and let him hire a minister that, like as not, will steal the
      collection, box and all, afore he gets through? No, sir, Donald ought to
      tell THAT man, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olive was pretty dubious about the whole scheme. She doubted if anybody
      connected with a circus COULD ever become a minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;trade is so different,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kendall was not there that evening, his attendance being required at a
      meeting of the Sunday School teachers. Helen, however, was not at that
      meeting and Captain Zelotes declared his intention of asking her opinion
      by telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll say same as I do&mdash;you see if she don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he declared. When he
      called the parsonage, however, Maria Price answered the phone and informed
      him that Helen was spending the evening with old Mrs. Crowell, who lived
      but a little way from the Snow place. The captain promptly called up the
      Crowell house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s there and she&rsquo;ll stop in here on her way along,&rdquo; he said
      triumphantly. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;ll back me up&mdash;you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not. She did not &ldquo;back up&rdquo; any one. She merely smiled and
      declared the problem too complicated to answer offhand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Albert?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;After all, he is the one who
      must settle it eventually.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said Olive. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s real provokin&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t he? And now you
      won&rsquo;t tell, either, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet. But I think he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert, as usual, walked home with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to answer your hero&rsquo;s riddle?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I tell you, suppose you tell me what your answer would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reflected. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it seems to me that, all things being as
      they are, he should do this: He should go to the sideshow man&mdash;the
      minister now&mdash;and have a very frank talk with him. He should tell him
      that he had decided to say nothing about the old life and to help him in
      every way, to be his friend&mdash;provided that he keep straight, that is
      all. Of course more than that would be meant, the alternative would be
      there and understood, but he need not say it. I think that course of
      action would be fair to himself and to everybody. That is my answer. What
      is yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed quietly. &ldquo;Just that, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You would see it, I
      knew. You always see down to the heart of things, Helen. You have the
      gift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t really need a gift, this particular
      problem, did it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is not&mdash;excuse me&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t
      exactly a new one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. It is as old as the hills, but there are always new twists
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As there are to all our old problems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. By the way, your advice about the ending of my third story was
      exactly what I needed. The editor wrote me he should never have forgiven
      me if it had ended in any other way. It probably WOULD have ended in
      another way if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you. Thank you, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know there was really nothing to thank me for. It was all you, as
      usual. Have you planned the next story, the fifth, yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not entirely. I have some vague ideas. Do you want to hear them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they discussed those ideas as they walked along the sidewalk of the
      street leading down to the parsonage. It was a warm evening, a light mist,
      which was not substantial enough to be a fog, hanging low over everything,
      wrapping them and the trees and the little front yards and low houses of
      the old village in a sort of cozy, velvety, confidential quiet. The scent
      of lilacs was heavy in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both were silent. Just when they had ceased speaking neither could
      have told. They walked on arm in arm and suddenly Albert became aware that
      this silence was dangerous for him; that in it all his resolves and brave
      determinations were melting into mist like that about him; that he must
      talk and talk at once and upon a subject which was not personal, which&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Helen spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what this reminds me of?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All this talk of ours?
      It reminds me of how we used to talk over those first poems of yours. You
      have gone a long way since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have gone to Kaiserville and back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean. I mean your work has improved wonderfully. You
      write with a sure hand now, it seems to me. And your view is so much
      broader.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not the narrow, conceited little rooster I used to be. I told
      you, Helen, that the war handed me an awful jolt. Well, it did. I think
      it, or my sickness or the whole business together, knocked most of that
      self-confidence of mine galley-west. For so much I&rsquo;m thankful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I am, altogether. I don&rsquo;t want you to lose confidence
      in yourself. You should be confident now because you deserve to be. And
      you write with confidence, or it reads as if you did. Don&rsquo;t you feel that
      you do, yourself? Truly, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps, a little. I have been at it for some time now. I ought to
      show some progress. Perhaps I don&rsquo;t make as many mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see that you have made any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made one . . . a damnable one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. I didn&rsquo;t mean to say that. . . . Helen, do you know it is
      awfully good of you to take all this interest in me&mdash;in my work, I
      mean. Why do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because&mdash;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? Haven&rsquo;t we always talked about your
      writings together, almost since we first knew each other? Aren&rsquo;t we old
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it was again&mdash;friends. It was like a splash of cold water in
      the face, at once awakening and chilling. Albert walked on in silence for
      a few moments and then began speaking of some trivial subject entirely
      disconnected with himself or his work or her. When they reached the
      parsonage door he said good night at once and strode off toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his room, however, he gave himself another mental picking to
      pieces. He was realizing most distinctly that this sort of thing would not
      do. It was easy to say that his attitude toward Helen Kendall was to be
      that of a friend and nothing more, but it was growing harder and harder to
      maintain that attitude. He had come within a breath that very night of
      saying what was in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if he had said it, if he did say it&mdash;what then? After all, was
      there any real reason why he should not say it? It was true that he had
      loved, or fancied that he loved, Madeline, that he had been betrothed to
      her&mdash;but again, what of it? Broken engagements were common enough,
      and there was nothing disgraceful in this one. Why not go to Helen and
      tell her that his fancied love for Madeline had been the damnable mistake
      he had confessed making. Why not tell her that since the moment when he
      saw her standing in the doorway of the parsonage on the morning following
      his return from New York he had known that she was the only woman in the
      world for him, that it was her image he had seen in his dreams, in the
      delirium of fever, that it was she, and not that other, who&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But there, all this was foolishness, and he knew it. He did not dare say
      it. Not for one instant had she, by speech or look or action, given him
      the slightest encouragement to think her feeling for him was anything but
      friendship. And that friendship was far too precious to risk. He must not
      risk it. He must keep still, he must hide his thoughts, she must never
      guess. Some day, perhaps, after a year or two, after his position in his
      profession was more assured, then he might speak. But even then there
      would be that risk. And the idea of waiting was not pleasant. What had
      Rachel told him concerning the hosts of doctors and officers and generals
      who had been &ldquo;shining up&rdquo; to her. Some risk there, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, never mind. He would try to keep on as he had been going for the
      present. He would try not to see her as frequently. If the strain became
      unbearable he might go away somewhere&mdash;for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go away, but he made it a point not to see her as frequently.
      However, they met often even as it was. And he was conscious always that
      the ice beneath his feet was very, very thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wonderful August evening he was in his room upstairs. He was not
      writing. He had come up there early because he wished to think, to
      consider. A proposition had been made to him that afternoon, a surprising
      proposition&mdash;to him it had come as a complete surprise&mdash;and
      before mentioning it even to his grandparents he wished to think it over
      very carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock his grandfather called to him from the foot of the
      stairs and asked him to come down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kendall&rsquo;s on the phone,&rdquo; said Captain Zelotes. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s worried about
      Helen. She&rsquo;s up to West Harniss sittin&rsquo; up along of Lurany Howes, who&rsquo;s
      been sick so long. She ain&rsquo;t come home, and the old gentleman&rsquo;s frettin&rsquo; 
      about her walkin&rsquo; down from there alone so late. I told him I cal&rsquo;lated
      you&rsquo;d just as soon harness Jess and drive up and get her. You talk with
      him yourself, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert did and, after assuring the nervous clergyman that he would see
      that his daughter reached home safely, put on his hat and went out to the
      barn. Jessamine was asleep in her stall. As he was about to lead her out
      he suddenly remembered that one of the traces had broken that morning and
      Captain Zelotes had left it at the harness-maker&rsquo;s to be mended. It was
      there yet. The captain had forgotten the fact, and so had he. That settled
      the idea of using Jessamine and the buggy. Never mind, it was a beautiful
      night and the walk was but little over a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the tiny story-and-a-half Howes cottage, sitting back from
      the road upon the knoll amid the tangle of silverleaf sprouts, it was
      Helen herself who opened the door. She was surprised to see him, and when
      he explained his errand she was a little vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of Father&rsquo;s worrying,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Such a wonderful night as
      this, bright moonlight, and in South Harniss, too. Nothing ever happens to
      people in South Harniss. I will be ready in a minute or two. Mrs. Howes&rsquo; 
      niece is here now and will stay with her until to-morrow. Then her sister
      is coming to stay a month. As soon as I get her medicine ready we can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the tiny bedroom adjoining the sitting room was open, and
      Albert, sitting upon the lounge with the faded likeness of a pink dog
      printed on the plush cover, could hear the querulous voice of the invalid
      within. The widow Howes was deaf and, as Laban Keeler described it,
      &ldquo;always hollered loud enough to make herself hear&rdquo; when she spoke. Helen
      was moving quietly about the sick room and speaking in a low tone. Albert
      could not hear what she said, but he could hear Lurania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a wonder, that&rsquo;s what you be,&rdquo; declared the latter, &ldquo;and I told
      your pa so last time he was here. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a saint,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;if ever there
      was one on this earth. She&rsquo;s the nicest, smartest, best-lookin&rsquo; girl in
      THIS town and . . .&rsquo; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had been a murmur, presumably of remonstrance, from Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EH? WHO&rsquo;D you say was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A third murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHO? . . . Oh, that Speranzy one? Lote Snow&rsquo;s grandson? The one they used
      to call the Portygee? . . . Eh? Well, all right, I don&rsquo;t care if he did
      hear me. If he don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re nice and smart and good-lookin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s
      high time he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen, a trifle embarrassed but laughing, emerged a moment later, and when
      she had put on her hat she and Albert left the Howes cottage and began
      their walk home. It was one of those nights such as Cape Codders,
      year-rounders or visitors, experience three or four times during a summer
      and boast of the remainder of the year. A sky clear, deep, stretched
      cloudless from horizon to horizon. Every light at sea or on shore, in
      cottage window or at masthead or in lighthouse or on lightship a twinkling
      diamond point. A moon, apparently as big as a barrel-head, hung up in the
      east and below it a carpet of cold fire, of dancing, spangled silver
      spread upon the ocean. The sound of the surf, distant, soothing; and for
      the rest quiet and the fragrance of the summer woods and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked rather fast at first and the conversation was brisk, but as
      the night began to work its spell upon them their progress was slower and
      there were intervals of silence of which neither was aware. They came to
      the little hill where the narrow road from West Harniss comes to join the
      broader highway leading to the Center. There were trees here, a pine
      grove, on the landward side, and toward the sea nothing to break the
      glorious view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen caught her breath. &ldquo;Oh, it is beautiful, beautiful!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert did not answer. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What are you
      thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not tell her what he was thinking about. Instead, having caught
      himself just in time, he began telling her of what he had been thinking
      when his grandfather called him to the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to ask your advice. I had an astonishing
      proposal made to me this afternoon. I must make a decision, I must say yes
      or no, and I&rsquo;m not sure which to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;Doctor Parker called me into his office.
      There was a group of men there, prominent men in politics from about the
      country; Judge Baxter from Ostable was there, and Captain Warren from
      South Denboro, and others like them. What do you suppose they want me to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They offer me the party nomination for Congress from this section. That
      is, of course, they want me to permit my name to stand and they seem sure
      my nomination will be confirmed by the voters. The nomination, they say,
      is equivalent to election. They seem certain of it. . . . And they were
      insistent that I accept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, Albert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They said a good many flattering things, things I should like to
      believe. They said my war record and my writing and all that had made me a
      prominent man in the county&mdash;Please don&rsquo;t think I take any stock in
      that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> do. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is all. They seemed confident that I would make a good
      congressman. I am not so sure. Of course the thing . . . well, it does
      tempt me, I confess. I could keep on with my writing, of course. I should
      have to leave the home people for a part of the year, but I could be with
      them or near them the rest. And . . . well, Helen, I&mdash;I think I
      should like the job. Just now, when America needs Americans and the thing
      that isn&rsquo;t American must be fought, I should like&mdash;if I were sure I
      was capable of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are&mdash;you ARE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so? Would you like to have me try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt her arm tremble upon his. She drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should be so PROUD!&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a quiver in her voice, almost a sob. He bent toward her. She was
      looking off toward the sea, the moonlight upon her face was like a glory,
      her eyes were shining&mdash;and there were tears in them. His heart
      throbbed wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Helen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and looked up into his face. The next moment her own face was
      hidden against his breast, his arms were about her, and . . . and the
      risk, the risk he had feared to take, was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked home after a time, but it was a slow, a very slow walk with
      many interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Helen,&rdquo; he kept saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can. How can you? In
      spite of it all. I&mdash;I treated you so badly. I was SUCH an idiot. And
      you really care? You really do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed happily. &ldquo;I really do . . . and . . . and I really have, all
      the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, by George! And . . . Helen, do you know I think&mdash;I
      think I did too&mdash;always&mdash;only I was such a young fool I didn&rsquo;t
      realize it. WHAT a young fool I was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, dear, don&rsquo;t. . . . You are going to be a great man. You
      are a famous one already; you are going to be great. Don&rsquo;t you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall have to be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I am going to be worthy of
      you.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Albert, sitting in the private office of Z. Snow and Co., dropped his
      newspaper and looked up with a smile as his grandfather came in. Captain
      Zelotes&rsquo; florid face was redder even than usual, for it was a cloudy day
      in October and blowing a gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; puffed the captain, pulling off his overcoat and striding over to
      warm his hands at the stove; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s raw as January comin&rsquo; over the tops of
      those Trumet hills, and blowin&rsquo; hard enough to part your back hair,
      besides. One time there I didn&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;d have to reef, cal&rsquo;late I
      would if I&rsquo;d known how to reef an automobile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the car running as well as ever?&rdquo; asked Albert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you! Took all but two of those hills on full steam and never
      slowed down a mite. Think of goin&rsquo; to Trumet and back in a forenoon, and
      havin&rsquo; time enough to do the talkin&rsquo; I went to do besides. Why, Jess would
      have needed the whole day to make the down cruise, to say nothin&rsquo; of the
      return trip. Well, the old gal&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; a good rest now, nothin&rsquo; much to
      do but eat and sleep. She deserves it; she&rsquo;s been a good horse for your
      grandma and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands before the stove and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olive&rsquo;s still scared to death for fear I&rsquo;ll get run into, or run over
      somebody or somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I tell her I can navigate that car
      now the way I used to navigate the old President Hayes, and I could do
      that walkin&rsquo; in my sleep. There&rsquo;s a little exaggeration there,&rdquo; he added,
      with a grin. &ldquo;It takes about all my gumption when I&rsquo;m wide awake to turn
      the flivver around in a narrow road, but I manage to do it. . . . Well,
      what are you doin&rsquo; in here, Al?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Readin&rsquo; the Item&rsquo;s prophesy
      about how big your majority&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert smiled. &ldquo;I dropped in here to wait for you, Grandfather,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;The novel-writing mill wasn&rsquo;t working particularly well, so I
      gave it up and took a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the parsonage, I presume likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I did stop there for a minute or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! I&rsquo;m surprised to hear it. How is Helen this mornin&rsquo;? Did
      she think you&rsquo;d changed much since you saw her last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She didn&rsquo;t say so if she did. She sent her love to you and
      Grandmother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What she had left over, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And said to tell you not to tire yourself out electioneering for me. That
      was good advice, too. Grandfather, don&rsquo;t you know that you shouldn&rsquo;t motor
      all the way to Trumet and back a morning like this? I&rsquo;d rather&mdash;much
      rather go without the votes than have you do such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes seated himself in his desk chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do without &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Obed Nye&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      chairman of the Trumet committee&mdash;figgers you&rsquo;ll have a five-to-one
      majority. He told me to practice callin&rsquo; you &lsquo;the Honorable&rsquo; because
      that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be by Tuesday night of week after next. And next winter
      Mother and I will be takin&rsquo; a trip to Washin&rsquo;ton so as to set in the
      gallery and listen to you makin&rsquo; speeches. We&rsquo;ll be some consider&rsquo;ble
      proud of you, too, boy,&rdquo; he added, with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandson looked away, out of the window, over the bleak yard with its
      piles of lumber. The voice of Issacher raised in expostulation with the
      driver of Cahoon&rsquo;s &ldquo;truck-wagon&rdquo; could be faintly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hate to leave you and Grandmother and the old place,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;If I am elected&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHEN you&rsquo;re elected; there isn&rsquo;t any &lsquo;if.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right. I shall hate to leave South Harniss. Every person I
      really care for will be here. Helen&mdash;and you people at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you and Helen can&rsquo;t be married and go to Washin&rsquo;ton
      together. Not to stay permanent,&rdquo; he added quickly, &ldquo;but just while
      Congress is in session. Your grandma says then she&rsquo;d feel as if you had
      somebody to look after you. She always figgers, you know, that a man ain&rsquo;t
      capable of lookin&rsquo; out for himself. There&rsquo;d ought to be at least one woman
      to take care of him, see that he don&rsquo;t get his feet wet and goes to
      meetin&rsquo; reg&rsquo;lar and so on; if there could be two, so much the better.
      Mother would have made a pretty good Mormon, in some ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laughed. &ldquo;Helen feels she must stay with her father for the
      present,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course she is right. Perhaps by and by we can find
      some good capable housekeeper to share the responsibility, but not this
      winter. IF I am sent to Washington I shall come back often, you may be
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When ARE you cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to be married, if that ain&rsquo;t a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps next spring. Certainly next fall. It will depend upon Mr.
      Kendall&rsquo;s health. But, Grandfather, I do feel rather like a deserter,
      going off and leaving you here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! You don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;M breakin&rsquo; down, runnin&rsquo; strong to talk
      and weakenin&rsquo; everywhere else, like old Minister Kendall, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly. But . . . well, you see, I have felt a little ungrateful
      ever since I came back from the war. In a way I am sorry that I feel I
      must give myself entirely to my writing&mdash;and my political work. I
      wish I might have gone on here in this office, accepted that partnership
      you would have given me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have it yet, you know. Might take it and just keep it to fall
      back on in case that story-mill of yours busts altogether or all hands in
      Ostable County go crazy and vote the wrong ticket. Just take it and wait.
      Always well to have an anchor ready to let go, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, but that wouldn&rsquo;t be fair. I wish I MIGHT have taken it&mdash;for
      your sake. I wish for your sake I were so constituted as to be good for
      something at it. Of course I don&rsquo;t mean by that that I should be willing
      to give up my writing&mdash;but&mdash;well, you see, Grandfather, I owe
      you an awful lot in this world . . . and I know you had set your heart on
      my being your partner in Z. Snow and Co. I know you&rsquo;re disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Lote did not answer instantly. He seemed to be thinking. Then he
      opened a drawer in his desk and took out a box of cigars similar to those
      he had offered the Honorable Fletcher Fosdick on the occasion of their
      memorable interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoke, Al?&rdquo; he asked. Albert declined because of the nearness to dinner
      time, but the captain, who never permitted meals or anything else to
      interfere with his smoking, lighted one of the cigars and leaned back in
      his chair, puffing steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ll, Al,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about that. There was a time&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      own up that there was a time when the idea you wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to turn out a
      business man and the partner who would take over this concern after I got
      my clearance papers was a notion I wouldn&rsquo;t let myself think of for a
      minute. I wouldn&rsquo;t THINK of it, that&rsquo;s all. But I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about
      that, as I have about some other things.&rdquo; He paused, tugged at his beard,
      and then added, &ldquo;And I guess likely I might as well own up to the whole
      truth while I&rsquo;m about it: I didn&rsquo;t change it because I wanted to, but
      because I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;&lsquo;twas changed for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made this statement more as if he were thinking aloud than as if he
      expected a reply. A moment later he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;twas changed for me. And,&rdquo; with a shrug, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      rather prided myself that when my mind was made up it stayed that way. But&mdash;but,
      well, consarn it, I&rsquo;ve about come to the conclusion that I was a
      pig-headed old fool, Al, in some ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Grandfather. You are the last man to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean a candidate for the feeble-minded school. There ain&rsquo;t
      been any Snows put there that I can remember, not our branch of &lsquo;em,
      anyhow. But, consarn it, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he was plainly finding it hard
      to express his thought, &ldquo;I&mdash;well, I used to think I knew
      consider&rsquo;ble, had what I liked to think was good, hard sense. &lsquo;Twas hard
      enough, I cal&rsquo;late&mdash;pretty nigh petrified in spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert laid a hand on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; he replied impulsively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Then I won&rsquo;t. But, you see, Al, it bothers me. Look how I used
      to talk about makin&rsquo; up poetry and writin&rsquo; yarns and all that. Used to
      call it silliness and a waste of time, I did&mdash;worse names than that,
      generally. And look what you&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; at it in money, to say nothin&rsquo; of
      its shovin&rsquo; you into Congress, and keepin&rsquo; the newspapers busy printin&rsquo; 
      stuff about you. . . . Well, well,&rdquo; with a sigh of resignation, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand it yet, but know it&rsquo;s so, and if I&rsquo;d had my pig-headed way
      &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t have been so. It&rsquo;s a dreadful belittlin&rsquo; feelin&rsquo; to a man at my
      time of life, a man that&rsquo;s commanded ten-thousand-ton steamers and handled
      crews and bossed a business like this. It makes him wonder how many other
      fool things he&rsquo;s done. . . . Why, do you know, Al,&rdquo; he added, in a sudden
      burst of confidence, &ldquo;I was consider&rsquo;ble prejudiced against you when you
      first came here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made the statement as if he expected it to come as a stunning surprise.
      Albert would not have laughed for the world, nor in one way did he feel
      like it, but it was funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you were, a little,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean just because you was your father&rsquo;s son. I mean on your
      own account, in a way. Somehow, you see, I couldn&rsquo;t believe&mdash;eh? Oh,
      come in, Labe! It&rsquo;s all right. Al and I are just talkin&rsquo; about nothin&rsquo; in
      particular and all creation in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keeler entered with a paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to bother you, Cap&rsquo;n Lote,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this bill of Colby and
      Sons for that last lot of hardware ain&rsquo;t accordin&rsquo; to agreement. The
      prices on those butts ain&rsquo;t right, and neither&rsquo;s those half-inch screws.
      Better send it back to em, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zelotes inspected the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Labe. You generally are, I notice.
      Yes, send it back and tell &lsquo;em&mdash;anything you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laban smiled. &ldquo;I want to, all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is the third time
      they&rsquo;ve sent wrong bills inside of two months. Well, Al,&rdquo; turning toward
      him, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late this makes you kind of homesick, don&rsquo;t it, this talk
      about bills and screws and bolts and such? Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t teasin&rsquo; for your old job
      back again, was you, Al? Cal&rsquo;late he could have it, couldn&rsquo;t he, Cap&rsquo;n?
      We&rsquo;ll need somebody to heave a bucket of water on Issy pretty soon; he&rsquo;s
      gettin&rsquo; kind of pert and uppish again. Pretty much so. Yes, yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed, chuckling. Captain Zelotes looked after him. He tugged at his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you know what I&rsquo;ve about made up my mind to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve about made up my mind to take Labe Keeler into the firm of Z. Snow
      and Co. YOU won&rsquo;t come in, and,&rdquo; with a twinkle, &ldquo;I need somebody to keep
      my name from gettin&rsquo; lonesome on the sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert was delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully for you, Grandfather!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do a better
      thing for Labe or for the firm. And he deserves it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, I think he does. Labe&rsquo;s a mighty faithful, capable feller, and now
      that he&rsquo;s sworn off on those vacations of his he can be trusted anywheres.
      Yes, I&rsquo;ve as good as made up my mind to take him in. Of course,&rdquo; with the
      twinkle in evidence once more, &ldquo;Issachar&rsquo;ll be a little mite jealous, but
      we&rsquo;ll have to bear up under that as best we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Labe will say when you tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say yes. I&rsquo;ll tell Rachel first and she&rsquo;ll tell him to say it. And
      then I&rsquo;ll tell &lsquo;em both I won&rsquo;t do it unless they agree to get married.
      I&rsquo;ve always said I didn&rsquo;t want to die till I&rsquo;d been to that weddin&rsquo;. I
      want to hear Rachel tell the minister she&rsquo;ll &lsquo;obey&rsquo; Labe. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose they ever will be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I kind of think so. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they would be right
      off now if it wasn&rsquo;t that Rachel wouldn&rsquo;t think of givin&rsquo; up keepin&rsquo; house
      for your grandmother. She wouldn&rsquo;t do that and Labe wouldn&rsquo;t want her to.
      I&rsquo;ve got to fix that somehow. Perhaps they could live along with us. Land
      knows there&rsquo;s room enough. They&rsquo;re all right, those two. Kind of funny to
      look at, and they match up in size like a rubber boot and a slipper, but I
      declare I don&rsquo;t know which has got the most common-sense or the biggest
      heart. And &lsquo;twould be hard to tell which thinks the most of you, Al. . . .
      Eh? Why, it&rsquo;s after half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock! Olive&rsquo;ll be for combin&rsquo; our
      topknots with a belayin&rsquo; pin if we keep her dinner waitin&rsquo; like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they were putting on their coats the captain spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t finished what I was sayin&rsquo; to you when Labe came in,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t much account; just a sort of confession, and they say
      that&rsquo;s good for the soul. I was just goin&rsquo; to say that when you first came
      here I was prejudiced against you, not only because your father and I
      didn&rsquo;t agree, but because he was what he was. Because he was&mdash;was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert finished the sentence for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Portygee,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, that&rsquo;s what I called him. That&rsquo;s what I used to call about
      everybody that wasn&rsquo;t born right down here in Yankeeland. I used to be
      prejudiced against you because you was what I called a half-breed. I&rsquo;m
      sorry, Al. I&rsquo;m ashamed. See what you&rsquo;ve turned out to be. I declare, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shh! shh! Don&rsquo;t, Grandfather. When I came here I was a little snob, a
      conceited, insufferable little&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, here! Hold on! No, you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, neither. Or if you was, you was only
      a boy. I was a man, and I ought to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to finish. Whatever I am now, or whatever I may be. I owe
      to you, and to Grandmother, and Rachel and Laban&mdash;and Helen. You made
      me over between you. I know that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked home instead of riding in the new car. Captain Zelotes
      declared he had hung on to that steering wheel all the forenoon and he was
      afraid if he took it again his fingers would grow fast to the rim. As they
      emerged from the office into the open air, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Al, regardin&rsquo; that makin&rsquo;-over business, I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it
      was a kind of&mdash;er&mdash;mutual thing between you and me. We both had
      some prejudices to get rid of, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. I&rsquo;m sure I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sartin sure I did. And the war and all that came with it put the
      finishin&rsquo; touches to the job. When I think of what the thousands and
      thousands of men did over there in those hell-holes of trenches, men with
      names that run all the way from Jones and Kelly to&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speranza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Whiskervitch and the land knows what more. When I think of that
      I&rsquo;m ready to take off my hat to &lsquo;em and swear I&rsquo;ll never be so narrow
      again as to look down on a feller because he don&rsquo;t happen to be born in
      Ostable County. There&rsquo;s only one thing I ask of &lsquo;em, and that is that when
      they come here to live&mdash;to stay&mdash;under our laws and takin&rsquo; 
      advantage of the privileges we offer &lsquo;em&mdash;they&rsquo;ll stop bein&rsquo; 
      Portygees or Russians or Polacks or whatever they used to be or their
      folks were, and just be Americans&mdash;like you, Al.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we must work for now, Grandfather. It&rsquo;s a big job, but it
      must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence for a time. Then the captain said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty fine country, after all, ain&rsquo;t it, Albert?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert looked about him over the rolling hills, the roofs of the little
      town, the sea, the dunes, the pine groves, the scene which had grown so
      familiar to him and which had become in his eyes so precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is MY country,&rdquo; he declared, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      His grandfather caught his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you feel that way, son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t just South
      Harniss I meant then. I meant all of it, the whole United States. It&rsquo;s got
      its faults, of course, lots of &lsquo;em. And if I was an Englishman or a
      Frenchman I&rsquo;d probably say it wasn&rsquo;t as good as England or France,
      whichever it happened to be. That&rsquo;s all right; I ain&rsquo;t findin&rsquo; any fault
      with &lsquo;em for that&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way they&rsquo;d ought to feel. But you and
      I, Al, we&rsquo;re Americans. So the rest of the world must excuse us if we say
      that, take it by and large, it&rsquo;s a mighty good country. We&rsquo;ve planned for
      it, and worked for it, and fought for it, and we know. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And no howlin&rsquo;, wild-eyed bunch from somewhere else that haven&rsquo;t
      done any of these things are goin&rsquo; to come here and run it their way if we
      can help it&mdash;we Americans; eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alberto Miguel Carlos Speranza, American, drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! Well, unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, I smell salt fish and potatoes,
      which, accordin&rsquo; to Cape Cod notion, is a good American dinner. I don&rsquo;t
      know how you feel, Al, but I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
