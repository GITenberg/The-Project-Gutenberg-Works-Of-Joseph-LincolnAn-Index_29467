    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the twentieth day of April in the year 19&mdash;, the people&mdash;that
      is, a majority of the grown people of Ostable&mdash;were talking of
      Marcellus Hall and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of this statement is not surprising. The average person, no matter
      how humble or obscure, is pretty certain to be talked about on the day of
      his funeral, and Marcellus was to be buried that afternoon. Moreover,
      Marcellus had been neither humble nor obscure; also, he had been talked
      about a good deal during the fifty-nine years of his sojourn on this
      planet. So it is not at all surprising that he should be talked about now,
      when that sojourn was ended. But for all Ostable&mdash;yes, and a large
      part of South Harniss&mdash;to be engaged in speculation concerning the
      future of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was surprising, for, prior to Marcellus&rsquo;s death,
      very few outside of the Hall household had given her or her future a
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this day, however, whenever or wherever the name of Marcellus Hall was
      mentioned, after the disposition of Marcellus&rsquo;s own bones had been
      discussed and those of his family skeleton disinterred and articulated,
      the conversation, in at least eight cases out of ten, resolved itself into
      a guessing contest, having as its problem this query:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to become of that child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bethuel Sparrow, local newsgatherer for the Ostable Enterprise, seated
      before his desk in the editorial sanctum, was writing an obituary for next
      week&rsquo;s paper, under the following head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Prominent Citizen Passes Away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ordinary man would probably have written &ldquo;Dies&rdquo;; but Mr. Sparrow, being
      a young and very new reporter for a rural weekly, wrote &ldquo;Passes Away&rdquo; as
      more elegant and less shocking to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much more soothing and refined to pass away than to die&mdash;unless
      one happens to be the person most concerned, in which case, perhaps, it
      may make little difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Angel of Death,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Sparrow, &ldquo;passed through our midst on
      Tuesday last and called to his reward Captain Marcellus Hall, one of
      Ostable&rsquo;s most well-known and influential residents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight exaggeration here. Marcellus had lived in Ostable but five years
      altogether and, during the last three, had taken absolutely no part in
      town affairs&mdash;political, religious or social. However, &ldquo;influential&rdquo;
       is a good word and usual in obituaries, so Bethuel let it stand. He
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hall&rsquo;s sudden death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erasure of &ldquo;death&rdquo; and substitution of &ldquo;demise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;Was a shock to the community at large. It happened on account of&mdash;&rdquo;
       More erasures and substitutions. &ldquo;&mdash;It was the result of his taking
      cold owing to exposure during the heavy southeast rains of week before
      last which developed into pneumonia. He grew rapidly worse and passed away
      at 3.06 P.M. on Tuesday, leaving a vacancy in our midst which will be hard
      to fill, if at all. Although Captain Hall had resided in Ostable but a
      comparatively short period, he was well-known and respected, both as a man
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, invention failing, Mr. Sparrow called for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Perce,&rdquo; he hailed, addressing his companion, Mr. Percy Clark, who
      was busy setting type: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a good word to use here? I say Marcellus
      was respected both as a man&mdash;and somethin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; queried Percy, absently, scanning the eight point case. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you what would be a good thing to go with &lsquo;man&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? I don&rsquo;t know. Woman, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, cut it out. Never mind, I got it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;As a man and a citizen. Captain Hall was fifty-nine years of age
      at the time of his demise. He was born in South Harniss and followed the
      sea until 1871, when he founded the firm of Hall and Company, which was
      for some years the leading dealer in fresh and salt fish in this section
      of the state. When the firm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Perce! &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t do to say Marcellus failed in business, would
      it? Might seem like hintin&rsquo; at that stuff about his sister and the rest of
      it. Might get us into trouble, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I don&rsquo;t know who with. Everybody&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about it, anyway. Up to
      the boardin&rsquo; house they&rsquo;ve been talking about mighty little else ever
      since he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but talk&rsquo;s one thing and print&rsquo;s another. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to leave it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the firm went out of business in 1879, Captain Hall followed the sea
      again, commanding the ships Faraway, Fair Wind, and Treasure Seeker, and
      the bark Apollo. Later he retired from the sea and has not been active in
      the same or otherwise since. In 1894 he married Augusta Bangs Lathrop,
      widow of the late Reverend Charles Lathrop, formerly pastor of the
      Congregational Church in this town. Captain Hall had been residing in his
      native town, South Harniss, but after his marriage he took up his
      residence in Ostable, purchasing the residence formerly owned by Elnathan
      Phinney on Phinney&rsquo;s Hill, where he lived until his lamented demise. Mrs.
      Hall passed away in 1896. The sudden removal of Captain Hall from our
      midst leaves a stepdaughter, Mary Augusta Lathrop, aged seven. The&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Sparrow&rsquo;s train of thought collided with the obstruction which
      was derailing many similar trains in Ostable and South Harniss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Perce,&rdquo; he observed &ldquo;what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to become of that kid of
      Marcellus&rsquo;s&mdash;his wife&rsquo;s, I mean? Marcellus didn&rsquo;t have any relations,
      as far as anybody knows, and neither did his wife. Who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to take
      care of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Percy shook his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what all hands
      are askin&rsquo;. I presume likely she&rsquo;ll be looked after. Marcellus left plenty
      of money, didn&rsquo;t he? And kids with money can generally find guardians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup, I guess that&rsquo;s so. Still, whoever gets her will have their hands
      full. She&rsquo;s the most old-fashioned, queerest young-one ever I saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So much for Mr. Sparrow and his fellow laborer for the Enterprise. Now to
      listen for a moment to Judge Baxter, who led the legal profession of
      Ostable; and to Mrs. Baxter who, so common report affirmed, led the Judge.
      The pair were upstairs in the Baxter house, dressing for the funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Baxter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the queerest thing I ever heard of.
      You say they don&rsquo;t know&mdash;either of them&mdash;and the child herself
      doesn&rsquo;t know, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Ophelia. No one knows except myself. Captain Hall read the
      letter to me and put it in my charge a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, I said it at the time, and I&rsquo;ve been saying it to myself
      ever since. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything; that is, it is not binding legally,
      of course. It&rsquo;s absolutely unbusinesslike and unpractical. Simply a
      letter, asking them, as old friends, to do this thing. Whether they will
      or not the Almighty only knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Daniel, I must say I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you, as his lawyer,
      would have let him do such a thing. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know either of them
      very well, but, from what little I&rsquo;ve heard, I should say they know as
      much about what they would be supposed to do as&mdash;as you do about
      tying a necktie. For mercy sakes let me fix it! The knot is supposed to be
      under your chin, not under your ear as if you were going to be hung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge meekly elevated the chin and his wife pulled the tie into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they can say yes or no just as they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it rests entirely with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose they say no, what will become of the child then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. Captain Hall seemed pretty certain they wouldn&rsquo;t say
      no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! There! Now you look a little more presentable. Have you got a
      clean handkerchief? Well, that&rsquo;s an unexpected miracle; I don&rsquo;t know how
      you happened to think of it. When are you going to speak with them about
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Today, if they come to the funeral, as I suppose they will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in a fidget until I know whether they say yes or no. And
      whichever they say I shall keep on fidgeting until I see what happens
      after that. Poor little Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! I wonder what WILL become of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the road between South Harniss and Ostable a buggy drawn by an aged
      white horse was moving slowly. On the buggy&rsquo;s seat were two men, Captain
      Shadrach Gould and Zoeth Hamilton. Captain Gould, big, stout, and bearded,
      was driving. Mr. Hamilton, small, thin, smooth-faced and white-haired, was
      beside him. Both were obviously dressed in their Sunday clothes, Captain
      Shadrach&rsquo;s blue, Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s black. Each wore an uncomfortably high
      collar and the shoes of each had been laboriously polished. Their faces,
      utterly unlike in most respects, were very solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah hum!&rdquo; sighed Mr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach snorted impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land sakes don&rsquo;t do that again, Zoeth,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
      tenth &lsquo;Ah hum&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve cast loose in a mile. I know we&rsquo;re bound to a
      funeral but there ain&rsquo;t no need of tollin&rsquo; the bell all the way. I don&rsquo;t
      like it and I don&rsquo;t think Marcellus would neither, if he could hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he can hear us, Shadrach,&rdquo; suggested his companion, mildly.
      &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s here with us now; who can tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, if he is then I KNOW he don&rsquo;t like it. Marcellus never made
      any fuss whatever happened, and he wouldn&rsquo;t make any at his own funeral no
      more than at anybody else&rsquo;s. That wasn&rsquo;t his way. Say nothin&rsquo; and keep her
      on the course, that was Marcellus. I swan I can hardly make it seem
      possible that he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither can I, Shadrach. And to think that you and me, his old partners
      and lifelong chums as you might say, hadn&rsquo;t seen nor spoken to him for
      over two years. It makes me feel bad. Bad and sort of conscience-struck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; so it does me, in a way. And yet it wasn&rsquo;t our fault, Zoeth. You
      know as well as I do that Marcellus didn&rsquo;t want to see us. We was over to
      see him last and he scarcely said a word while we was there. You and me
      did all the talkin&rsquo; and he just set and looked at us&mdash;when he wasn&rsquo;t
      lookin&rsquo; at the floor. I never saw such a change in a man. We asked&mdash;yes,
      by fire, we fairly begged him to come and stay with us for a spell, but he
      never did. Now it ain&rsquo;t no further from Ostable to South Harniss than it
      is from South Harniss to Ostable. If he&rsquo;d wanted to come he could; if he&rsquo;d
      wanted to see us he could. We went to see him, didn&rsquo;t we; and WE had a
      store and a business to leave. He ain&rsquo;t had any business since he give up
      goin&rsquo; to sea. He&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! Shh!&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Hamilton, mildly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk that way,
      Shadrach. Don&rsquo;t find fault with the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find fault! I ain&rsquo;t findin&rsquo; fault. I thought as much of Marcellus Hall as
      any man on earth, and nobody feels worse about his bein&rsquo; took than I do.
      But I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; what we both know&rsquo;s a fact. He didn&rsquo;t want to see us;
      he didn&rsquo;t want to see nobody. Since his wife died he lived alone in that
      house, except for a housekeeper and that stepchild, and never went
      anywhere or had anybody come to see him if he could help it. A reg&rsquo;lar
      hermit&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he was, a hermit, like Peleg Myrick down to
      Setuckit P&rsquo;int. And when I think what he used to be, smart, lively, able,
      one of the best skippers and smartest business men afloat or ashore, it
      don&rsquo;t seem possible a body could change so. &lsquo;Twas that woman that done it,
      that woman that trapped him into gettin&rsquo; married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! Shh! Shadrach; she&rsquo;s dead, too. And, besides, I guess she was a
      real good woman; everybody said she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; she wasn&rsquo;t, am I? What I say is she hadn&rsquo;t no business
      marryin&rsquo; a man twenty years older&rsquo;n she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; mildly, &ldquo;you said she trapped him. Now we don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth Hamilton, you know she must have trapped him. You and I agreed that
      was just what she done. If she hadn&rsquo;t trapped him&mdash;set a reg&rsquo;lar
      seine for him and hauled him aboard like a school of mackerel&mdash;&lsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      likely he&rsquo;d have married her or anybody else, is it? I ain&rsquo;t married
      nobody, have I? And Marcellus was years older&rsquo;n I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Shadrach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t well; it&rsquo;s bad. He&rsquo;s gone, and&mdash;and you and me that was
      with him for years and years, his very best friends on earth as you might
      say, wasn&rsquo;t with him when he died. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for her he&rsquo;d have
      stayed in South Harniss where he belonged. Consarn women! They&rsquo;re
      responsible for more cussedness than the smallpox. &lsquo;When a man marries his
      trouble begins&rsquo;; that&rsquo;s gospel, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gould, after a sidelong glance at his companion, took a hand from
      the reins and laid it on the Hamilton knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Zoeth,&rdquo; he said, contritely; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to&mdash;to rake
      up bygones; I was blowin&rsquo; off steam, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Shadrach. It&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t all right; it&rsquo;s all wrong. Somebody ought to keep a watch on
      me, and when they see me beginnin&rsquo; to get hot, set me on the back of the
      stove or somewheres; I&rsquo;m always liable to bile over and scald the wrong
      critter. I&rsquo;ve done that all my life. I&rsquo;m sorry, Zoeth, you know I didn&rsquo;t
      mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know. Ah hum! Poor Marcellus! Here&rsquo;s the first break in the old
      firm, Shadrach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. You and me are all that&rsquo;s left of Hall and Company. That is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short just in time and roared a &ldquo;Git dap&rdquo; at the horse. He had
      been on the point of saying something which would have been far more
      disastrous than his reference to the troubles following marriage. Zoeth
      was apparently not curious. To his friend&rsquo;s great relief he did not wait
      for the sentence to be finished, nor did he ask embarrassing questions.
      Instead he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to become of that child, Mary Lathrop&rsquo;s girl. Who
      do you suppose likely will take charge of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve been wonderin&rsquo; that myself, Zoeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of a cute little thing, she was, too, as I recollect her. I presume
      likely she&rsquo;s grown up consid&rsquo;ble since. You remember how she set and
      looked at us that last time we was over to see Marcellus, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember? How she looked at ME, you mean! Shall I ever forget it? I&rsquo;d
      just had my hair cut by that new barber, Sim Ellis, that lived here &lsquo;long
      about then, and I told him to cut off the ends. He thought I meant the
      other ends, I cal&rsquo;late, for I went to sleep in the chair, same as I
      generally do, and when I woke up my head looked like the main truck of the
      old Faraway. All it needed was to have the bald place gilded. I give you
      my word that if I hadn&rsquo;t been born with my ears set wing and wing like a
      schooner runnin&rsquo; afore the wind I&rsquo;d have been smothered when I put my hat
      on&mdash;nothin&rsquo; but them ears kept it propped up off my nose. YOU
      remember that haircut, Zoeth. Well, all the time you and me was in
      Marcellus&rsquo;s settin&rsquo;-room that stepchild of his just set and looked at my
      head. Never took her eyes off it. If she&rsquo;d said anything &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t have
      been so bad; but she didn&rsquo;t&mdash;just looked. I could feel my bald spot
      reddenin&rsquo; up till I swan to man I thought it must be breakin&rsquo; out in
      blisters. &lsquo;Never see anybody that looked just like me, did you, Sis?&rsquo; I
      says to her, when I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; she says,
      solemn as an owl. She was right out and honest, I&rsquo;ll say that for her.
      That&rsquo;s the only time Marcellus laughed while we was inside that house. I
      didn&rsquo;t blame him much. Ho, ho! Well, he ain&rsquo;t laughin&rsquo; now and neither are
      we&mdash;or we hadn&rsquo;t ought to be. Neither is the child, I cal&rsquo;late, poor
      thing. I wonder what will become of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile the child herself was vaguely, and in childish fashion,
      wondering that very thing. She was in the carriage room of the barn
      belonging to the Hall estate&mdash;if the few acres of land and the
      buildings owned by the late Marcellus may be called an estate&mdash;curled
      up on the back seat of the old surrey which had been used so little since
      the death of her mother, Augusta Hall, four years before. The surrey was
      shrouded from top to floor with a dust cover of unbleached muslin through
      which the sunshine from the carriage room windows filtered in a
      mysterious, softened twilight. The covered surrey was a favorite retreat
      of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s. She had discovered it herself&mdash;which made it doubly
      alluring, of course&mdash;and she seldom invited her juvenile friends to
      share its curtained privacy with her. It was her playhouse, her tent, and
      her enchanted castle, much too sacred to be made common property. Here she
      came on rainy Saturdays and on many days not rainy when other children,
      those possessing brothers or sisters, played out of doors. She liked to
      play by herself, to invent plays all her own, and these other children&mdash;&ldquo;normal
      children,&rdquo; their parents called them&mdash;were much too likely to laugh
      instead of solemnly making believe as she did. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was not a
      normal child; she was &ldquo;that queer Lathrop young-one&rdquo;&mdash;had heard
      herself so described more than once. She did not like the phrase; &ldquo;queer&rdquo;
       was not so bad&mdash;perhaps she was queer&mdash;but she had an
      instinctive repugnance to being called a young-one. Birds and rabbits had
      young-ones and she was neither feathered nor furred.
    </p>
    <p>
      So very few of the neighborhood children were invited to the shaded
      interior of the old surrey. Her dolls&mdash;all five of them&mdash;spent a
      good deal of time there and David, the tortoise-shell cat, came often,
      usually under compulsion. When David had kittens, which interesting
      domestic event took place pretty frequently, he&mdash;or she&mdash;positively
      refused to be an occupant of that surrey, growling and scratching in a
      decidedly ungentlemanly&mdash;or unladylike&mdash;manner. Twice
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had attempted to make David more complacent by bringing the
      kittens also to the surrey, but their parent had promptly and
      consecutively seized them by the scruff of their necks and laboriously
      lugged them up to the haymow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, however, there being no kittens, David was slumbering in a furry
      heap beside Mary-&rsquo;Gusta at one end of the carriage seat, and Rosette, the
      smallest of the five dolls, and Rose, the largest, were sitting bolt
      upright in the corner at the other end. The christening of the smallest
      and newest doll was the result of a piece of characteristic reasoning on
      its owner&rsquo;s part. She was very fond of the name Rose, the same being the
      name of the heroine in &ldquo;Eight Cousins,&rdquo; which story Mrs. Bailey,
      housekeeper before last for Marcellus Hall, had read aloud to the child.
      When the new doll came, at Christmas time, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta wished that she
      might christen it Rose also. But there was another and much beloved Rose
      already in the family. So Mary-&rsquo;Gusta reflected and observed, and she
      observed that a big roll of tobacco such as her stepfather smoked was a
      cigar; while a little one, as smoked by Eben Keeler, the grocer&rsquo;s delivery
      clerk, was a cigarette. Therefore, the big doll being already Rose, the
      little one became Rosette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was not playing with Rose and Rosette at the present time.
      Neither was she interested in the peaceful slumbers of David. She was not
      playing at all, but sitting, with feet crossed beneath her on the seat and
      hands clasped about one knee, thinking. And, although she was thinking of
      her stepfather who she knew had gone away to a vague place called Heaven&mdash;a
      place variously described by Mrs. Bailey, the former housekeeper, and by
      Mrs. Susan Hobbs, the present one, and by Mr. Howes, the Sunday school
      superintendent&mdash;she was thinking most of herself, Mary Augusta
      Lathrop, who was going to a funeral that very afternoon and, after that,
      no one seemed to know exactly where.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful April day and the doors of the carriage house and the
      big door of the barn were wide open. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could hear the hens
      clucking and the voices of people talking. The voices were two: one was
      that of Mrs. Hobbs, the housekeeper, and the other belonged to Mr. Abner
      Hallett, the undertaker. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not like Mr. Hallett&rsquo;s voice; she
      liked neither it nor its owner&rsquo;s manner; she described both voice and
      manner to herself as &ldquo;too soothy.&rdquo; They gave her the shivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallett&rsquo;s tone was subdued at the present time, but a trifle of the
      professional &ldquo;soothiness&rdquo; was lacking. He and Mrs. Hobbs were conversing
      briskly enough and, although Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could catch only a word or two at
      intervals, she was perfectly sure they were talking about her. She was
      certain that if she were to appear at that moment in the door of the barn
      they would stop talking immediately and look at her. Everybody whom she
      had met during the past two days looked at her in that queer way. It made
      her feel as if she had something catching, like the measles, and as if,
      somehow or other, she was to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      She realized dimly that she should feel very, very badly because her
      stepfather was dead. Mrs. Hobbs had told her that she should and seemed to
      regard her as queerer than ever because she had not cried. But, according
      to the housekeeper, Captain Hall was out of his troubles and had gone
      where he would be happy for ever and ever. So it seemed to her strange to
      be expected to cry on his account. He had not been happy here in Ostable,
      or, at least, he had not shown his happiness in the way other people
      showed theirs. To her he had been a big, bearded giant of a man, whom she
      saw at infrequent intervals during the day and always at night just before
      she went to bed. His room, with the old-fashioned secretary against the
      wall, and the stuffed gull on the shelf, and the books in the cupboard,
      and the polished narwhal horn in the corner, was to her a sort of holy of
      holies, a place where she was led each evening at nine o&rsquo;clock, at first
      by Mrs. Bailey and, later, by Mrs. Hobbs, to shake the hand of the big man
      who looked at her absently over his spectacles and said good night in a
      voice not unkindly but expressing no particular interest. At other times
      she was strictly forbidden to enter that room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, but very rarely, she had eaten Sunday dinner with Marcellus.
      She and the housekeeper usually ate together and Mr. Hall&rsquo;s meals were
      served in what the child called &ldquo;the smoke room,&rdquo; meaning the apartment
      just described, which was at all times strongly scented with tobacco. The
      Sunday dinners were stately and formal affairs and were prefaced by
      lectures by the housekeeper concerning sitting up straight and not
      disturbing Cap&rsquo;n Hall by talking too much. On the whole Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was
      rather glad when the meals were over. She did not dislike her stepfather;
      he had never been rough or unkind, but she had always stood in awe of him
      and had felt that he regarded her as a &ldquo;pesky nuisance,&rdquo; something to be
      fed and then shooed out of the way, as Mrs. Hobbs regarded David, the cat.
      As for loving him, as other children seemed to love their fathers; that
      the girl never did. She was sure he did not love her in that way, and that
      he would not have welcomed demonstrations of affection on her part. She
      had learned the reason, or she thought she had: she was a STEPCHILD; that
      was why, and a stepchild was almost as bad as a &ldquo;changeling&rdquo; in a fairy
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother she remembered dimly and with that recollection were memories
      of days when she was loved and made much of, not only by Mother, but by
      Captain Hall also. She asked Mrs. Bailey, whom she had loved and whose
      leaving was the greatest grief of her life, some questions about these
      memories. Mrs. Bailey had hugged her and had talked a good deal about
      Captain Hall&rsquo;s being a changed man since his wife&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;He used to be
      so different, jolly and good-natured and sociable; you wouldn&rsquo;t know him
      now if you seen him then. When your mamma was took it just seemed to wilt
      him right down. He was awful sick himself for a spell, and when he got
      better he was like he is today. Seems as if HE died too, as you might say,
      and ain&rsquo;t really lived since. I&rsquo;m awful sorry for Cap&rsquo;n Marcellus. You
      must be real good to him when you grow up, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now he had gone before she had had a chance to grow up, and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta felt an unreasonable sense of blame. But real grief, the
      dreadful paralyzing realization of loss which an adult feels when a dear
      one dies, she did not feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was awed and a little frightened, but she did not feel like crying.
      Why should she?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Where be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Hobbs calling. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hurriedly untwisted her legs and
      scrambled from beneath the dust cover of the surrey. David, whose slumbers
      were disturbed, rose also, yawned and stretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I be, Mrs. Hobbs,&rdquo; answered the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs was standing in the doorway of the barn. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta noticed
      that she was not, as usual, garbed in gingham, but was arrayed in her best
      go-to-meeting gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comin&rsquo;, yes. But where on earth have you been? I&rsquo;ve been hunting all over
      creation for you. I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d be out here, on this day of all
      others, with&mdash;with that critter,&rdquo; indicating David, who appeared,
      blinking sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say I shouldn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be fussin&rsquo; along with a cat today,&rdquo;
       declared Mrs. Hobbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. David yawned, apparently expressing a bored
      contempt for housekeepers in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right along into the house,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Hobbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s high time
      you was gettin&rsquo; ready for the funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready? How?&rdquo; queried Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, changin&rsquo; your clothes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do folks dress up for funerals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course they do. What a question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never had one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I&rsquo;ve never been to any. What do they dress up for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, because they do, of course. Now don&rsquo;t ask any more
      questions, but hurry up. Where are you goin&rsquo; now, for mercy sakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; back after Rose and Rosette. They ought to be dressed up,
      too, hadn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea! Playin&rsquo; dolls today! I declare I never see such a child! You&rsquo;re
      a reg&rsquo;lar little&mdash;little heathen. Would you want anybody playin&rsquo; 
      dolls at your own funeral, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta thought this over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, after
      reflection. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d just as soon. Do they have dolls up in Heaven,
      Mrs. Hobbs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us! I should say not. Dolls in Heaven! The idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor cats either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t ask such wicked questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta asked no more questions of that kind, but her conviction that
      Heaven&mdash;Mrs. Hobbs&rsquo; Heaven&mdash;was a good place for housekeepers
      and grown-ups but a poor one for children was strengthened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house by the kitchen door and ascended the back stairs to
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s room. The shades in all the rooms were drawn and the house
      was dark and gloomy. The child would have asked the reason for this, but
      at the first hint of a question Mrs. Hobbs bade her hush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why mustn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t the right thing to do, that&rsquo;s why. Now hurry up and get
      dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta silently wriggled out of her everyday frock, was led to the
      washstand and vigorously scrubbed. Then Mrs. Hobbs combed and braided what
      she called her &ldquo;pigtails&rdquo; and tied a bow of black ribbon at the end of
      each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re clean for once in your life, anyhow.
      Now hurry up and put on them things on the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The things were Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s very best shoes and dress; also a pair of
      new black stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dressing was finished the housekeeper stood her in the middle of
      the floor and walked about her on a final round of inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said again, with a sigh of satisfaction. &ldquo;Nobody can say I
      ain&rsquo;t took all the pains with you that anybody could. Now you come
      downstairs and set right where I tell you till I come. And don&rsquo;t you say
      one single word. Not a word, no matter what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the girl&rsquo;s hand and led her down the front stairs. As they
      descended Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could scarcely restrain a gasp of surprise. The
      front door was open&mdash;the FRONT door&mdash;and the child had never
      seen it open before, had long ago decided that it was not a truly door at
      all, but merely a make-believe like the painted windows on the sides of
      her doll house. But now it was wide open and Mr. Hallett, arrayed in a
      suit of black, the coat of which puckered under the arms, was standing on
      the threshold, looking more soothy than ever. The parlor door was open
      also, and the parlor itself&mdash;the best first parlor, more sacred and
      forbidden even than the &ldquo;smoke room&rdquo;&mdash;was, as much of it as she could
      see, filled with chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs led her into the little room off the parlor, the &ldquo;back
      settin&rsquo;-room,&rdquo; and, indicating the haircloth and black walnut sofa against
      the wall, whispered to her to sit right there and not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind now,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk and don&rsquo;t stir. I&rsquo;ll be back by and
      by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, left alone, looked wide-eyed about the little back
      sitting-room. It, too, was changed; not changed as much as the front
      parlor, but changed, nevertheless. Most of the furniture had been removed.
      The most comfortable chairs, including the rocker with the parrot &ldquo;tidy&rdquo;
       on the back, had been taken away. One or two of the bolt-upright variety
      remained and the &ldquo;music chair&rdquo; was still there, but pushed back into a
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta saw the music chair and a quiver of guilty fear tinged along
      her spine; that particular chair had always been, to her, the bright,
      particular glory of the house. Not because it was beautiful, for that it
      distinctly was not; but because of the marvellous secret hidden beneath
      its upholstered seat. Captain Marcellus had brought it home years and
      years before, when he was a sea-going bachelor and made voyages to
      Hamburg. In its normal condition it was a perfectly quiet and ugly chair,
      but there was a catch under one arm and a music box under the seat. And if
      that catch were released, then when anyone sat in it, the music box played
      &ldquo;The Campbell&rsquo;s Are Coming&rdquo; with spirit and jingle. And, moreover, kept on
      playing it to the finish unless the catch was pushed back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mary-&rsquo;Gusta that chair was a perpetual fascination. She had been
      expressly forbidden to touch it, had been shut in the dark closet more
      than once for touching it; but, nevertheless, the temptation was always
      there and she had yielded to that temptation at intervals when Mrs. Hobbs
      and her stepfather were out. And the last time she had touched it she had
      broken the catch. She had wound up the music box, after hearing it play,
      but the catch which made it a perfectly safe seat and not a trap for the
      unwary had refused to push back into place. And now there it was, loaded
      and primed, so to speak, and she was responsible. Suppose&mdash;Oh,
      horrible thought!&mdash;suppose anyone should sit in it that afternoon!
    </p>
    <p>
      She gasped and jumped off the sofa. Then she remembered Mrs. Hobbs&rsquo; 
      parting command and stopped, hesitating. Mr. Hallett, standing at the end
      of the hall, by the front door, heard her move and tiptoed to the
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, little girl?&rdquo; he whispered, soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; gasped Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Then you set down on the sofa and keep still. You mustn&rsquo;t make
      any noise. The folks are comin&rsquo; now. Set right down on the sofy, that&rsquo;s a
      good girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So back to the sofa went Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, trembling with apprehension. From
      her seat she could see along the hall and also through the other door into
      the &ldquo;big settin&rsquo;-room,&rdquo; where, also, there were rows of chairs. And, to
      her horror, these chairs began to fill. People, most of them dressed in
      church-going garments which rattled and rustled, were tiptoeing in and
      sitting down where she could see them and they could see her. She did not
      dare to move now; did not dare go near the music chair even if going near
      it would have done any good. She remained upon the sofa, and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Mrs. Hobbs appeared, looking very solemn and
      Sundayfied, and sat beside her. Then Judge and Mrs. Baxter were shown into
      the little room and took two of the remaining chairs. The Judge bowed and
      smiled and Mrs. Baxter leaned over and patted her hand. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta tried
      to smile, too, but succeeded only in looking more miserable. Mrs. Hobbs
      whispered to her to sit up straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a steady stream of people through the front door now. They all
      entered the parlor and many stayed there, but others passed on into the
      &ldquo;big settin&rsquo;-room.&rdquo; The chairs there were almost all taken; soon all were
      taken and Mr. Hallett was obliged to remove one of those in the small
      room. There were but two left empty, one a tall, straight antique with a
      rush seat, a family heirloom, and the other the music chair. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      stared at the music chair and hoped and hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sharon, the minister, entered and shook hands with the Judge and Mrs.
      Baxter and with Mrs. Hobbs and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. He also patted the child&rsquo;s
      hand. Mrs. Hobbs whispered to him, with evident pride, that it was &ldquo;goin&rsquo; 
      to be one of the biggest funerals ever given in Ostable.&rdquo; Mr. Sharon
      nodded. Then, after waiting a moment or two, he tiptoed along the front
      hall and took up his stand by the parlor door. There was a final rustle of
      gowns, a final crackle of Sunday shirtfronts, and then a hushed silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by the rattle of wheels in the yard. Mr. Hallett at
      the door held up a warning hand. A moment later he ushered two people in
      at the front door and led them through the parlor into the &ldquo;big
      settin&rsquo;-room.&rdquo; Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could see the late comers plainly. They were
      both men, one big and red-faced and bearded, the other small, and thin,
      and white-haired. A rustle passed through the crowd and everyone turned to
      look. Some looked as if they recognized the pair, but they did not bow;
      evidently it was not proper to bow at funerals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallett, on tiptoe, of course, glided into the little room from the
      big one and looked about him. Then, to the absolute stupefaction of
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, he took the rush-seated chair in one hand and the music chair
      in the other and tiptoed out. He placed the two chairs in the back row
      close to the door of the smaller room and motioned to the two men to sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could stand it no longer. She was afraid of Mrs. Hobbs, afraid
      of Mr. Hallett, afraid of the Baxters and all the staring crowd; but she
      was more afraid of what was going to happen. She tugged at the
      housekeeper&rsquo;s sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hobbs!&rdquo; she whispered, quiveringly. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Hobbs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs shook off the clutch at her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Sshh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but please, Mrs. Hobbs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! You mustn&rsquo;t talk. Be still. Be still, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small, white-haired man sat down in the rush-seated chair. The big man
      hesitated, separated his coat tails, and then he, too, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the music box under the seat of the chair he sat in informed everyone
      with cheerful vigor that the Campbells were coming, Hurrah! Hurrah!
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach Gould arose from that chair, arose promptly and without
      hesitation. Mr. Zoeth Hamilton also rose; so did many others in the
      vicinity. There was a stir and a rustle and whispered exclamations. And
      still the news of the imminent arrival of the Campbells was tinkled abroad
      and continued to tinkle. Someone giggled, so did someone else. Others
      said, &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Judge Baxter said, &ldquo;Heavens and earth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs looked as if she wished to say something very much indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s bald spot blazed a fiery red and he glared about him
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hallett, who was used to unexpected happenings at funerals&mdash;though,
      to do him justice, he had never before had to deal with anything quite
      like this&mdash;rushed to the center of the disturbance. Mrs. Hobbs
      hastened to help. Together and with whisperings, they fidgeted with the
      refractory catch. And still the music box played&mdash;and played&mdash;and
      played.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr. Hallett gave it up. He seized the chair and with it in his
      arms rushed out into the dining-room. Captain Shadrach Gould mopped his
      face with a handkerchief and stood, because there was nowhere for him to
      sit. Mrs. Hobbs, almost as red in the face as Captain Shad himself,
      hastened back and collapsed upon the sofa. Mr. Sharon cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still, from behind the closed door of the dining-room the music chair
      tinkled on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Campbells are coming! Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; Poor little guilty, frightened
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta covered her face with her hands.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Judge Baxter, &ldquo;here we are. Sit down and make
      yourselves comfortable. I shall have a good deal to say and I expect to
      surprise you. Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gould and Mr. Hamilton were in the Judge&rsquo;s library at his home.
      The funeral was over, all that was mortal of Marcellus Hall had been laid
      to rest in the Ostable cemetery, and his two friends and former partners
      had, on their return from that cemetery, stopped at the Judge&rsquo;s, at the
      latter&rsquo;s request. He wished, so he said, to speak with them on an
      important matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down, Captain?&rdquo; asked the Judge, noticing that,
      although Zoeth had seated himself in the rocker which his host had
      indicated, Shadrach was still standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach laid a hand on the back of the armchair and regarded the
      lawyer with a very grave face, but with a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Judge,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I ever
      shall set down again quite so whole-hearted as I used to. You spoke of a
      surprise, didn&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve had one surprise this afternoon that&rsquo;s liable
      to stay with me for a spell. I&rsquo;m an unsuspectin&rsquo; critter, generally
      speakin&rsquo;, but after that&mdash;Say, you ain&rsquo;t got a brass band nor
      fireworks hitched to THIS chair, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter laughed heartily. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he could speak.
      &ldquo;No, Captain, my furniture isn&rsquo;t loaded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled, sitting down gingerly in
      the armchair. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a mercy. I ain&rsquo;t so young as I used to be and
      I couldn&rsquo;t stand many such shocks. Whew! Don&rsquo;t talk to ME! When that
      devilish jig tune started up underneath me I&rsquo;ll bet I hopped up three foot
      straight. I may be kind of slow sittin&rsquo; down, but you&rsquo;ll bear me out that
      I can GET UP sudden when it&rsquo;s necessary. And I thought the dum thing never
      would STOP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton stirred uneasily. &ldquo;Hush, hush, Shadrach!&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      be so profane. Remember you&rsquo;ve just come from the graveyard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come from it! By fire! There was a time there when I&rsquo;d have been willin&rsquo; 
      to go to it&mdash;yes, and stay. All I wanted was to get out of that room
      and hide somewheres where folks couldn&rsquo;t look at me. I give you my word I
      could feel myself heatin&rsquo; up like an airtight stove. Good thing I didn&rsquo;t
      have on a celluloid collar or &lsquo;twould have bust into a blaze. Of all the
      dummed outrages to spring on a man, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Zoeth! I&rsquo;ll calm down. But as for swearin&rsquo;&mdash;well, if
      you knew how full of cusswords I was there one spell you wouldn&rsquo;t find
      fault; you&rsquo;d thank me for holdin&rsquo; &lsquo;em in. I had to batten down my hatches
      to do it, though; I tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton turned to their host. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll excuse Shadrach, won&rsquo;t you,
      Judge,&rdquo; he said, apologetically. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; wicked, really.
      And he feels as bad as I do about Marcellus&rsquo;s bein&rsquo; took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course I do!&rdquo; put in the Captain. &ldquo;Zoeth&rsquo;s always scared to death for
      fear I&rsquo;m bound to the everlastin&rsquo; brimstone. He forgets I&rsquo;ve been to sea a
      good part of my life and that a feller has to talk strong aboard ship.
      Common language may do for keepin&rsquo; store, but it don&rsquo;t get a vessel
      nowheres; the salt sort of takes the tang out of it, seems so. I&rsquo;m through
      for the present, Zoeth. I&rsquo;ll keep the rest till I meet the swab that
      loaded up that chair for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge laughed again. Then he opened his desk and took from a drawer
      two folded papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;I asked you to come here with me because
      there is an important matter, a very important matter, which I, as Captain
      Hall&rsquo;s legal adviser, must discuss with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach and Zoeth looked at each other. The former tugged at his
      beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo; to do with Marcellus&rsquo;s affairs, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know! And somethin&rsquo; to do with me and Zoeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with both of you. This,&rdquo; holding up one of the folded papers, &ldquo;is
      Captain Hall&rsquo;s will. I drew it for him a year ago and he has appointed me
      his executor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded. &ldquo;We supposed likely he would,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get a better man,&rdquo; added Shadrach, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Captain Hall leaves all he possessed&mdash;practically all;
      there is a matter of two hundred dollars for his housekeeper, Mrs. Hobbs,
      and a few other personal gifts&mdash;but he leaves practically all he
      possessed to his stepdaughter, Mary Lathrop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both his hearers nodded again. &ldquo;We expected that, naturally,&rdquo; said the
      Captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;d ought to have done, of course. Well, she&rsquo;ll be
      pretty well fixed, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter shook his head. &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said, soberly.
      &ldquo;That is a part of the surprise which I mentioned at first. Captain Hall
      was, practically, a poor man when he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That the prophesied surprise was now a reality was manifest. Both men
      looked aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean that, Judge?&rdquo; gasped Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor? Marcellus poor?&rdquo; cried Shadrach. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, what kind of
      talk&rsquo;s that? He didn&rsquo;t have no more than the rest of us when&mdash;&rdquo; he
      hesitated, glanced at Zoeth, and continued, &ldquo;when the firm give up
      business back in &lsquo;79; but he went to sea again and made considerable, and
      then he made a whole lot in stocks. I know he did. You know it, too,
      Zoeth. How could he be poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, like so many other fortunate speculators, he continued to
      speculate and became unfortunate. He lost the bulk of his winnings in the
      stock market and&mdash;well, to be quite frank, Captain Hall has been a
      broken man, mentally as well as physically, since his wife&rsquo;s death and his
      own serious illness. You, yourselves, must have noticed the change in his
      habits. From being an active man, a man of affairs, he became almost a
      hermit. He saw but few people, dropped the society of all his old friends,
      and lived alone&mdash;alone except for his various housekeepers and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;the little girl, I mean. You must have noticed the
      change in his relations with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton sighed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we noticed he never came to see us
      and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t over&rsquo;n above sociable when we come to see him,&rdquo; finished
      Captain Shadrach. &ldquo;Yes, we noticed that. But I say, Judge, he must have
      had SOME money left. What became of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows! He was a child, so far as money matters went, in his
      later years. Very likely he frittered it away in more stock ventures; I
      know he bought a lot of good for nothing mining shares. At any rate it has
      gone, all except a few thousands. The house and land where he lived is
      mortgaged up to the handle, and I imagine there are debts, a good many of
      them. But whatever there is is left to Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;everyone calls
      her that and I seem to have caught the habit. It is left to her&mdash;in
      trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach thought this over. &ldquo;In trust with you, I presume likely,&rdquo;
       he observed. &ldquo;Well, as I said afore, he couldn&rsquo;t have found a better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE thought he could, two better men. I rather think he was right. You are
      the two, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement did not have the effect which the Judge expected. He
      expected exclamations and protests. Instead his visitors looked at each
      other and at him in a puzzled fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;what was that?&rdquo; queried Mr. Hamilton. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly
      seem to catch that, somehow or &lsquo;nother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter turned to the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understood me, didn&rsquo;t you, Captain Gould?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, no,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t seem to soak in, somehow.
      Cal&rsquo;late my head must have stopped goin&rsquo;; maybe the shock I had a spell
      ago broke the mainspring. All I seem to be real sartin of just now is that
      the Campbells are comin&rsquo;. What was it you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that Captain Marcellus Hall has left whatever property he owned,
      after his creditors are satisfied, to his stepdaughter. He has left it in
      trust until she becomes of age. And he asks you two to accept that trust
      and the care of the child. Is that plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was plain and they understood. But with understanding came, apparently,
      a species of paralysis of the vocal organs. Zoeth turned pale and leaned
      back in his chair. Shadrach&rsquo;s mouth opened and closed several times, but
      he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; went on Baxter, &ldquo;before I say any more I think you should be
      told this: It was Captain Hall&rsquo;s wish that you jointly accept the
      guardianship of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;of the girl&mdash;that she live with you
      and that you use whatever money comes to her from her stepfather&rsquo;s estate
      in educating and clothing her. Also, of course, that a certain sum each
      week be paid you from that estate as her board. That was Marcellus&rsquo;s wish;
      but it is a wish, nothing more. It is not binding upon you in any way. You
      have a perfect right to decline and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heave to!&rdquo; he ordered, breathlessly. &ldquo;Come up into the wind a minute, for
      mercy sakes! Do you mean to say that me and Zoeth are asked to take that
      young-one home with us, and take care of her, and dress her, and&mdash;and
      eat her, and bring her up and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, incoherent in his excitement. The Judge nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that is what he asks you to do. But, as I say, you are
      not obliged to do it; there is no legal obligation. You can say no, if you
      think it best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we think&mdash;for thunder sakes, Baxter, what was the matter with
      Marcellus? Was he out of his head? Was he loony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was perfectly sane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then, what&mdash;Zoeth,&rdquo; turning wildly to Mr. Hamilton, who
      still sat, pale and speechless, in his chair; &ldquo;Zoeth,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;did
      you ever hear such craziness in your life? Did you ever HEAR such stuff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth merely shook his head. His silence appeared to add to his friend&rsquo;s
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; he roared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth muttered something to the effect that he didn&rsquo;t know as he ever did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know! Yes, you do know, too. Speak up, why don&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t sit
      there like a ship&rsquo;s figgerhead, starin&rsquo; at nothin&rsquo;. You know it&rsquo;s
      craziness as well&rsquo;s I do. For God sakes, say somethin&rsquo;! TALK!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton talked&mdash;to this extent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be profane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Profane! Pup-pup-profane! You set there and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, jumpin&rsquo;,
      creepin&rsquo; Judas! I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Language&mdash;even his language&mdash;failed
      to express his feelings and he waved his fists and sputtered. Baxter
      seized the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you make your decision, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope you will
      consider the situation carefully. The girl is only seven years old; she
      has no relations anywhere, so far as we know. If you decline the trust a
      guardian will have to be appointed by the courts, I suppose. Who that
      guardian will be, or what will become of the poor child I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      know. And Captain Marcellus was perfectly sane; he knew what he was
      doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Well, then, I must say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute, please, I have a letter here which he wrote at the time he
      made his will. It is addressed to both of you. Here it is. Shall I read it
      to you, or had you rather read it yourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth answered. &ldquo;I guess maybe you&rsquo;d better read it, Judge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late Shadrach nor me are capable of readin&rsquo; much of anything
      just this minute. You read it. Shadrach, you be still now and listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain opened his mouth and raised a hand. &ldquo;Be still, Shadrach,&rdquo;
       repeated Zoeth. The hand fell. Captain Gould sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Zoeth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my batch closed long&rsquo;s I can.
      Heave ahead, Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter was a long one, covering several sheets of foolscap. It began:
    </p>
    <p>
      To Shadrach, Gould and Zoeth Hamilton, my old partners and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR SHAD AND ZOETH:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am writing this to you because I have known you pretty much all my life
      and you are the only real friends I have got in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was his friend, or I tried to be,&rdquo; commented Baxter, interrupting his
      reading; &ldquo;but he considered you two, and always spoke of you, as his
      oldest and nearest friends. He has often told me that he knew he could
      depend on you. Now listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letter went on to state that the writer realized his health was no
      longer good, that he was likely to die at any time and was quite
      reconciled.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should be glad to go [Captain Hall had written], if it was not for one
      thing. Since my wife was took from me I care precious little for life and
      the sooner it ends the better. That is the way I look at it. But I have a
      stepdaughter, Mary Augusta Lathrop, and for her sake I must stick to the
      ship as long as I can. I have not been the right kind of father to her. I
      have tried, but I don&rsquo;t seem to know how and I guess likely I was too old
      to learn. When I go she won&rsquo;t have a relation to look out for her. That
      has troubled me a lot and I have thought about it more than a little, I
      can tell you. And so I have decided to leave her in your care. I am hoping
      you will take charge of her and bring her up to be a good girl and a good
      woman, same as her mother was before her. I know you two will be just the
      ones for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire!&rdquo; broke in Shadrach, the irrepressible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach,&rdquo; continued Mr. Hamilton. &ldquo;Go on, Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baxter continued his reading. The letter told of the will, of the
      property, whatever it might be, left in trust for the child, and of the
      writer&rsquo;s desire that it might be used, when turned into money, for her
      education. There were two pages of rambling references to stocks and
      investments, the very vagueness of these references proving the weakening
      shrewdness and lack of business acumen of Captain Hall in his later years.
      Then came this:
    </p>
    <p>
      When this first comes to you I know you will both feel you are not fitted
      to take charge of my girl. You will say that neither of you has had any
      children of his own and you have not got experience in that line. But I
      have thought it over and I know I am right. I couldn&rsquo;t find better pilots
      afloat or ashore. Shadrach has been to sea and commanded vessels and is
      used to giving orders and having them carried out. He sailed mate with me
      for a good many voyages and was my partner ashore. I know him from truck
      to keelson. He is honest and able and can handle any craft. He will keep
      the girl on the course she ought to sail in her schooling and such and see
      she does not get on the rocks or take to cruising in bad company. Zoeth
      has had the land training. He is a pious man and as good outside the
      church as he is in, which is not always the case according to my
      experience. He has the name all up and down the Cape of being a square,
      honest storekeeper. He will look out for Mary&rsquo;s religious bringing up and
      learn her how to keep straight and think square. You are both of you
      different from each other in most ways but you are each of you honest and
      straight in his own way. I don&rsquo;t leave Mary in the care of one but in the
      charge of both. I know I am right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that very thing to me a good many times,&rdquo; put in the Judge. &ldquo;He
      seemed to feel that the very fact of your being men of different training
      and habits of thought made the combination ideal. Between you, so he
      seemed to think, the girl could not help but grow up as she should. I am
      almost through; there is a little more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I want you fellows to do this for my sake. I know you will, after you have
      thought it over. You and I have been through good times and bad together.
      We have made money and we have seen it go faster than it came. Shad has
      seen his savings taken away from him, partly because I trusted where he
      did not, and he never spoke a word of complaint nor found a mite of fault.
      Zoeth has borne my greatest trouble with me and though his share was far
      away bigger than mine, he kept me from breaking under it. I have not seen
      as much of you lately as I used to see, but that was my fault. Not my
      fault exactly, maybe, but my misfortune. I have not been the man I was and
      seeing you made me realize it. That is why I have not been to South
      Harniss and why I acted so queer when you came here. I was sort of
      ashamed, I guess. You remember when the old Hall and Company firm started
      business there were four of us who agreed to stick by each other through
      foul weather and fair till we died. One of that four broke his promise and
      pretty nigh wrecked us all, as he did wreck the firm. Now I am asking you
      two to stick by me and mine. I am trusting and believing that you are
      going to do it as I write this. When you read it I shan&rsquo;t be on hand. But,
      if I am where I can see and hear I shall still be believing you will do
      this last favor for your old messmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter folded the sheets of foolscap and laid them on the table.
      Then he took off his spectacles and wiped them with his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen?&rdquo; he said, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gould drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about as sick as it
      can be, and I cal&rsquo;late Zoeth feels the same; eh, Zoeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton did not answer. He neither spoke nor moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;it is not necessary that you make up your
      minds this instant. You will probably wish a few days to think the matter
      over in and then you can let me know what you decide. You have heard the
      letter and I have explained the situation. Are there any questions you
      would like to ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not far&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My mind is made up now. I did
      think there wasn&rsquo;t anything I wouldn&rsquo;t do for Marcellus. And I would have
      done anything in reason. But this ain&rsquo;t reason&mdash;it&rsquo;s what I called it
      in the beginnin&rsquo;, craziness. Me and Zoeth can&rsquo;t go crazy for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you decline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;m mighty sorry but of course we can&rsquo;t do such a thing. Me and
      Zoeth, one of us a bach all his life, and t&rsquo;other one a&mdash;a widower
      for twenty years, for us to take a child to bring up! My soul and body!
      Havin&rsquo; hung on to the heft of our senses so far, course we decline! We
      can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Mr. Hamilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth appeared to hesitate. Then he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a girl is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? She&rsquo;s a bright child, and a well-behaved one, generally
      speaking. Rather old for her years, and a little&mdash;well, peculiar.
      That isn&rsquo;t strange, considering the life she has led since her mother&rsquo;s
      death. But she is a good girl and a pretty little thing. I like her; so
      does my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was her at the cemetery, wasn&rsquo;t it? She was with that Hobbs woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. Shadrach and I met her when we was over here two years ago.
      I thought the one at the graveyard was her. Poor little critter! Where is
      she now; at the house&mdash;at Marcellus&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is, I suppose she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;do you cal&rsquo;late we could see her if we went there now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am sure you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Where? Home, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. I mean over to Marcellus&rsquo;s to see that little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth Hamilton! Do you mean to tell me&mdash;What do you want to see her
      for? Do you want to make it harder for her and for us and for all hands?
      What good is seein&rsquo; her goin&rsquo; to do? Ain&rsquo;t it twice as easy to say no now
      and be done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose likely &lsquo;twould be, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be right Marcellus asked us
      to do this thing for him and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; Judas! ASKED us! Do you mean to say you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; of doin&rsquo; what
      he asked? Are you loony, too? Are you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shh, Shadrach! He asked us, as a last favor, to take charge of his girl.
      I feel as you do that we can&rsquo;t do it, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t sensible nor possible for us
      to do it, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any buts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the very least we can do is go and see her and talk to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? So we&rsquo;ll feel meaner and more sneaky when we HAVE to say no? I
      shan&rsquo;t go to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Then I shall. You can wait here for me till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Zoeth! Hold on! Don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Hamilton was at the door and did not turn back. Judge Baxter, who
      was following him, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit right here, Captain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Make yourself as comfortable as you
      can. We shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Shadrach remained where he was. Then he, too, sprang to his
      feet. He overtook the lawyer just as the latter reached the side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Captain,&rdquo; exclaimed Baxter, &ldquo;changed your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed nothin&rsquo;. Zoeth&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; a fool of himself and I know it, but he
      ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be a fool ALL by himself. I&rsquo;ve seen him try it afore and
      &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grunted scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean there&rsquo;s safety in numbers, whether it&rsquo;s the number of fools or
      anything else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One idiot&rsquo;s a risky proposition, but two or
      three in a bunch can watch each other. Come on, Judge, and be the third.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The white house on Phinney&rsquo;s Hill looked desolate and mournful when the
      buggy containing Judge Baxter and his two companions drove into the yard.
      The wagon belonging to Mr. Hallett, the undertaker, was at the front door,
      and Hallett and his assistant were loading in the folding chairs. Mr.
      Hallett was whistling a popular melody, but, somehow or other, the music
      only emphasized the lonesomeness. There is little cheer in an undertaker&rsquo;s
      whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Gould, acting under the Judge&rsquo;s orders, piloted his horse up the
      driveway and into the back yard. The animal was made fast to the back
      fence and the three men alighted from the buggy and walked up to the side
      door of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Judge,&rdquo; whispered the Captain, as they halted by the step, &ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I can find out who loaded up that music-box chair on me, do
      you? If I could meet that feller for two or three minutes I might feel
      more reconciled at bein&rsquo; fool enough to come over here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs answered the knock at the door&mdash;she invited them in. When
      told that they had come to see Mary-&rsquo;Gusta she sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in her room,&rdquo; she said, rather sharply. &ldquo;She hadn&rsquo;t ought to be let
      out, but of course if you want to see her, Judge Baxter, I presume likely
      she&rsquo;ll have to be. I&rsquo;ll go fetch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Mrs. Hobbs,&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Has the
      child been behaving badly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs&rsquo; lean fingers clinched. &ldquo;Behavin&rsquo; badly!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I
      should say she had! I never was so mortified in my life. And at her own
      father&rsquo;s funeral, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done? She&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Hobbs hesitated, glanced at Captain Shadrach, and
      left her sentence unfinished. &ldquo;Never mind what she done,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t tell you now; I declare I&rsquo;d be ashamed to. I&rsquo;ll go get her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She marched from the room. Zoeth rubbed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems sort of put out, don&rsquo;t she,&rdquo; he observed, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baxter nodded. &ldquo;Susan Hobbs has the reputation of getting &lsquo;put out&rsquo; pretty
      often,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She has a temper and it isn&rsquo;t a long one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been takin&rsquo; care of Marcellus&rsquo;s girl?&rdquo; asked Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. As much care as the child has had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad snorted. It was evident that the housekeeper&rsquo;s manner had not
      impressed him favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have her take care of me, judgin&rsquo; by the
      way she looked just now. Say,&rdquo; hopefully, &ldquo;do you suppose SHE was the one
      fixed that chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard Mrs. Hobbs on the floor above, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Where are you? Answer me this minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be in that room she was talkin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; grumbled Shadrach.
      &ldquo;Tut! Tut! What a voice that is! Got a rasp to it like a rusty saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs was heard descending the stairs. Her face, when she reentered
      the sitting-room, was red and she looked more &ldquo;put out&rdquo; than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; she answered, angrily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; repeated Zoeth and Shadrach in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone?&rdquo; repeated the Judge. &ldquo;Do you mean she&rsquo;s run away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! She ain&rsquo;t run away&mdash;not for good; she knows better than
      that. She&rsquo;s sneaked off and hid, I suppose. But I know where she is. I&rsquo;ll
      have her here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was hurrying out again, but the Captain detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say? You know where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or I can guess. Nine chances to one she&rsquo;s out in that barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the barn? What&rsquo;s she doin&rsquo; there&mdash;playin&rsquo; horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. She&rsquo;s hidin&rsquo; in the carriage room. Seems as if the child was
      possessed to get out in that dusty place and perch herself in the old
      carryall. She calls it her playhouse and you&rsquo;d think &lsquo;twas Heaven the way
      she loves to stay there. But today of all days! And with her best clothes
      on! And after I expressly told her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; all right. Humph! Well, Zoeth, what do you say? Shall we go to
      Heaven and hunt for her? Maybe &lsquo;twill be the only chance some of us&rsquo;ll
      get, you can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; with a wink at Baxter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach! How you do talk!&rdquo; protested the shocked Mr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out to the barn and find the young-one ourselves,&rdquo; said the
      Captain. &ldquo;Seems the simplest thing to do, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to go at all,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get her and bring her
      here. Perhaps she ain&rsquo;t there, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if she ain&rsquo;t there we can come back again. Come on, boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to the door. The housekeeper would have accompanied them,
      but he prevented her doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble yourself, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find her. I&rsquo;m older&rsquo;n
      I used to be, but I ain&rsquo;t so blind but what I can locate a barn without a
      spyglass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be any trouble,&rdquo; protested the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but it might be. We&rsquo;ll go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the three were in the back yard, and the discomfited housekeeper was
      watching them from the door, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why that woman rubs my fur the wrong way, but she does.
      Isaiah Chase says he don&rsquo;t like mosquitoes &lsquo;cause they get on his nerves.
      I never thought I wore my nerves on the back of my neck, which is where
      Isaiah gets skeeter-bit mostly, but anyhow, wherever they be, that Hobbs
      woman bothers &lsquo;em. There&rsquo;s the barn, ain&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t look very heavenly,
      but it may seem that way after a spell in t&rsquo;other place. Now where&rsquo;s the
      carriage room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the carriage room was open, and they entered. A buggy and the
      muslin draped surrey were there, but no living creature was in sight. They
      listened, but heard nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta!&rdquo; called Baxter. &ldquo;Are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer. And then, from beneath the cover of the surrey, appeared a fat
      tortoise-shell cat, who jumped lightly to the floor, yawned, stretched,
      and blinked suspiciously at the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Shadrach. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one stowaway, anyhow. Maybe
      there&rsquo;s another; I&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;em come aboard in pairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge walked over to the surrey, and raised the cover. From behind it
      came a frightened little squeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you are!&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustle, a sob, and then a timid voice said, chokingly, &ldquo;Yes,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out,&rdquo; said the Judge, kindly. &ldquo;Come out; here are some friends who
      want to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another sob and then: &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. We won&rsquo;t hurt you. We only want to see you and talk with
      you, that&rsquo;s all. Come, that&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. We want to see you, anyway. I guess you&rsquo;re not very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I am. Is&mdash;is Mrs. Hobbs there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Come now, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment&rsquo;s wait, then, from beneath the cover, appeared a small foot and
      leg, the latter covered by a black stocking. The foot wiggled about,
      feeling for the step. It found it, the cover was thrown aside and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta appeared, a pathetic little figure, with rumpled hair and
      tear-stained cheeks. Rose and Rosette, the two dolls, were hugged in her
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter patted her on the head. Zoeth and Shadrach looked solemn and
      ill at ease. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta looked at the floor and sniffed dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;these two gentlemen are old friends of
      your father&rsquo;s and,&rdquo; with a pardonable stretching of the truth, &ldquo;they have
      come all the way from South Harniss to meet you. Now you must shake hands
      with them. They like little girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta obediently moved forward, shifted Rosette to the arm clasping
      Rose, and extended a hand. Slowly she raised her eyes, saw Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s
      mild, gentle face and then, beside it, the face of Captain Shadrach Gould.
      With a cry she dropped both dolls, ran back to the surrey and fumbled
      frantically with the dust cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baxter, surprised and puzzled, ran after her and prevented her climbing
      into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child struggled and then, bursting into a storm of sobs, hid her face
      in the dust cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; she sobbed, wildly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Honest
      I didn&rsquo;t. I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Please don&rsquo;t let him.
      PLEASE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge held her close and did his best to calm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, child,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s going to hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, they are. Mrs. Hobbs said she shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he
      knocked my&mdash;my head right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knocked your head off! Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hand and pointed a shaking finger straight at Captain
      Shadrach.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three of her hearers were surprised, of course, but in the case of the
      Captain himself amazement was coupled with righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-what?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Who said so? What kind of talk&rsquo;s that? Said I
      was goin&rsquo; to knock your head off? I was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baxter laughed. &ldquo;No, no, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re mistaken. Mrs.
      Hobbs couldn&rsquo;t have said any such thing. You&rsquo;re mistaken, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; with another sob; &ldquo;she did say so. She said he would knock
      my head&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;off and&mdash;and put me in jail, too. And
      I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it; honest, truly I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge looked at his companions and shook his head as if the conundrum
      was beyond his guessing. Captain Shad groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By fire!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;All hands have gone loony, young-ones and all.
      And,&rdquo; with conviction, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the road myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth Hamilton stepped forward and held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, dearie,&rdquo; he said, gently; &ldquo;come here and tell me all about it.
      Neither me nor the Cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to hurt you a mite. We like little girls,
      both of us do. Now you come and tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s sobs ceased. She looked at the speaker doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be scared,&rdquo; begged Zoeth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be good friends to
      you. We knew your father and he thought everything of us. You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; 
      to be afraid of folks that was your Pa&rsquo;s chums. You come here and let&rsquo;s
      talk it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Mary-&rsquo;Gusta crossed the room. Zoeth sat down upon an empty box near
      the door and lifted the girl to his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you ain&rsquo;t afraid of me, be you?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta shook her head, but her big eyes were fixed upon Captain
      Shadrach&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I ain&rsquo;t. But you wasn&rsquo;t the one I
      did it to. It was him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judging by the Captain&rsquo;s expression his conviction that all hands, himself
      included, had lost their reason was momentarily growing firmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ME?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You done somethin&rsquo; to me and I&mdash;well, by Judas,
      this is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach! What was it you done, Mary, that made you afraid of Cap&rsquo;n
      Gould? Tell me. I won&rsquo;t hurt you and I won&rsquo;t let anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU won&rsquo;t let&mdash;Zoeth Hamilton, I swan, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, Shadrach, for mercy sakes! Now, what was it, dearie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hesitated. Then she buried her face in Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s jacket
      and sobbed a confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I made it go,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&mdash;I broke the&mdash;the catch&mdash;and
      it was wound up and&mdash;and it went off. But I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t
      mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, course you didn&rsquo;t. We know you didn&rsquo;t. What was it that
      went off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The&mdash;the music chair. It was in the corner and Mr. Hallett took it
      and&mdash;and I couldn&rsquo;t say anything &lsquo;cause Mrs. Hobbs said I mustn&rsquo;t
      speak a word at the funeral. And&mdash;and he set in it and it played and&mdash;Oh,
      don&rsquo;t let him put me in jail! Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another burst of tears. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta clung tightly to the Hamilton jacket.
      Judge Baxter looked as if a light had suddenly broken upon the darkness of
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were responsible for the &lsquo;Campbells.&rsquo; I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;So she was the one. Well, I swan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth stroked the child&rsquo;s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, dearie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you worry about that. We
      didn&rsquo;t know who did it, but now we do and it&rsquo;s all right. We know you
      didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t&mdash;won&rsquo;t he knock my head off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, course he won&rsquo;t. Tell her so, Shadrach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach pulled at his beard. Then he burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt you for nothin&rsquo;, sis,&rdquo; he said, heartily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right
      and don&rsquo;t you fret about it. Accidents will happen even in the best
      regulated&mdash;er&mdash;funerals; though,&rdquo; with a broad grin, &ldquo;I hope
      another one like that&rsquo;ll never happen to ME. Now don&rsquo;t you cry any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta raised her head and regarded him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I be put in jail?&rdquo; she asked, more hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you won&rsquo;t. I never put anybody in jail in my life; though,&rdquo; with
      an emphatic nod, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some folks ought to go there for frightenin&rsquo; 
      children out of their senses. Did that Mrs. Hobbs tell you I was goin&rsquo; to&mdash;what
      was it?&mdash;knock your head off and all the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a&mdash;she&rsquo;s what she is. What else did she say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she said I was a bad, wicked child and she hoped I&rsquo;d be sent to
      the&mdash;the orphans&rsquo; home. If she was to have the care of me, she said,
      she&rsquo;d make me walk a chalk or know why. And she sent me to my room and
      said I couldn&rsquo;t have any supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth and the Captain looked at each other. Baxter frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the very day of her father&rsquo;s funeral,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I have any supper?&rdquo; begged Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful hungry; I didn&rsquo;t
      want much dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded. His tone, when he spoke, was not so mild as was usual with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have your supper,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and must I go to the orphans&rsquo; home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one answered at once. Zoeth and Captain Shad again looked at each other
      and the Judge looked at them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; repeated Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;d rather die,
      I guess, and go to Heaven, same as Mother and Father. But Mrs. Hobbs says
      they don&rsquo;t have any dolls nor cats in Heaven, so I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d want
      to go there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baxter walked to the window and looked out. Captain Shadrach reached into
      his pocket, produced a crumpled handkerchief, and blew his nose violently.
      Zoeth stroked the child&rsquo;s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, after a moment, &ldquo;how would you like to go over to
      South Harniss and&mdash;and see me and Cap&rsquo;n Gould a little while? Just
      make us a visit, you know. Think you&rsquo;d like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain started. &ldquo;Good land, Zoeth!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Be careful what
      you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; anything definite, Shadrach. I know how you feel about it.
      I just wanted to see how she felt herself, that&rsquo;s all. Think you&rsquo;d like
      that, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta thought it over. &ldquo;I guess maybe I would,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if I
      could take my dolls and David. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to leave David. Mrs. Hobbs
      don&rsquo;t like cats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment Mrs. Hobbs herself appeared in the doorway of the
      carriage room. She saw the child and her eyes snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she was here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought as much. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, what did you
      run away from that room for? Didn&rsquo;t I forbid you leavin&rsquo; it? She&rsquo;s been a
      bad girl, Judge Baxter,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t make her behave. I try my
      best, but I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach thrust both hands into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what to do,&rdquo; he said, sharply. &ldquo;You go into the house and put
      some of her things into a valise or satchel or somethin&rsquo;. And hurry up as
      fast as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put &lsquo;em in a satchel?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What for? Where&rsquo;s she goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; home along with me and Zoeth. And she&rsquo;s got to start inside
      of half an hour. You hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any &lsquo;buts&rsquo;; haven&rsquo;t got time for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton regarded his friend with an odd expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;do you realize what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo;? You said it, I didn&rsquo;t. Besides takin&rsquo; her home with us
      today don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;, does it? A visit won&rsquo;t hurt us. Visits don&rsquo;t
      bind anybody to anything. Jumpin&rsquo; Judas! I guess we&rsquo;ve got room enough in
      the house to have one young-one come visitin&rsquo; for&mdash;for a couple of
      days, if we want to. What are you makin&rsquo; such a fuss about? Here you,&rdquo;
       turning to the housekeeper, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you gone yet? You&rsquo;ve got just thirteen
      minutes to get that satchel ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hobbs departed, outraged dignity in her walk and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am&mdash;am I goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; faltered Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;. Unless, of course, you&rsquo;d rather stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather go, if&mdash;if I can take David and the dolls. Can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can she, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad, who was pacing the floor, turned savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you ask me that for?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;This is your doin&rsquo;s, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t
      mine. You said it first, didn&rsquo;t you? Yes, yes, let her take the dolls and
      cats&mdash;and cows and pigs, too, if she wants to. Jumpin&rsquo; fire! What do
      I care? If a feller&rsquo;s bound to be a fool, a little live stock more or less
      don&rsquo;t make him any bigger one. . . . Land sakes! I believe she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      cry again. Don&rsquo;t do that! What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were starting once more in the girl&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think you want me,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;If you did you&mdash;you
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was greatly taken aback. He hesitated, tugged at his beard,
      and then, walking over to the child, took her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind the way I talk, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m liable to talk
      &lsquo;most any way, but I don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; by it. I like little girls, same
      as Zoeth said. And I ain&rsquo;t mad about the jig-tune chair, neither. Say,&rdquo;
       with a sudden inspiration; &ldquo;here we are settin&rsquo; here and one of our
      passengers has left the dock. We got to find that cat, ain&rsquo;t we? What did
      you say his name was&mdash;Solomon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; David.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David, sure enough. If I&rsquo;d been up in Scripture the way Zoeth&mdash;Mr.
      Hamilton, here&mdash;is, I wouldn&rsquo;t have made that mistake, would I? Come
      on, let&rsquo;s you and me go find David and break the news to him. Say, he&rsquo;ll
      be some surprised to find he&rsquo;s booked for a foreign v&rsquo;yage, won&rsquo;t he? Come
      on, we&rsquo;ll go find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta slowly rose from Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s knee. She regarded the Captain
      steadily for a moment; then, hand in hand, they left the barn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter whistled. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I must say I didn&rsquo;t expect
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth smiled. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t many better men than Shadrach Gould,&rdquo; he
      observed, quietly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, even though she lives to be a very old woman, will never
      forget that ride to South Harniss. It was the longest ride she had ever
      taken, and that of itself would have made it unforgettable. Then, too, she
      was going visiting, and she had never been visiting before. Also, she was
      leaving Mrs. Hobbs and, for a time at least, that lady could not remind
      her of her queerness and badness. More than all, she was going on a
      journey, a real journey, like a grown-up or a person in a story, and her
      family&mdash;David and the dolls&mdash;were journeying with her. What the
      journey might mean to her, or to what sort of place she was going&mdash;these
      questions did not trouble her in the least. Childlike, she was quite
      satisfied with the wonderful present, and to the future, even the dreaded
      orphans&rsquo; home, she gave not a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perched on the buggy seat, squeezed in between Captain Shad and Mr.
      Hamilton, she gazed wide-eyed at the houses and fields and woods along the
      roadside. She did not speak, unless spoken to, and the two men spoke but
      seldom, each apparently thinking hard. Occasionally the Captain would
      sigh, or whistle, or groan, as if his thoughts were disturbing and most
      unusual. Once he asked her if she was comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; a good time? Like to go to ride, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta assumed her most grown-up air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just love to travel. It&rsquo;s been the dream of my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh! I want to know!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Shadrach; then he shook
      his head, chuckled, and ordered the horse to hurry up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dolls were arranged in a row against the back of the dashboard. In
      front of them, and between the Captain&rsquo;s feet and Zoeth&rsquo;s, the battered
      satchel containing the child&rsquo;s everyday dress and visiting essentials was
      squeezed. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s feet stuck straight out and rested on the top of
      the satchel. David, in a basket with the lid tied fast, was planted
      between the last mentioned feet. David did not appear to share his&mdash;or
      her&mdash;owner&rsquo;s love of travel. The cat wailed lugubriously at
      intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth made the next attempt at conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never been to South Harniss, have you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; gravely. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; remembering the housekeeper&rsquo;s final charge not
      to forget her manners, if she had any, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll like it very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are, eh? Well, that&rsquo;s nice. What makes you so sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta reflected. She remembered what Mrs. Bailey had said after a
      week&rsquo;s visit in Bayport, which is fourteen miles from Ostable. &ldquo;I think
      everybody enjoys a change of air,&rdquo; she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul and body!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad looked down at his small passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you, sis?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seven. But I ain&rsquo;t a sis; I haven&rsquo;t got any brothers or sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, that&rsquo;s a fact, too, now I come to think of it. How old did you
      say; seventy, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Seven. Did you think I said seventy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? No, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be seventy. If I was I&rsquo;d be lots bigger, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; I presume likely you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More reflection. Then: &ldquo;If I was seventy I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t have asked
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! Wouldn&rsquo;t I? Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause grown-up folks don&rsquo;t like to be asked how old they are. I asked
      Mrs. Hobbs how old she was once and she didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. She told me to mind my own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed aloud. Then, turning to Mr. Hamilton, he said: &ldquo;Say,
      Zoeth, Isaiah&rsquo;ll be a little mite surprised when he sees this craft make
      port, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth smiled. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. I&rsquo;d like to have a tintype of Isaiah&rsquo;s face. Well, sis&mdash;er,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I mean&mdash;there&rsquo;s South Harniss dead ahead. How do you
      like the looks of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had emerged from a long stretch of woods and were at the summit of a
      little hill. From the crest of this hill the road wound down past an old
      cemetery with gray, moss-covered slate tombstones, over a bridge between a
      creek and a good-sized pond, on through a clump of pines, where it joined
      the main highway along the south shore of the Cape. This highway, in turn,
      wound and twisted&mdash;there are few straight roads on Cape Cod&mdash;between
      other and lower hills until it became a village street, the main street of
      South Harniss. The sun was low in the west and its light bathed the
      clustered roofs in a warm glow, touched windows and vanes with fire, and
      twinkled and glittered on the waters of Nantucket Sound, which filled the
      whole southern horizon. There was little breeze and the smoke from the
      chimneys rose almost straight. So, too, did the smoke from the distant
      tugs and steamers. There were two or three schooners far out, and nearer
      shore, a sailboat. A pretty picture, one which artists have painted and
      summer visitors enthused over many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mary-&rsquo;Gusta it was new and wonderful. The child was in a mood to like
      almost anything just then. Mrs. Hobbs was miles away and the memory of the
      music chair and her own disgrace and shame were but memories. She drew a
      long breath and looked and looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it, do you?&rdquo; asked Zoeth, echoing his friend&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta nodded. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach nodded. &ldquo;Best town on earth, if I do say it,&rdquo; he said,
      emphatically. &ldquo;So you think it&rsquo;s lovely, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Then, pointing, she asked: &ldquo;Is that your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grinned. &ldquo;Well, no, not exactly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the town
      hall. Nobody lives there but the selectmen and they ain&rsquo;t permanent
      boarders&mdash;that is, I have hopes some of &lsquo;em &lsquo;ll move after
      town-meetin&rsquo; day. Our house is over yonder, down nigh the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old horse pricked up his ears at sight of home and the buggy moved
      faster. It rolled through the main street, where the Captain and Mr.
      Hamilton were kept busy answering hails and returning bows from citizens,
      male and female. Through the more thickly settled portion of the village
      it moved, until at a point where there were fewer shops and the houses
      were older and less up-to-date, it reached the corner of a narrow cross
      road. There it stopped before a frame building bearing the sign, &ldquo;Hamilton
      and Company, Dry Goods, Groceries, Boots and Shoes and Notions.&rdquo; There was
      a narrow platform at the front of the building and upon this platform were
      several men, mostly of middle age or older. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta noticed that most
      of these men were smoking. If she had been older she might have noticed
      that each man either sat upon the platform steps or leaned against the
      posts supporting its roof. Not one was depending solely upon his own
      muscles for support; he sat upon or leaned against something wooden and
      substantial.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the buggy drew alongside the platform the men evinced considerable
      interest. Not enough to make them rise or relinquish support, but
      interest, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Shad!&rdquo; hailed one. &ldquo;Home again, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty big funeral, was it?&rdquo; drawled another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that you got aboard?&rdquo; queried a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach did not answer. Mr. Hamilton leaned forward. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
      Annabel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s inside,&rdquo; replied the first questioner. &ldquo;Want to see her? Hi, Jabe,&rdquo;
       turning his head and addressing one of the group nearest the door, &ldquo;tell
      Annabel, Zoeth and Shad&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jabe,&rdquo; who was propped against a post, languidly pushed himself away from
      it, opened the door behind him and shouted: &ldquo;Annabel, come out here!&rdquo; Then
      he slouched back and leaned against the post again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and a stout, red-faced young woman appeared. She looked
      much more like an Eliza than an Annabel. She had a newspaper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; she drawled. &ldquo;Who was that hollerin&rsquo;? Was it you, Jabez Hedges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jabez did not take the trouble to answer. Instead he took a hand from his
      trousers pocket and waved it toward the buggy. Annabel looked; then she
      came down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see you got back all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get along in the store?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously.
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t none to speak of,&rdquo; replied Annabel carelessly. &ldquo;Sold a couple of
      spools of cotton and&mdash;and some salt pork and sugar. Ezra Howland
      bought the pork. He wasn&rsquo;t satisfied; said there wasn&rsquo;t enough lean in it
      to suit him, but I let him have it a cent cheaper, so he took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton seemed a trifle disappointed. &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; he asked, with
      a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. No, &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t neither, come to think of it. Rastus Young&rsquo;s wife, come
      in with her two young-ones and bought some shoes and hats for &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she pay cash?&rdquo; demanded Captain Shadrach sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; she said charge &lsquo;em up, so I done it. Say, ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo; in pretty
      soon? It&rsquo;s &lsquo;most my supper time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth opened his mouth to answer, but the Captain got ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our supper time, too,&rdquo; he said, crisply. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve had it you can
      have yours. Get dap, January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse, whose name was Major but who was accustomed to being addressed
      by almost any name, jogged on. Mr. Hamilton sighed once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid one of us had ought to stayed in the store, Shadrach,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Annabel means well, she&rsquo;s real obligin&rsquo;; but she ain&rsquo;t a good hand
      at business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach snorted. &ldquo;Obligin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones that
      was obligin&rsquo; when we agreed to pay her seventy-five cents for settin&rsquo; 
      astern of the counter and readin&rsquo; the Advocate. I told you when you hired
      her that she wasn&rsquo;t good for nothin&rsquo; but ballast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Shadrach. I&rsquo;d ought to have stayed to home and kept store myself.
      But I did feel as if I must go to Marcellus&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sellin&rsquo; them Youngs a whole passel of stuff and lettin&rsquo; &lsquo;em charge it
      up!&rdquo; went on Shadrach. &ldquo;They owe us enough now to keep a decent family all
      winter. Reg&rsquo;lar town dead-beats, that&rsquo;s what they are. You couldn&rsquo;t get a
      cent out of Rastus Young if you were to run a dredge through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton groaned remorsefully. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only stayed at home!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d stayed to home you&rsquo;d have charged up the stuff just the same as
      she did. You&rsquo;re the softest thing, outside of a sponge, in this town.
      Anybody can impose on you, and you know it, Zoeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth&rsquo;s habitual mildness gave way to resentment, mild resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Shadrach,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;how you talk! You was the one that charged
      up the last things Rastus&rsquo;s folks bought. You know you was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked as if he had been caught napping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that got to do with it?&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but
      some corn meal and a few yards of calico. How could I help chargin&rsquo; it up,
      with that woman cryin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo; on about their havin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; to eat nor
      wear in the house? I couldn&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em starve, could I? Nor freeze
      neither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas only last week she did it,&rdquo; protested his partner. &ldquo;Folks don&rsquo;t
      freeze in April, seems to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, be still! Don&rsquo;t talk no more about it. By fire!&rdquo; with a sudden change
      of subject and a burst of enthusiasm, &ldquo;look at that horse, will you!
      Turned right in at the gate without my pullin&rsquo; the helm once or sayin&rsquo; a
      word&mdash;knows as much as a Christian, that horse does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The buggy had rocked and plowed its way over the hummocks and through the
      sand of the narrow lane and was at the top of a grass-covered knoll, a
      little hill. At the foot of the hill was the beach, strewn with seaweed,
      and beyond, the Sound, its waters now a rosy purple in the sunset light.
      On the slope of the hill toward the beach stood a low, rambling, white
      house, a barn, and several sheds and outbuildings. There were lilac bushes
      by the front door of the house, a clam-shell walk from the lane to that
      door, and, surrounding the whole, a whitewashed picket fence. A sandy
      rutted driveway led from the rear of the house and the entrance of the
      barn down to a big gate, now wide open. It was through this gateway and
      along this drive that the sagacious Major was pulling the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta stared at the house. As she stared the back door was thrown
      open and a tall, thin man came out. He was in his shirtsleeves, his arms
      were bare to the elbow, and to Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s astonishment he wore an
      apron, a gingham apron similar to those worn by Mrs. Hobbs when at work in
      the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy, there, Isaiah!&rdquo; hailed the Captain. &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the apron took a big nickel watch from the upper pocket of
      his vest, looked at it, and shook his head. Upon his face, which was long
      and thin like the rest of him, there was a grieved expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little mite late, ain&rsquo;t we, Isaiah?&rdquo; said Zoeth, hastily. &ldquo;Hope we
      ain&rsquo;t kept supper waitin&rsquo; too long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall man returned the watch to the pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only twenty-three minutes, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he drawled, with the resignation
      of a martyr. &ldquo;Twenty-three minutes ain&rsquo;t much in a lifetime, maybe&mdash;but
      it don&rsquo;t help fried potatoes none. Them potatoes was ready at half-past
      five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t six yet,&rdquo; protested Captain Shad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t, but it&rsquo;s twenty-three minutes later&rsquo;n half-past five. Last
      thing you said to me was, &lsquo;Have supper ready at half-past five!&rsquo; I had it
      ready. Them potatoes went on the fire at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; interrupted the Captain. &ldquo;Never mind the potatoes. We&rsquo;ll
      &lsquo;tend to them in a minute. Give us a hand with this dunnage. There&rsquo;s a
      satchel here and some more stuff. Sooner this craft&rsquo;s unloaded the sooner
      we can eat. All ashore that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth climbed out of the buggy. He lifted their passenger to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s where Cap&rsquo;n Gould and I live. This is Mr.
      Isaiah Chase. Isaiah, this is Mary Lathrop, Cap&rsquo;n Marcellus&rsquo;s little girl.
      She&rsquo;s come to&mdash;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make us a little visit,&rdquo; put in the Captain, promptly. &ldquo;You want to
      get acquainted with Isaiah, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta; he&rsquo;s cook and steward for me and
      Mr. Zoeth. That&rsquo;s right; shake hands and be sociable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta extended her hand and Mr. Chase, after wiping his own hand on
      the apron, pumped hers up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleased to meet you,&rdquo; he said, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the dunnage,&rdquo; said Captain Shad. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the satchel and&mdash;and
      the other things. Look out for that basket! LOOK OUT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase had seized the basket and swung it out of the buggy. David,
      frightened at the sudden aerial ascension, uttered a howl. Isaiah dropped
      the basket as if it was red hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in tunket!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but a cat,&rdquo; explained the Captain. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twon&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cat! What&mdash;whose cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, running to the rescue. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real good cat. He
      ain&rsquo;t cross; he&rsquo;s scared, that&rsquo;s all. Honest, he ain&rsquo;t cross. Are you,
      David?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      David howled and clawed at the cover of the basket. Mr. Chase backed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You fetched a cat&mdash;here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin we fetched it.&rdquo; Captain Shadrach was evidently losing patience.
      &ldquo;Did you think we&rsquo;d fetch an elephant? Now get out them&mdash;them doll
      babies and things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah stared at the dolls. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta stopped patting the basket and
      hastened to the side of the buggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the dollies,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later they entered the house. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta bore three of the
      dolls. Mr. Hamilton carried the other two, and Isaiah, with the valise in
      one hand and the basket containing the shrieking David at arm&rsquo;s length in
      the other, led the way. Captain Shad, after informing them that he would
      be aboard in a jiffy, drove on to the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room they first entered was the kitchen. It was small, rather untidy,
      and smelt strongly of fish and the fried potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right along with me, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; said Zoeth. &ldquo;Fetch the satchel,
      Isaiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; shouted the perturbed &ldquo;cook and steward.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&mdash;what in
      the nation will I do with this critter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;critter&rdquo; was David, who was apparently turning somersaults in the
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth hesitated. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta settled the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him right down, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be better soon as he&rsquo;s put
      down. He&rsquo;s never traveled before and it&rsquo;s kind of strange to him. He&rsquo;ll be
      all right and I&rsquo;ll come back and let him out pretty soon. Mayn&rsquo;t I, Mr.&mdash;Mr.
      Chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh? Yes, yes, you can if you want to, I cal&rsquo;late. I don&rsquo;t want to,
      that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He deposited the basket on the floor at his feet. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta looked at it
      rather dubiously and for an instant seemed about to speak, but she did
      not, and followed Mr. Hamilton from the kitchen, through the adjoining
      room, evidently the dining-room, and up a narrow flight of stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll put her in the spare room, won&rsquo;t we, Isaiah?&rdquo; queried
      Zoeth, with some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah grunted. &ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; he said, ungraciously, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no other place
      that I know of. Bed ain&rsquo;t made, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spare room was of good size, and smelled shut up and musty, as spare
      rooms in the country usually do. It was furnished with a bureau,
      washstand, and two chairs, each painted in a robin&rsquo;s egg blue with sprays
      of yellow roses. There were several pictures on the walls, their subjects
      religious and mournful. The bed was, as Mr. Chase had said, not made; in
      fact it looked as if it had not been made for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to make up that bed for more&rsquo;n a month,&rdquo; explained
      Isaiah. &ldquo;Last time &lsquo;twas unmade was when Zoeth had that minister from
      Trumet here of a Saturday and Sunday. Every day I&rsquo;ve cal&rsquo;lated to make up
      that bed, but I don&rsquo;t seem to get no time. I&rsquo;m so everlastin&rsquo; busy I don&rsquo;t
      get time for nothin&rsquo;, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can make the bed,&rdquo; declared Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, eagerly. &ldquo;I can make beds real
      well. Mrs. Hobbs told me so&mdash;once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other. Before either could speak a tremendous
      racket broke out on the floor below, a sound of something&mdash;or
      somebody&mdash;tumbling about, a roar in a human voice and a feline
      screech. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta rushed for the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew he would,&rdquo; she said, frantically. &ldquo;I was afraid somebody would. It
      was RIGHT in front of the door. Oh! David, dear! I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;m
      a-comin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the kitchen came Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s voice. It sounded excited and
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who in blazes left that dum critter right under my feet?&rdquo; he hollered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      swan, I believe I&rsquo;ve broke my neck&mdash;or his&mdash;one or t&rsquo;other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Zoeth and Isaiah reached the kitchen they found the Captain sitting
      in a chair, rubbing his knees, and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta seated on the floor beside
      the open basket, hugging the frightened and struggling David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; panted the child. &ldquo;I was so afraid he&rsquo;d
      be killed. You ain&rsquo;t killed, are you, David?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      David appeared to be remarkably sound and active. He wriggled from his
      owner&rsquo;s arms and bolted under the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice he ain&rsquo;t hurt, Mr.&mdash;I
      mean Cap&rsquo;n Gould?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad rubbed his knee. &ldquo;Um&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said, with elaborate
      sarcasm; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lovely. Course I don&rsquo;t mind breakin&rsquo; both MY legs, but if
      that cat had been&mdash;er&mdash;bruised or anything I should have felt
      bad. Well, Isaiah,&rdquo; he added, tartly, turning to the grinning &ldquo;steward,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;are them fried potatoes of yours real or just in your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Why&mdash;why they&rsquo;re right there on the stove, Cap&rsquo;n Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know! Then suppose you put &lsquo;em on the table. I&rsquo;m hungry and I&rsquo;d
      like to eat one more square meal afore somethin&rsquo; else happens to finish me
      altogether. By fire! if this ain&rsquo;t been a day! First that chair, and then
      that will and letter of Marcellus&rsquo;s, and then this. Humph! Come on, all
      hands, let&rsquo;s eat supper. I need somethin&rsquo; solid to brace me up for
      tomorrow&rsquo;s program; if it&rsquo;s up to this, I&rsquo;ll need strength to last it
      through. Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That first supper in the white house by the shore was an experience for
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Mrs. Hobbs, in spite of her faultfinding and temper, had been
      a competent and careful housekeeper. Meals which she prepared were well
      cooked and neatly served. This meal was distinctly different. There was
      enough to eat&mdash;in fact, an abundance&mdash;fried cod and the fried
      potatoes and hot biscuits and dried-apple pie; but everything was put upon
      the table at the same time, and Mr. Chase sat down with the others and did
      not even trouble to take off his apron. The tablecloth was not very clean
      and the knives and forks and spoons did not glitter like those the child
      had been accustomed to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Hamilton, to whom most of the things of this world&mdash;his
      beloved store excepted&mdash;seemed to be unessential trivialities, spoke
      of the table linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he observed, in his gentle and hesitating way, &ldquo;this
      tablecloth&rsquo;s sort of spotted up. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad&rsquo;s reply was emphatic and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if &lsquo;twas breakin&rsquo; out with chicken-pox,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we
      got a clean one in the locker, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase&rsquo;s face assumed an aggrieved expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course we have,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t know you was goin&rsquo; to have
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did we. But we could stand a clean table-cloth, even at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to do besides changin&rsquo; tablecloths every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day! Every Thanksgivin&rsquo; Day, you mean. This one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look-a-here, Cap&rsquo;n Shad; you know well as I do that Sarah J. never
      come to do the washin&rsquo; last week. She was down with the grip and couldn&rsquo;t
      move. If you expect me to do washin&rsquo; as well as cook and sweep and keep
      house and&mdash;and shovel snow, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shovel snow! What kind of talk&rsquo;s that? There ain&rsquo;t been any snow since
      February.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make no difference. When there was I shoveled it, didn&rsquo;t I? It
      ain&rsquo;t no use; I try and try, but I can&rsquo;t give satisfaction and I might&rsquo;s
      well quit. I don&rsquo;t have to stay here and slave myself to death. I can get
      another job. There&rsquo;s folks in this town that&rsquo;s just dyin&rsquo; to have me work
      for em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach muttered something to the effect that if Isaiah did work
      for them they might die sooner. Mr. Chase rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, with dignity. &ldquo;All right, this settles it. I&rsquo;m
      through. After all the years I sailed cook along with you, Shad Gould, and
      after you beggin&rsquo; me&mdash;yes, sir, beggin&rsquo; on your knees, as you might
      say, for me to run this house for you long as you lived&mdash;after that,
      to&mdash;to&mdash;Good-by. I&rsquo;ll try not to lay it up against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moving&mdash;not hastily, but actually moving&mdash;toward the
      kitchen door. Zoeth, who was evidently much disturbed, rose and laid a
      hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, Isaiah,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t act so. We ain&rsquo;t findin&rsquo; any
      fault. Shadrach wasn&rsquo;t findin&rsquo; fault, was you, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, course I wasn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t talk so foolish, Isaiah. Nobody wants you
      to quit. All I said was&mdash;Come back here and set down. Your tea&rsquo;s
      gettin&rsquo; all cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Mary-&rsquo;Gusta it seemed as if the tea had been at least cool to begin
      with. However, Mr. Chase suffered himself to be led back to the table and
      attacked his supper in injured silence. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta offered a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I could wash a tablecloth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always wash my dolls&rsquo; 
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her three companions were plainly surprised. The Captain was the first to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I do. And,&rdquo; with a glance at the silver, &ldquo;I can scour knives
      and forks and spoons, too. I used to help Mrs. Hobbs scour &lsquo;em sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Shadrach had no remark to make. He gazed at the child, then at Zoeth,
      and drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as supper was over the Captain and Mr. Hamilton hastened up to the
      village and the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better go to bed pretty soon, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; said Zoeth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      tired, I know. Isaiah&rsquo;ll make your bed for you. We&rsquo;ll be on hand and see
      you first thing in the morning. Isaiah&rsquo;ll go up with you and blow out your
      light and all. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain said good night also and the pair hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at ten o&rsquo;clock they returned they found Mr. Chase up and awaiting
      them. Isaiah had a story to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never see a young-one like that in this world,&rdquo; declared Isaiah. &ldquo;You
      know what she done after you left? Helped me do the dishes. Yes, sir, by
      time, that&rsquo;s what she done. And she wiped &lsquo;em first-rate, too; good enough
      to satisfy ME, and you know that means somethin&rsquo; &lsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t easy to
      satisfy. And talk! Say, I never had a child talk same as she does. How old
      is she, for the land sakes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth told them the visitor&rsquo;s age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe so,&rdquo; went on Isaiah, &ldquo;but she don&rsquo;t talk seven; nigher
      seventeen, if you ask me. Pumpin&rsquo; me about funerals, she was, and about
      folks dyin&rsquo; and so on. Said she cal&rsquo;lated she&rsquo;d have a doll&rsquo;s funeral some
      time. &lsquo;For mercy sakes, what for?&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you think up anything
      pleasanter&rsquo;n that to play? That kind of game would give me the blue
      creeps!&rsquo; She, thought that over&mdash;she generally thinks about a thing
      for five minutes afore she talks about it&mdash;and says she, &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; 
      she says, &lsquo;but a person must go to funerals and so it&rsquo;s better to get used
      to &lsquo;em and know how to behave. I shouldn&rsquo;t want my dolls,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;to
      do things at funerals that make people feel bad and laugh.&rsquo; I couldn&rsquo;t get
      that through my head. &lsquo;If they felt bad they wouldn&rsquo;t laugh, would they?&rsquo; 
      says I. &lsquo;THEY wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;the ones that felt bad wouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says she,
      &lsquo;but others might laugh at them. And that would make the person who was to
      blame feel TERRIBLY.&rsquo; Now what was all that about? Can you make any sense
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach smiled sheepishly. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late me and Zoeth have an idea
      what she was drivin&rsquo; at,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go on, Isaiah; what else did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What didn&rsquo;t she say? Wanted to know if I thought God would knock
      anybody&rsquo;s head off that had done wrong, even if they didn&rsquo;t mean to. Yes,
      sir, that&rsquo;s what she said&mdash;-if God would knock anybody&rsquo;s head off.
      Mine pretty nigh come off when she said that. I told her that, fur&rsquo;s I
      knew, He wasn&rsquo;t in the habit of doin&rsquo; it. She said that Mrs. Hobbs told
      her that if she wasn&rsquo;t punished for her wickedness in this world she would
      be in the next. She was real kind of scared about it, seemed to me. Now
      what&rsquo;s she done that&rsquo;s wicked, a little critter like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth said nothing, but he looked vexed and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d knock SOMEBODY&rsquo;S head off if I had my way,&rdquo; observed Shadrach. &ldquo;Or if
      I didn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d like to. Where is she now, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s up in the spare room, asleep I cal&rsquo;late. And she&rsquo;s got her dolls
      along with her, three on one side and two on t&rsquo;other. Wanted me to be sure
      and wake all hands of &lsquo;em up on time in the mornin&rsquo;. He, he! She undressed
      them dolls, every one of &lsquo;em, afore they turned in. Oh, yes, and she
      helped me make the bed, too. She CAN make a bed, blessed if she can&rsquo;t. And
      all the time a-talkin&rsquo;, one minute like a child and the next like a
      forty-year-old woman. She&rsquo;s the queerest young-one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s had a kind of queer bringin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; said Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that&mdash;where&rsquo;s Saul&mdash;er&mdash;Elijah&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
      name&mdash;David?&rdquo; asked the Captain. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out in the barn, locked in. She had to go out along with me when I
      toted him there, and kiss him good night and tell him not to be
      frightened, and goodness knows what all&mdash;you&rsquo;d think she was that
      cat&rsquo;s mother, to hear her. How long&rsquo;s she goin&rsquo; to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Shadrach, hastily. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t settled yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you come to fetch her over here? You&rsquo;re the last ones I ever
      thought would be fetchin&rsquo; a child to visit you. Say, you ain&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; 
      to keep her for good, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth hesitated. Shadrach&rsquo;s answer was emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course not,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;What do Zoeth and me know about managin&rsquo; a
      child? Keep her for good, the idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah chuckled. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cordin&rsquo; to my notion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t have to
      know much. You wouldn&rsquo;t have to manage her. If she wasn&rsquo;t managin&rsquo; you&mdash;yes,
      and me, too&mdash;inside of a month, I&rsquo;d miss my guess. She&rsquo;s a born
      manager. You ought to see her handle them dolls and that cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two partners of Hamilton and Company went upstairs to their own
      bedrooms they opened the door of the spare room and peeped in.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s head and those of the dolls were in a row upon the pillow.
      It was a strange sight in that room and that house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; whispered Zoeth. &ldquo;And this mornin&rsquo; we never dreamed of such a
      thing. How long this day has been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judgin&rsquo; by the state of my nerves and knees it&rsquo;s been two year,&rdquo; replied
      Shadrach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve aged that much, I swan to man. Humph! I wonder if
      Marcellus knows what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was not loud, but it or the lamplight in her face awakened
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. She stirred, opened her eyes and regarded them sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it mornin&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied Zoeth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only ten o&rsquo;clock. Captain Shadrach and I
      was goin&rsquo; to bed and we looked in to see if you was all right, that&rsquo;s all.
      You must go right to sleep again, dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, obediently. Then she added, &ldquo;I said my
      prayers to myself but I&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;em to you if you want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The embarrassed Captain would have protested, but the girl&rsquo;s mind seemed
      to be made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I will say &lsquo;em again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in &lsquo;em maybe
      you&rsquo;d ought to hear.&rdquo; She closed her eyes. &ldquo;Please God bless Father&mdash;Oh,
      I forgot&mdash;bless Mrs. Hobbs and Cap&rsquo;n Gould and Mr. Hamilton. I
      thought I&rsquo;d ask him to bless you, you know, because I&rsquo;m visitin&rsquo; here. And
      bless David and Rose and Rosette and Emma and Christobel and Minnehaha.
      They&rsquo;re my dolls. And please, God, forgive me for breakin&rsquo; the music chair
      and makin&rsquo; it go off, because you know I am very sorry and won&rsquo;t do it
      again. And&mdash;and, Oh, yes!&mdash;bless Mr. Chase, Amen. You don&rsquo;t mind
      my puttin&rsquo; you and Mr. Chase in, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dearie, not a mite,&rdquo; said Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad, looking more embarrassed than ever, shook his head. &ldquo;Good
      night,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Zoeth hesitated, then he walked over and kissed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, little girl,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Hamilton,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Then she turned expectantly
      toward the Captain. Shadrach fidgeted, turned to go, and then, turning
      back, strode to the bed, brushed the soft cheek with his rough one and
      hastened out into the hall. Zoeth followed him, bearing the lamp. At the
      door of the Captain&rsquo;s room, they paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good night, Zoeth,&rdquo; said Shadrach, brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Shadrach. This&mdash;this is queer business for you and me,
      ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think &lsquo;twas. Humph! You said this morning that maybe Marcellus
      was alongside of us today. If he is he knows what&rsquo;s happened, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he knows that and more, Shadrach. Perhaps he can see what&rsquo;ll
      happen in the future. Perhaps he knows that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, if he does, he knows a heap more&rsquo;n I do. Good night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta awoke next morning to find the sun shining in at the window of
      her bedroom. She had no means of knowing the time, but she was certain it
      must be very late and, in consequence, was almost dressed when Isaiah
      knocked at the door to tell her breakfast would be ready pretty soon. A
      few minutes later she appeared in the kitchen bearing the pitcher from the
      washstand in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin&rsquo; with that?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Chase, who was leaning against
      the door-post looking out into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin&rsquo; to fill it,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any water to wash
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah sniffed. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had no time to fill wash pitchers,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;That one&rsquo;s been on my mind for more&rsquo;n a fortni&rsquo;t but I&rsquo;ve had other
      things to do. You can wash yourself in that basin in the sink. That&rsquo;s what
      the rest of us do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta obediently washed in the tin basin and rubbed her face and
      hands dry upon the roller towel behind the closet door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I late for breakfast?&rdquo; she asked, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not. Ain&rsquo;t had breakfast yet. Cap&rsquo;n Shad&rsquo;s out to the barn
      &lsquo;tendin&rsquo; to the horse and Zoeth&rsquo;s feedin&rsquo; the hens. They&rsquo;ll be in pretty
      soon, if we have luck. Course it&rsquo;s TIME for breakfast, but that&rsquo;s nothing.
      I&rsquo;m the only one that has to think about time in this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl regarded him thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have to work awful hard, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Chase?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked at her suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. I just guessed it from what you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, you guessed right. I don&rsquo;t have many spare minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Are you a perfect slave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hobbs says she is a perfect slave when she has to work hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mrs. Hobbs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she keeps house&mdash;that is, she used to keep house for my
      father over in Ostable. I don&rsquo;t suppose she will any more now he&rsquo;s dead.
      She&rsquo;ll be glad, I guess. Perhaps she won&rsquo;t have to be a perfect slave now.
      She used to wear aprons same as you do. I never saw a man wear an apron
      before. Do you have to wear one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? Have to? No, course I don&rsquo;t have to unless I want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she went on, after a moment, &ldquo;it saves your pants. You&rsquo;d get
      &lsquo;em all spotted up if you didn&rsquo;t wear the apron. Pneumonia is a good thing
      to take out Spots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pneumonia. . . . No, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s pneumonia that
      makes you sick. Somethin&rsquo; else takes out the spots. I know now; it&rsquo;s
      am-monia. It&rsquo;s very good for spots but you mustn&rsquo;t smell the bottle. I
      smelled the bottle once and it went right up into my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you talkin&rsquo; about? The bottle went up into your head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the ammonia smell did. It was awful; like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo; she
      paused, evidently in search of a simile; &ldquo;like sneezin&rsquo; backwards,&rdquo; she
      added. &ldquo;It was terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah laughed. &ldquo;I should think &lsquo;twould be,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Sneezin&rsquo; 
      backwards! Ho, ho! That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s eyes were still fixed upon the apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;I mean Cap&rsquo;n Gould said you was the cook and steward,&rdquo; she
      observed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I know what a steward is, exactly. Is it the
      one that stews things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; roared Isaiah. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s dignity was hurt. The color rose in
      her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it funny?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I know that a cook cooked
      things, and a baker baked things, so I thought maybe a steward stewed
      &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase continued to chuckle. The girl considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said, with a solemn nod. &ldquo;It was funny, I guess. I remember
      now that a friar doesn&rsquo;t fry things. He is a&mdash;a kind of minister.
      Friar Tuck was one in &lsquo;Robin Hood,&rsquo; you know. Mrs. Bailey read about him
      to me. Do you like &lsquo;Robin Hood,&rsquo; Mr. Chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah said he didn&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late that he knew anybody of that name. The
      dialogue was interrupted here by the arrival of Zoeth and, a moment later,
      Captain Shadrach. Breakfast was put upon the table in the dining-room and
      the quartette sat down to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was quiet during the meal; she answered when spoken to but the
      only questions she asked were concerning David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Captain Shad. &ldquo;Lively as can be. He&rsquo;ll have a good
      time out in that barn; there&rsquo;s considerable many mice out there. Likes
      mice, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. He&rsquo;s a good mouser. Did he look as if he missed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Well, I didn&rsquo;t notice. He never mentioned it if he did. You can go
      see him after breakfast. What do you think she can find to do today,
      Zoeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton had evidently considered the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought maybe she&rsquo;d like to go up to the store &lsquo;long of you and me,&rdquo; he
      suggested. &ldquo;Would you, Mary&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to very much,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I&rsquo;ve got to see to David and the dolls first. Couldn&rsquo;t I come up to
      the store afterwards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain answered. &ldquo;Why, I guess likely you could,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      straight up the road to the corner. You can see the store from the top of
      the hill back here. Isaiah&rsquo;ll show you the way. But you can &lsquo;tend to&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      that cat&rsquo;s name?&mdash;Oh, yes, David&mdash;you can &lsquo;tend to David right
      off. Isaiah&rsquo;ll give the critter his breakfast, and the dolls can wait &lsquo;til
      noontime, can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s mind was evidently divided between inclination and duty.
      Duty won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t dressed yet,&rdquo; she said, gravely. &ldquo;And besides they might think
      I&rsquo;d gone off and left &lsquo;em and be frightened. This is a strange place to
      them, same as it is to me and David, you know. None of us have ever been
      visitin&rsquo; before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was decided that she should wait until her family had been given
      parental attention, and come to the store by herself. The partners left
      for their place of business and she and Mr. Chase remained at the house.
      Her first act, after leaving the table, was to go to the barn and return
      bearing the cat in her arms. David ate a hearty breakfast and then, after
      enduring a motherly lecture concerning prudence and the danger of getting
      lost, was permitted to go out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, standing in the doorway, gazed after her pet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s no dogs around here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It would be dreadful if
      there was a dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah tried to reassure her. &ldquo;Oh, I cal&rsquo;late there ain&rsquo;t no dog nigh
      enough to do any harm,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;besides, most cats can run fast enough
      to get out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child shook her head. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I meant it
      would be dreadful for the dog. David doesn&rsquo;t have a mite of patience with
      dogs. He doesn&rsquo;t wait to see if they&rsquo;re nice ones or not, he just goes for
      &lsquo;em and then&mdash;Oh! He most always goes for &lsquo;em. When he has kittens he
      ALWAYS does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase&rsquo;s reply to this illuminating disclosure was that he wanted to
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;David doesn&rsquo;t take to dogs, some way. Why don&rsquo;t
      cats like dogs, Mr. Chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah said that he cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twas the nature of the critters not to.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta agreed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natures are queer things, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; she said, solemnly. &ldquo;I guess
      everybody has a nature, cats and all. Mrs. Hobbs says my nature is a
      contrary one. What&rsquo;s your kind, Mr. Chase?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; she said, a few moments later, when the cook and steward
      had shown symptoms of doing something beside lean against the sink and
      whistle, &ldquo;do you suppose you could get along for a few minutes while I
      went up and dressed my dolls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah turned to stare at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I&mdash;I cal&rsquo;late maybe I could if I tried hard.
      If you don&rsquo;t beat anything ever I see! What are you doin&rsquo; with that
      pitcher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was holding the wash pitcher under the pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fillin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have to have it on your
      mind any more. I&rsquo;ll hurry back just as fast as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened out, bearing the brimming pitcher with both hands. Isaiah
      gazed after her, muttering a word or two, and then set about clearing the
      breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was down again shortly, the two favorites, Rose and Rosette, in her
      arms. She placed them carefully in the kitchen chair and bade them be nice
      girls and watch mother do the dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left the others in the bedroom,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Minnehaha ain&rsquo;t very
      well this mornin&rsquo;. I guess the excitement was too much for her. She is a
      very nervous child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah&rsquo;s evident amusement caused her to make one of her odd changes from
      childish make-believe to grown-up practicability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added, with gravity, &ldquo;I know she ain&rsquo;t really nervous.
      She&rsquo;s just full of sawdust, same as all dolls are, and she couldn&rsquo;t have
      any nerves. But I like to play she&rsquo;s nervous and delicate. It&rsquo;s real handy
      to say that when I don&rsquo;t want to take her with me. I&rsquo;m a nervous,
      excitable child myself; Mrs. Hobbs says so. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve hardly ever
      been anywhere before, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She insisted upon wiping the dishes while Isaiah washed them. Also, she
      reminded him that the tablecloth which had been so severely criticized the
      previous evening had not as yet been changed. The steward was inclined to
      treat the matter lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind if &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for a spell longer.
      Let it stay. Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the washin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t been done this week
      and there ain&rsquo;t another clean one aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta smiled cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real nice one in the bottom
      drawer of the closet. I&rsquo;ve been huntin&rsquo; and I found it. Come and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him into the dining-room and showed him the cloth she had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real pretty one, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Shall we put it on, Mr.
      Chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, course not. That&rsquo;s the best tablecloth. Don&rsquo;t use that only when
      there&rsquo;s company&mdash;or Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta considered. She counted on her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have we used this dirty one?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Four or five days, maybe.&rdquo; Then, evidently feeling
      that the repetition of the &ldquo;we&rdquo; implied a sense of unwarranted partnership
      in the household management, he added with dignity, &ldquo;That is, I&rsquo;VE seen
      fit to use it that long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sarcasm was wasted. The girl smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes it all right,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If we put this one on now it&rsquo;ll
      be Sunday long before it&rsquo;s time to change. And we can wash the other one
      today or tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, WE can, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked as if he wished to say something but was at a loss for
      words. The Sunday cloth was spread upon the table while he was still
      hunting for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re sure you don&rsquo;t need me any more
      just now I guess I&rsquo;d like to go up and see the store. May I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Site found the store of Hamilton and Company an exceedingly interesting
      place. Zoeth and his partner greeted her cordially and she sat down upon a
      box at the end of the counter and inspected the establishment. It was not
      very large, but there was an amazing variety in its stock. Muslin, tape,
      calico, tacks, groceries, cases of shoes, a rack with spools of thread,
      another containing a few pocket knives, barrels, half a dozen salt codfish
      swinging from nails overhead, some suits of oilskins hanging beside them,
      a tumbled heap of children&rsquo;s caps and hats, even a glass-covered case
      containing boxes of candy with placards &ldquo;1 c. each&rdquo; or &ldquo;3 for 1 c.&rdquo;
       displayed above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like candy, do you?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hamilton, noticing her scrutiny of the
      case and its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about sassafras lozengers? Like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was supplied with a roll of the lozenges and munched them gravely.
      Captain Shad, who had been waiting on a customer, regarded her with an
      amused twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sassafras lozengers are good enough for anybody, eh?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Then she added, politely: &ldquo;Only I guess
      these are wintergreen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stayed at the store until noon. Then she walked home with the Captain
      whose turn it was to dine first that day. The hiring of Annabel had been
      an unusual break in the business routine. Ordinarily but one of the
      partners left that store at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; inquired the Captain, as they walked down the lane, &ldquo;what do you
      think of it? Pretty good store for a place like South Harniss, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you! Different from the Ostable stores, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I&mdash;I guess it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Well, how different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta took her usual interval for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s more&mdash;more things in it with separate smells to
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad had no remark to make for a moment. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, however, was
      anxious to please.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re nice smells,&rdquo; she hastened to add. &ldquo;I like &lsquo;em; only I never
      smelled &lsquo;em all at the same time before. And I like the lozengers VERY
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two or three days which Captain Shad had set as the limit of the
      child&rsquo;s visit passed; as did the next two or three. She was busy and,
      apparently, enjoying herself. She helped Isaiah with the housework, and
      although he found the help not altogether unwelcome, he was inclined to
      grumble a little at what he called her &ldquo;pesterin&rsquo; around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never see such a young-one,&rdquo; he told his employers. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask her to
      do dishes nor fill pitchers nor nothin&rsquo;; she just does it on her own
      hook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Shadrach. &ldquo;So I judged from what I see. Does it
      pretty well, too, don&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Well enough, I guess. Yes,&rdquo; with a burst of candor, &ldquo;for her age,
      she does it mighty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you kickin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t kickin&rsquo;. Who said I was kickin&rsquo;? Only&mdash;well, all I say is
      let her do dishes and such, if she wants to, only&mdash;only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have her heavin&rsquo; out hints about what I ought to
      do. There&rsquo;s two skippers aboard this craft now and that&rsquo;s enough. By
      time!&rdquo; with another burst, &ldquo;that kid&rsquo;s a reg&rsquo;lar born mother. She mothers
      that cat and them dolls and the hens already, and I swan to man I believe
      she&rsquo;d like to adopt me. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be mothered and hinted at to do
      this and that and put to bed and tucked in by no kid. I&rsquo;ll heave up my job
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been on the point of heaving up his job ever since the days when he
      sailed as cook aboard Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s schooner. When the Captain
      retired from the sea for the last time, and became partner and fellow
      shopkeeper with Zoeth, Isaiah had retired with him and was engaged to keep
      house for the two men. The Captain had balked at the idea of a female
      housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women aboard ship are a dum nuisance,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve carried &lsquo;em
      cabin passage and I know. Isaiah Chase is a good cook, and, besides, if
      the biscuits are more fit for cod sinkers than they are for grub, I can
      tell him so in the right kind of language. We don&rsquo;t want no woman steward,
      Zoeth; you hear ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth, although the Captain&rsquo;s seafaring language was a trial to his
      gentle, churchly soul, agreed with his partner on the main point. His
      experience with the other sex had not been such as to warrant further
      experiment. So Isaiah was hired and had been cook and steward at the South
      Harniss home for many years. But he made it a practice to assert his
      independence at frequent intervals, although, as a matter of fact, he
      would no more have dreamed of really leaving than his friends and
      employers would of discharging him. Mr. Chase was as permanent a fixture
      in that house as the ship&rsquo;s chronometer in the dining-room; and that was
      screwed to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in spite of his grumbling, he and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta were rapidly becoming
      fast friends. Shadrach and Zoeth also were beginning to enjoy her company,
      her unexpected questions, her interest in the house and the store, and
      shrewd, old-fashioned comments on persons and things. She was a &ldquo;queer
      young-one&rdquo;; they, like the people of Ostable, agreed on that point, but
      Mr. Hamilton was inclined to think her ways &ldquo;sort of takin&rsquo;&rdquo; and the
      Captain admitted that maybe they were. What he would not admit was that
      the girl&rsquo;s visit, although already prolonged for a fortnight, was anything
      but a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume likely,&rdquo; hinted Zoeth, &ldquo;you and me&rsquo;ll have to give the Judge
      some sort of an answer pretty soon, won&rsquo;t we? He&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; to know
      afore long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know? Know what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why whether we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to say yes or no to what Marcellus
      asked us in that letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does know. Fur&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m consarned, he knows. I spoke my mind plain enough
      to pound through anybody&rsquo;s skull, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I know you did. But, Shadrach, if she don&rsquo;t stay here for
      good where will she stay? She ain&rsquo;t got anybody else to go to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is stayin&rsquo;, ain&rsquo;t she? She&mdash;she&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; us a visit, same as I
      said she could. What more do you want? Jumpin&rsquo; fire! This fix is your
      doin&rsquo; anyway. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t mine. If you had paid attention to what I said, the
      child wouldn&rsquo;t have been here at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Shadrach! You know you was the one that would fetch her over that
      very day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blame it onto me, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t blamin&rsquo; anybody. But she&rsquo;s here and we&rsquo;ve got to decide whether
      to send her away or not. Shall we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by Mary-&rsquo;Gusta herself, who entered the barn, where
      the discussion took place, a doll under one arm and a very serious
      expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; hailed Zoeth. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta seated herself upon an empty cranberry crate. The partners had
      a joint interest in a small cranberry bog and the crate was one of several
      unused the previous fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; the matter,&rdquo; she said, solemnly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo;,
      that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know!&rdquo; observed the Captain. &ldquo;Well, what made you do anything as
      risky as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s forehead puckered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was playin&rsquo; with Jimmie Bacheldor yesterday,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and he made me
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abner Bacheldor was the nearest neighbor. His ramshackle dwelling was an
      eighth of a mile from the Gould-Hamilton place. Abner had the reputation
      of being the meanest man in town; also he had a large family, of which
      Jimmie, eight years old, was the youngest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Captain Shad. &ldquo;So Jimmie Bacheldor made you think, eh? I
      never should have expected it from one of that tribe. How&rsquo;d he do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me about my relations,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;and when I said I
      hadn&rsquo;t got any he was awful surprised. He has ever so many, sisters and
      brothers and aunts and cousins and&mdash;Oh, everything. He thought &lsquo;twas
      dreadful funny my not havin&rsquo; any. I think I&rsquo;d ought to have some, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners, looking rather foolish, said nothing for a moment. Then
      Zoeth muttered that he didn&rsquo;t know but she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;I&mdash;I think so. You see I&rsquo;m&mdash;I mean I
      was a stepchild &lsquo;long as father was here. Now he&rsquo;s dead and I ain&rsquo;t even
      that. And I ain&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s cousin nor nephew nor niece. I just ain&rsquo;t
      anything. I&rsquo;m different from everybody I know. And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; very
      solemnly&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be so different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lip quivered as she said it. Sitting there on the cranberry crate,
      hugging her dolls, she was a pathetic little figure. Again the partners
      found it hard to answer. Mr. Hamilton looked at the Captain and the
      latter, his fingers fidgeting with his watchchain, avoided the look. The
      girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how nice &lsquo;twould have been if I&rsquo;d had a&mdash;a
      brother or somebody of my very own. I&rsquo;ve got children, of course, but
      they&rsquo;re only dolls and a cat. They&rsquo;re nice, but they ain&rsquo;t real folks. I
      wish I had some real folks. Do you suppose if&mdash;if I have to go to the&mdash;the
      orphans&rsquo; home, there&rsquo;d be anybody there that would be my relation? I
      didn&rsquo;t know but there might be another orphan there who didn&rsquo;t have
      anybody, same as me, and then we could make believe we was&mdash;was
      cousins or somethin&rsquo;. That would be better than nothin&rsquo;, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth stepped forward and, bending over, kissed her cheek. &ldquo;Never you
      mind, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t gone there yet and afore you do
      maybe Cap&rsquo;n Shad and I can think up some relations for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real relations?&rdquo; asked Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not real ones; I&rsquo;m afraid we couldn&rsquo;t do that. But when it
      comes to make-believe, that might be different.&rdquo; He hesitated an instant,
      glanced at the Captain, and then added: &ldquo;I tell you what you do: you just
      pretend I&rsquo;m your relation, a&mdash;well, an uncle, that&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n
      nothin&rsquo;. You just call me &lsquo;Uncle Zoeth.&rsquo; That&rsquo;ll be a start, anyhow. Think
      you&rsquo;d like to call me &lsquo;Uncle Zoeth&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Then I could tell that
      Jimmie Bacheldor I had one relation, anyhow. And shall I call Cap&rsquo;n Gould
      &lsquo;Uncle Shadrach&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth turned to his companion. &ldquo;Shall she, Shadrach?&rdquo; he asked, with a
      mischievous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for that smile the Captain&rsquo;s reply might have been
      different. But the smile irritated him. He strode to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth Hamilton,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;how long are you goin&rsquo; to set here? If you
      ain&rsquo;t got anything else to attend to, I have. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up to the store.
      It&rsquo;s pretty nigh eight o&rsquo;clock in the mornin&rsquo; and that store ain&rsquo;t open
      yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to come along, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo; asked Zoeth. &ldquo;She can come, can&rsquo;t she,
      Shad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, course she can,&rdquo; more genially. &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late there&rsquo;s some of those
      sassafras&mdash;checkerberry lozengers left yet. Come on, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, if
      you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the child shook her head. She looked wistful and a trifle
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess maybe I&rsquo;d better stay here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I ought to see to
      Minnehaha&rsquo;s sore throat. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put some red flannel &lsquo;round it; Mr.
      Chase says he cal&rsquo;lates he knows where there is some. Good-by, Uncle
      Zoeth. Good-by&mdash;er&mdash;Cap&rsquo;n Gould.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners did not converse on the way to the store. Zoeth made an
      attempt, but Shadrach refused to answer. He was silent and, for him,
      grumpy all the forenoon. Another fortnight passed before the subject of
      the decision which must, sooner or later, be given Judge Baxter was
      mentioned by either of the pair.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was growing accustomed to the life in the South Harniss home.
      She found it a great improvement over that which she had known on
      Phinney&rsquo;s Hill at Ostable. There was no Mrs. Hobbs to nag and find fault,
      there were no lonely meals, no scoldings when stockings were torn or face
      and hands soiled. And as a playground the beach was a wonderland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Jimmie Bacheldor picked up shells, built sand forts, skipped flat
      stones along the surface of the water at high tide, and picked up scallops
      and an occasional quahaug at low water. Jimmie was, generally speaking, a
      satisfactory playmate, although he usually insisted upon having his own
      way and, when they got into trouble because of this insistence, did not
      permit adherence to the truth to obstruct the path to a complete alibi.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, who had been taught by the beloved Mrs. Bailey to consider
      lying a deadly sin, regarded her companion&rsquo;s lapses with alarmed
      disapproval, but she was too loyal to contradict and more than once
      endured reproof when the fault was not hers. She had had few playmates in
      her short life and this one, though far from perfect, was a joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They explored the house together and found in the big attic and the
      stuffy, shut-up best parlor the most fascinating of treasure hordes. The
      former, with its rows of old trunks and sea chests under the low eaves,
      the queer garments and discarded hats hanging on the nails, the dusky
      corners where the light from the little windows scarcely penetrated even
      on a sunny May afternoon, was the girl&rsquo;s especial Paradise. Here she came
      to play by herself on rainy days or when she did not care for company. Her
      love of make-believe and romance had free scope here and with no Jimmie to
      laugh and make fun of her imaginings she pretended to her heart&rsquo;s content.
      Different parts of that garret gradually, in her mind, came to have names
      of their own. In the bright spot, under the north window, was Home, where
      she and the dolls and David&mdash;when the cat could be coaxed from
      prowlings and mouse hunts to quiet and slumber&mdash;lived and dined and
      entertained and were ill or well or happy or frightened, according to the
      day&rsquo;s imaginative happenings. Sometimes Home was a castle, sometimes a
      Swiss Family Robinson cave, sometimes a store which transacted business
      after the fashion of Hamilton and Company. And in other more or less fixed
      spots and corners were Europe, to which the family voyaged occasionally;
      Niagara Falls&mdash;Mrs. Bailey&rsquo;s honeymoon had been spent at the real
      Niagara; the King&rsquo;s palace; the den of the wicked witch; Sherwood Forest;
      and Jordan, Marsh and Company&rsquo;s store in Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie Bacheldor liked the garret well enough, but imagination was not his
      strongest quality and the best parlor had more charms for him. In that
      parlor were the trophies of Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s seafaring days&mdash;whales&rsquo; 
      teeth, polished and with pictures of ships upon them; the model of a
      Chinese junk; a sea-turtle shell, flippers, head and all, exactly like a
      real turtle except, as Mary-&rsquo;Gusta said, &lsquo;it didn&rsquo;t have any works&rsquo;; a
      glass bottle with a model of the bark Treasure Seeker inside; an Eskimo
      lance with a bone handle and an ivory point; a cocoanut carved to look
      like the head and face of a funny old man; a Cuban machete; and a set of
      ivory chessmen with Chinese knights and kings and queens, all complete and
      set out under a glass cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      The junk and the lance and the machete and the rest had a fascination for
      Jimmie, as they would have had for most boys, but for him the parlor&rsquo;s
      strongest temptation lay in the fact that the children were forbidden to
      play there. Zoeth and the Captain, having been brought up in New England
      families of the old-fashioned kind, revered their parlor as a place too
      precious for use. They, themselves, entered it not oftener than three
      times a year, and Isaiah went there only when he felt inclined to dust,
      which was not often. Shadrach had exhibited its treasures to the children
      one Sunday morning when Zoeth was at church, but he cautioned them against
      going there by themselves. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be liable to break somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he told
      them, &ldquo;and some of them things in there you couldn&rsquo;t buy with money.
      They&rsquo;ve been brought from pretty much everywheres in creation, those
      things have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of the warning, or because of it, Jimmie was, as Isaiah
      would have said, &ldquo;possessed&rdquo; to visit that parlor. He coaxed and teased
      and dared Mary-&rsquo;Gusta to take advantage of the steward&rsquo;s stepping out of
      the house or being busy in the kitchen to open that parlor door and go in
      with him and peep at and handle the treasures. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta protested, but
      young Bacheldor called her a coward and declared he wouldn&rsquo;t play with
      cowards and &lsquo;fraid-cats, so rather than be one of those detestable
      creatures she usually swallowed her scruples and followed the tempter. It
      was a risk, of course, but a real adventure; and, like many adventurers,
      the pair came to grief. They took David into the parlor and the cat
      wriggled from its owner&rsquo;s arms, jumped upon the table, knocked the case
      containing the chessmen to the floor, and not only broke the glass but
      decapitated one of the white knights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the mild Mr. Hamilton was incensed when Isaiah told the news at
      supper time. And Captain Shad, who had bought those chessmen at Singapore
      from the savings of a second mate&rsquo;s wages, lost patience entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you young-ones not to go into that parlor?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; admitted Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by fire, I did! And you went just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you fetched that everlastin&rsquo;&mdash;er&mdash;Goliath in there, too.
      Don&rsquo;t you know you&rsquo;ve been a bad girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth protested. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t a bad girl, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know she
      ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;maybe she ain&rsquo;t, generally speakin&rsquo;. I cal&rsquo;late &lsquo;twas
      that Bacheldor brat that was responsible; but just the same I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; 
      to have it happen any more. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, if you and that consarned&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;Jimmie&mdash;go
      into that parlor again, unless Isaiah or one of us are with you, I&mdash;I&mdash;by
      the jumpin&rsquo; Judas, me and Zoeth won&rsquo;t let you go to the Sunday school
      picnic. There! I mean that and so does Zoeth. Shut up, Zoeth! You do mean
      it, too. You know mighty well either your dad or mine would have skinned
      us alive if we&rsquo;d done such a thing when we was young-ones. And,&rdquo; turning
      to the culprit, &ldquo;if you fetch that cat in there, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday school picnic was to be held on the second Saturday in June and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta wished to attend it. She had never been to a real picnic,
      though the other children in Ostable had described such outings in glowing
      colors. Now, although she, a visitor, was not a regular member of the
      South Harniss Methodist Sunday school, the superintendent personally had
      invited her to go and Zoeth and the Captain had given their consent. Not
      to go would be a heart-breaking calamity. She finally resolved to be very,
      very good and obedient from that time on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But good resolutions are broken occasionally, even by grown-ups, and in
      childhood much can be forgotten in nine days. So, on the afternoon of the
      tenth day, which was the day before the picnic, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta walking alone
      in the field which separated the Gould-Hamilton property from that of
      Abner Bacheldor, Jimmie&rsquo;s father&mdash;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, walking in that field,
      was depressed and melancholy. Her state of mind was indicated by the fact
      that she had left all her dolls, even Rose and Rosette, at home. She felt
      guilty and wicked and conscience-stricken. She had been a bad girl; only
      one other knew how bad she had been and he, being guilty likewise, would
      not betray her. But at home Isaiah Chase was, as he said, &ldquo;heatin&rsquo; himself
      to a bile&rdquo; baking apple turnovers for her to take to the picnic. And
      Captain Shadrach had announced his intention of bringing her, from the
      store, candy and bananas to go into the lunch basket with the turnovers
      and sandwiches and cake. And the Captain had that very day called her a
      good girl. If he only knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a flurry of excitement in the kitchen just after dinner.
      Mr. Bacheldor had appeared at the door with the request that he might
      &ldquo;borrer the loan of Cap&rsquo;n Gould&rsquo;s shotgun.&rdquo; The day before, at a quarter
      after four&mdash;Mr. Bacheldor was certain as to the time because he had
      been &ldquo;layin&rsquo; down two or three minutes on the sofy afore goin&rsquo; out to look
      at some wood there was to cut in the shed, and I&rsquo;d just got up and looked
      at the clock afore I looked out of the settin&rsquo;-room winder&rdquo;&mdash;looking
      out of that window he had seen a cat running from his henyard with one of
      his recently hatched Plymouth Rock chickens in its mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d had a gun then,&rdquo; declared Abner, &ldquo;I could have blowed the critter
      to thunder-and-gone. But I&rsquo;ll get him next time. Let me have the gun, will
      you, Isaiah? I know Shad&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s all right when you tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That shotgun was a precious arm. It had been given to the Captain years
      before by the officers of a sinking schooner, whom Shadrach&rsquo;s boat&rsquo;s crew,
      led by Shadrach himself, had rescued at a big risk off the Great South
      School. It had the Captain&rsquo;s name, with an inscription and date, on a
      silver plate fastened to the stock. Isaiah was not too willing to lend it,
      but chicken stealing is a capital offense in South Harniss, as it is in
      most rural communities, and the cat caught in the act is summarily
      executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Chase went to the Captain&rsquo;s room and returned with the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you be, Ab,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hope you get the critter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll get him all right, don&rsquo;t you fret. Say, Isaiah&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
       Mr. Bacheldor hesitated. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t let me have two
      or three cartridges, could you? I ain&rsquo;t got none in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked more doubtful than ever, but he brought the cartridges.
      After making sure, by inquiry and inspection, that they were loaded, the
      borrower started to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I say, Ab,&rdquo; Mr. Chase called after him; &ldquo;know whose cat &lsquo;twas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bacheldor did not appear to hear, so the question was repeated. Abner
      answered without turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I know all right,&rdquo; and hurried on. Isaiah looked
      after him and sniffed disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody on earth but that feller,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would have been ashamed to
      beg cartridges after beggin&rsquo; the gun, but not Ab Bacheldor, no sir! Wonder
      he didn&rsquo;t want to borrer my Sunday hat to practice shootin&rsquo; at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta considered shooting a cat the height of cruelty and
      dreadfulness but she was aware of the universal condemnation of chicken
      stealing and kept her thought to herself. Besides, she had her own
      wickedness to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked slowly on across the field, bound nowhere in particular,
      thinking hard and feeling very wretched and miserable. The pleasure of the
      next day, the day she had been anticipating, was spoiled already for her.
      If she went to that picnic without making a full and free confession she
      knew she would feel as mean and miserable as she was feeling now. And if
      she did confess, why then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her meditations were interrupted in a startling manner. She was midway of
      the field, upon the other side of which was a tumbledown stone wall, and a
      cluster of wild cherry trees and bayberry bushes marking the boundary of
      the Bacheldor land. From behind the wall and bushes sounded the loud
      report of a gun; then the tramp of running feet and an excited shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You missed him,&rdquo; screamed a voice. &ldquo;You never hit him at all. There he
      goes! There he goes! Give him t&rsquo;other barrel quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, who had been startled nearly out of her senses by the shot
      and the shouting, stood perfectly still, too surprised and frightened even
      to run. And then out of the bushes before her darted a scared
      tortoise-shell cat, frantically rushing in her direction. The cat was
      David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s hidin&rsquo; in them bushes,&rdquo; shouted the voice again. &ldquo;Stay where you be,
      Pop. I&rsquo;ll scare him out and then you give it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta stood still no longer. The sight of her idolized pet running
      for his life was enough to make her forget fright and everything else. She
      too ran, but not toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Oh, David! Come here! David!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      David may have recognized the voice, but if so the recognition made no
      difference. The cat kept straight on. The girl ran across its path. It
      dodged and darted into a beachplum thicket, a cul-de-sac of tangled
      branches and thick grass. Before the animal could extricate itself
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had seized it in her arms. It struggled and fought for freedom
      but the child held it tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, David! Please be still! They shan&rsquo;t hurt
      you; I won&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the bushes above the wall appeared the freckled face of Con&mdash;christened
      Cornelius&mdash;Bacheldor. Con was Jimmie&rsquo;s elder brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have got through,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;He&mdash;no, there he is. She&rsquo;s
      got him, Pop. Make her put him down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abner Bacheldor crashed through to his son&rsquo;s side. He was carrying a
      gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put that cat down,&rdquo; screamed Con, threateningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta said nothing. Her heart was beating wildly but she held the
      struggling David fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that kid over to Shad Gould&rsquo;s,&rdquo; declared Con. &ldquo;Make her give you a
      shot, Pop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Abner Bacheldor took command of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Fetch that critter here. I want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not answer. She was pale and her small knees shook,
      but she neither spoke nor moved from where she stood. And her grip upon
      the cat tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch that cat here,&rdquo; repeated Abner. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to shoot him; he&rsquo;s
      been stealin&rsquo; our chickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this accusation and the awful threat accompanying it, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      forgot her terror of the Bacheldors, of the gun, forgot everything except
      her pet and its danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried frantically. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t! He ain&rsquo;t! He&rsquo;s my cat and he
      don&rsquo;t steal chickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does, too,&rdquo; roared Con. &ldquo;Pop and I see him doin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t believe it! When did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon. We see him, didn&rsquo;t we, Pop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your life we did,&rdquo; growled Abner. &ldquo;And he was on my land again
      just now; comin&rsquo; to steal more, I cal&rsquo;late. Fetch him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I shan&rsquo;t! He shan&rsquo;t be shot, even if he did steal &lsquo;em. And I know
      he didn&rsquo;t. If you shoot him I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell Uncle Zoeth and&mdash;and
      Cap&rsquo;n Gould. And I won&rsquo;t let you have him anyhow. I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; with savage
      defiance. &ldquo;If you shoot him you&rsquo;ll have to shoot me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Con climbed over the wall. &ldquo;You just wait, Pop,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him
      away from her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his father hesitated. There were certain reasons why he thought it
      best not to be too arbitrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Con,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look here, sis, I&rsquo;m sorry to have to kill your
      cat, but I&rsquo;ve got to. He steals chickens and them kind of cats has to be
      shot. I see him myself yesterday afternoon. I told Isaiah Chase myself
      that . . . why, you was there and heard me! You heard me tell how I was
      lookin&rsquo; out of the winder at quartet past four and see that cat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta interrupted. Her expression changed. She was still dreadfully
      frightened but in her tone was a note of relief, of confident triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t David; it wasn&rsquo;t this cat you
      saw. I KNOW it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know it was. Now don&rsquo;t argue no more. You fetch that cat here or
      I&rsquo;ll have Con take him away from you. Hurry up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it wasn&rsquo;t David,&rdquo; began Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Then, as Con started in her
      direction, she turned and ran, ran as hard as she could, bearing David in
      her arms. Con ran after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the cat that saved the situation and its life at the same time.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was near the edge of the pine grove and Con was close at her
      heels. David gave one more convulsive, desperate wriggle, slid from the
      girl&rsquo;s arms and disappeared through the pines like a gray projectile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta collapsed on the grass and burst into frightened, hysterical
      sobs. Con took one or two steps after the flying cat and gave up the
      chase. Mr. Bacheldor, from behind the wall, swore emphatically and at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Con, you fool,&rdquo; he yelled, when the expression of his true
      feelings had reached a temporary end. &ldquo;Come here! let the kid alone. We&rsquo;ll
      get into trouble if we don&rsquo;t. As for that dummed cat, we&rsquo;ll get him next
      time. He&rsquo;ll see his finish. Come on, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Con reluctantly rejoined his parent and the pair departed, muttering
      threats. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, the tears running down her cheeks, ran home to find
      David and plead with Mr. Chase for her pet&rsquo;s safety and protection from
      its persecutors. But Isaiah had gone up to the store on an errand. David,
      however, was crouching, a trembling heap, under the kitchen stove. The
      girl pulled him out, fled with him to the garret, and there, with the door
      locked, sat shivering and sobbing until Captain Shad came home for supper
      that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s first question when he arrived was concerning Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s
      whereabouts. Isaiah said he had not seen her for two hours or more. And
      just then the child herself appeared, entering the kitchen from the door
      leading to the back stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta!&rdquo; hailed Shadrach. &ldquo;Thought you was lost. Supper&rsquo;s
      about ready to put on the table. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter? Been cryin&rsquo;,
      ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta went straight to him and clutched his hand. &ldquo;Please, Cap&rsquo;n
      Gould,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;will you come into the sittin&rsquo;-room a minute? I&mdash;I
      want to ask you somethin&rsquo;. I want you to do somethin&rsquo; for me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin sure I will. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta glanced at Isaiah&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather tell you, just
      you alone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please come into the sittin&rsquo;-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tugged at his hand. Much puzzled, he followed her through the
      dining-room and into the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, kindly, &ldquo;now what is it? What&rsquo;s the big
      secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta closed the door. She was very solemn and her lip quivered but
      she did not hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about David,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s happened to David. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; to tell you about it, Cap&rsquo;n Gould.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She told of her adventure and of David&rsquo;s peril. Shadrach listened. When he
      heard of the accusation which was the cause of the affair he shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty bad, that is. I&rsquo;d hate to have your
      cat killed, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, land knows I would. But if the critter&rsquo;s a
      chicken thief&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he ain&rsquo;t! I KNOW he ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You can&rsquo;t always tell, you know cats are cats and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know David wasn&rsquo;t the cat that did it. I KNOW he wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know, do you. Hm! you do seem pretty sartin, that&rsquo;s a fact. How
      do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at him. &ldquo;Please, Cap&rsquo;n Gould,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d
      rather tell you over to Mr. Bacheldor&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s what I wanted to ask you;
      won&rsquo;t you please go right over to Mr. Bacheldor&rsquo;s with me? I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you how I know when we&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach was more puzzled than ever. &ldquo;You want me to go to Ab
      Bacheldor&rsquo;s with you?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You want to tell me somethin&rsquo; over
      there? Why not tell me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause Mr. Bacheldor thinks David did it and he&rsquo;ll kill him.
      He said he would. I want HIM to know David wasn&rsquo;t the one. And if, if
      you&rsquo;re there when he knows, he&rsquo;ll know YOU know he knows and he won&rsquo;t dast
      shoot at David any more. Please come, Cap&rsquo;n Gould. Please, right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach tugged at his beard. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more &lsquo;knows&rsquo; 
      in that than there is knots in a snarled fish line. You want me as a
      witness, nigh&rsquo;s I can make out. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Will you go with me right off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right off, eh? Can&rsquo;t it wait till after supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want any supper. PLEASE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So supper was postponed, in spite of Isaiah&rsquo;s grumblings, and the Captain
      and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta started forthwith for the home of their nearest neighbor.
      Mr. Chase, his curiosity aroused, would have asked a dozen questions, but
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta would neither answer nor permit Shadrach to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bacheldor family were at supper when the callers arrived. Abner
      himself opened the door and he looked rather embarrassed when he saw the
      pair on the steps. Captain Shad did not wait for an invitation to enter;
      he walked in and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Ab,&rdquo; said the Captain, briskly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this about our cat
      stealin&rsquo; your chickens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bacheldor and Con, separately and together, burst into a tirade of
      invective against the offending David.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; broke in the Captain, crisply. &ldquo;If
      that cat stole your chicken it ought to be shot. But are you sure of the
      cat? Do you know ours did it? This girl here says &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t ours at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know a dum sight better,&rdquo; began Abner, savagely. But this time it was
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta who interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Gould,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please ask him what time it was yesterday
      afternoon when he saw the cat run off with the chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bacheldor did not wait to be asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas quarter-past four yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I know the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what the time&rsquo;s got to do with it,&rdquo; put in Shadrach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s got everything to do with it,&rdquo; urged Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;Honest truly
      it has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it has, eh? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause&mdash;Ask him if he&rsquo;s sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Abner did not wait. &ldquo;Course I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I told Isaiah
      Chase&mdash;yes, and I told that young-one, too&mdash;that I looked at the
      clock just afore I looked out of the window and see the critter in the
      very act. Yes, and Con see him too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta stamped her foot in triumph. &ldquo;Then it wasn&rsquo;t David,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t David at all. &lsquo;Twas somebody else&rsquo;s cat, Mr. Bacheldor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody else&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;! Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Heave to, Ab. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, how do you know &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t our cat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause David was with me from four o&rsquo;clock till most five;
      that&rsquo;s how. He was in the&mdash;in our house with me. So,&rdquo; triumphantly,
      &ldquo;he couldn&rsquo;t have been anywhere else, could he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Con and his father both began a protest, but Shadrach cut it short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still, for mercy sakes,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t Shoutin&rsquo; Methodist
      camp meetin&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s get soundin&rsquo;s here. Now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, you say the cat
      was with you from four till five; you&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I know because Mr. Chase had gone out and we knew he wouldn&rsquo;t
      be back until five &lsquo;cause he said he wouldn&rsquo;t. So we looked at the clock
      before we went in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went in? Went in where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hung her head. It was evident that the answer to this question
      was one she dreaded to make. But she made it, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we went into&mdash;into the parlor,&rdquo; she said, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad was the only one of her hearers who grasped the full
      significance of this confession. No, there was one other, and he turned
      red and then white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parlor?&rdquo; repeated the Captain, slowly. &ldquo;The best parlor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you went into the best parlor over to our house and&mdash;AND
      TOOK THAT CAT IN WITH YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan to man! Did you forget what I told you would happen if you
      went into that parlor again? And especially if you lugged that cat in? Did
      you forget that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, sir. I didn&rsquo;t forget it. You&mdash;you said I couldn&rsquo;t go to the
      picnic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;if this don&rsquo;t beat the
      nation! What under the sun did you do it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause we wanted to play pirates with&mdash;with the swords
      and things,&rdquo; faltered Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;And we took David &lsquo;cause he was goin&rsquo; 
      to be one of the passengers on the ship we took. But,&rdquo; with a sudden
      return to the main point at issue, &ldquo;that proves David wasn&rsquo;t the cat he
      saw, the one that stole his chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked at her. &ldquo;By fire, it does, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he muttered.
      Abner Bacheldor roared in indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t prove nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;All it proves is that the kid&rsquo;s a
      liar. She&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; so&rsquo;s to save that dummed thief of a cat. All kids&rsquo;ll lie
      when they think they can make somethin&rsquo; out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach grunted. &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t caught this one in a
      lie so far. And I doubt if she&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; now. Now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, is there any
      way you can prove you was in that parlor, and&mdash;what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;David
      was there at the time you say? Is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hesitated. Her eyes wandered about the faces in the
      room, until their gaze rested upon the face of Jimmie Bacheldor. And
      Jimmie looked white and scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, sir, I&mdash;I guess not,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not, too,&rdquo; declared Con, with a sarcastic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain was suspicious. He had seen the child&rsquo;s look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to this than a blind man could see
      through a board fence. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, was there anybody else except David in
      that parlor along with you? Was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta looked at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? I kind of had an idea there might be. Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the look and then: &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Con laughed once more. &ldquo;You bet she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t. The
      whole yarn&rsquo;s a lie. Don&rsquo;t pay no attention to it, Pop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach turned sharply in his direction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;M payin&rsquo; attention to it,&rdquo; he
      snapped, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s enough. So you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to tell, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, eh?
      Remember now, if you do tell it&rsquo;ll prove your story&rsquo;s true and David&rsquo;ll
      come out on top. Think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was thinking it over. Her eyes filled with tears,
      but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked down at her. &ldquo;Keepin&rsquo; mum, eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s
      all right. I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;re pretty good guessers, some of us, anyway.
      Jim,&rdquo; with a sudden look straight at the youngest member of his neighbor&rsquo;s
      family, who was fidgeting with his spoon and acting remarkably nervous,
      &ldquo;what have you got to say? Have a good time in that parlor playin&rsquo; 
      pirates, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie gasped. The suddenness of the attack knocked his defenses flat. He
      gurgled, stammered, and then broke into a wail of distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; he sobbed, wildly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas her. She said do it;
      I never. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Jimmie Bacheldor!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, shocked into protest by
      her fellow culprit&rsquo;s distortion of the truth. &ldquo;How can you say so! What a
      story! You know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he knows,&rdquo; broke in Shadrach. &ldquo;And I cal&rsquo;late I know, too. Now
      then, Jim, what time was it when you looked at the clock? Shut up, Abner,
      let the boy answer. Tell us, Jim; nobody&rsquo;ll hurt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it was four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; hollered Jimmie, in agony. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      never done it a purpose. I won&rsquo;t do so no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late you will. Cal&rsquo;late you won&rsquo;t have a chance. Well,
      Ab, I guess we&rsquo;ve proved our client&rsquo;s case. Next time you go out cat
      shootin&rsquo; you better be sure you&rsquo;re gunnin&rsquo; for the right one. Come on,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Con Bacheldor sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pop,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;be you goin&rsquo; to let &lsquo;em go this way? And that cat
      stealin&rsquo; our chickens right along. Ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to tell &lsquo;em you&rsquo;ll kill
      the critter next time he comes on our land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abner was silent. He seemed oddly anxious to see the last of his visitors.
      It was the Captain who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Con,&rdquo; he said, crisply, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to tell me that. And you
      listen while I tell YOU somethin&rsquo;. If that cat of ours gets hurt or don&rsquo;t
      show up some time I&rsquo;ll know who&rsquo;s responsible. And then&mdash;well, then
      maybe I&rsquo;LL go gunnin&rsquo;. Good night, all hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the way back across the fields and through the grove the Captain was
      silent. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta clinging to his hand was silent too, dreading what she
      knew was sure to follow. When they entered the kitchen Shadrach turned to
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your cat&rsquo;s turned out to be no
      chicken thief, but&mdash;but that don&rsquo;t alter what you did, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; stammered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid it don&rsquo;t. I told you what would happen if you went into
      that parlor, and you went just the same. I cal&rsquo;late you know what to
      expect, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes, sir,&rdquo; in a low tone. &ldquo;You mean I can&rsquo;t go to the Sunday school
      picnic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach cleared his throat. He was not enjoying this episode, as a matter
      of fact his unhappiness was almost as keen as the child&rsquo;s. But as a boy he
      had been reared in the old-fashioned way, and he felt that he had a duty
      to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;Now set down and have
      your supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta tried hard to be brave, but the disappointment was too great.
      The tears streamed down her cheeks and she ran from the room. Shadrach
      strode after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, where are you goin&rsquo;? Come back and have
      your supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not come back. She was already on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want any supper,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Please, oh, PLEASE don&rsquo;t
      make me eat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain hesitated, turned back, and jerked his own chair to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he demanded brusquely, &ldquo;the supper&rsquo;s here and somebody&rsquo;s got to
      eat it, I cal&rsquo;late. Fetch it on, Isaiah! What are you starin&rsquo; at me like
      that for, you dumbhead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah brought in the supper. Then he demanded to know what the fuss was
      all about. Shadrach told him. Isaiah&rsquo;s chief interest seemed to center on
      the attempted shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the son of a swab!&rdquo; he cried, excitedly. &ldquo;Of all the cheek I ever
      heard of in my life that Abner Bacheldor&rsquo;s got the heft! To borrer a man&rsquo;s
      own gun&mdash;yes, and cartridges, too&mdash;to kill that man&rsquo;s own cat
      with! Of all the solid brass! He never told me &lsquo;twas our cat. All he
      wanted to know was could he borrer your gun and somethin&rsquo; to load it with.
      If I&rsquo;d known&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His employer interrupted him. &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that
      Ab Bacheldor came here and borrowed MY gun to&mdash;to do what he done
      with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin sure he did. And only this very afternoon, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he know whose cat &lsquo;twas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he did. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was here &lsquo;long with me when he come. I says:
      &lsquo;Know whose cat &lsquo;tis?&rsquo; and says he, &lsquo;I know all right!&rsquo; I thought he acted
      kind of sheepish and funny. I&mdash;Here! where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was on his feet and his cap was in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make another call on Abner. And,&rdquo; with
      his hand on the latch, &ldquo;if you hear somebody bein&rsquo; murdered over in that
      direction you needn&rsquo;t call the constable, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but, hold on, Cap&rsquo;n Shad! You ain&rsquo;t finished your own supper
      yet and Zoeth&rsquo;s waiting up to the store for you to come back so&rsquo;s he can
      come down and get his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reply was emphatic and, in its way, conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the blue brimstone with the supper!&rdquo; roared Shadrach. &ldquo;It can wait and
      so can Zoeth. If he can&rsquo;t he can do the next best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was absent for half an hour. When he returned Mr. Hamilton was in the
      dining-room. Shadrach entered, bearing the precious shotgun. He stood it
      carefully in the corner. There was a satisfied look in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Shadrach!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoeth, &ldquo;what have you been
      thinkin&rsquo; of? There I was waitin&rsquo; and waitin&rsquo; and hankerin&rsquo; and hankerin&rsquo; 
      and no you nor no supper. I had to lock up the store finally. &lsquo;Twas either
      that or starve. I ain&rsquo;t a fault-finder, generally speakin&rsquo;, but I have to
      eat, same as other folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His partner paid not the least attention. His first remark was in the form
      of a question addressed to Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Isaiah,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;did I understand you to say that
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was with you when that sculpin come to borrow my gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. She was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she knew that he was goin&rsquo; to shoot a cat with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, she heard him say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach strode to the mantel, took from it a hand-lamp, lighted the lamp
      and with it in his hand walked from the room and ascended the stairs.
      Zoeth called after him, but he did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s room. The child was in bed, the dolls beside her.
      She was not asleep, however. The tear stains on her cheeks and the
      dampness of the pillow showed how she had spent the time since leaving the
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach put the lamp upon the washstand, pulled a chair beside the bed
      and sat down. He took her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;you knew &lsquo;twas my gun that Ab Bacheldor
      was tryin&rsquo; to shoot David with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta moved her head up and down on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was here when he borrowed it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And then I knew it was yours when he had it there in the field.
      I saw the silver name thing on the handle. It kind of shined in the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Yes, yes. I see. You knew it, of course. But you didn&rsquo;t tell me.
      Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you? Didn&rsquo;t you know that if I&rsquo;d realized that swab
      had borrered my gun to kill my cat that would have been enough? If the
      critter had stole a million chickens &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference
      if I&rsquo;d known THAT. The cheeky lubber! Well, he won&rsquo;t shoot at anything of
      ours for one spell, I&rsquo;ll bet. But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s answer was promptly given.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &lsquo;cause,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that was just it. I knew if you knew that you
      wouldn&rsquo;t care whether David stole the chicken or not. And I wanted you to
      know he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um, I see. But if you had told me you wouldn&rsquo;t have had to tell about the
      parlor. I&rsquo;D never asked a single question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-yes, sir; but I wanted you to know David doesn&rsquo;t steal chickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach swallowed hard. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I see. So just to
      clear that cat you was willin&rsquo; to give up the picnic and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta sobbed: &ldquo;I&mdash;I did want to go so,&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain lifted her from the pillow and put his arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he declared, emphatically, &ldquo;you just bet you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh, am I? Am I really? I&mdash;I know I hadn&rsquo;t ought to. I was a bad
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! You&rsquo;re a dummed good girl! The best and squarest&mdash;yes, and the
      spunkiest little girl I ever saw. You&rsquo;re a brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful sorry I went into the parlor, Cap&rsquo;n Gould.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blast the parlor! I don&rsquo;t care if you stay in there a week and smash
      everything in it. And&mdash;and, see here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, don&rsquo;t you call me
      &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n Gould&rsquo; any more. Call me &lsquo;Uncle Shad,&rsquo; will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just before bedtime that night Mr. Hamilton broached a subject which had
      troubled him all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, timidly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I ought to tell you
      somethin&rsquo;. I know you won&rsquo;t want to talk about it, but seems &lsquo;s if I must
      tell you. I had a letter this morning from Judge Baxter. He says he can&rsquo;t
      wait much longer for an answer from us about Marcellus&rsquo;s girl. He&rsquo;s got to
      know what we&rsquo;ve decided to do with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach, who was smoking, took his pipe from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, give him the answer then,&rdquo; he said, shortly. &ldquo;You know what &lsquo;tis,
      well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t want to keep her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Why, Shadrach Gould! You said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said a good many things maybe; but that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. You knew what I
      meant as well as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Shadrach! You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mean you ARE willin&rsquo; to keep her&mdash;here,
      with us, for good? You don&rsquo;t mean THAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain snorted impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so foolish, Zoeth,&rdquo; he
      protested. &ldquo;You knew plaguey well I never meant anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day Captain Shadrach drove to Ostable and spent several hours in
      consultation with Judge Baxter. Adjusting matters by correspondence is a
      slow process at best, and the Captain, having surrendered unconditionally,
      was not the man to delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can settle more in ten minutes&rsquo; talk,&rdquo; he told his partner, &ldquo;than the
      three of us could in a month&rsquo;s letter-writin&rsquo;, especially if I had to
      write any of the letters. I never was any hand to write letters; you know
      that, Zoeth. And when I do write one the feller I send it to is liable to
      come around and ask me to read it &lsquo;cause he can&rsquo;t. Like as not I can&rsquo;t
      either, if it&rsquo;s had time to get cold, and there we are, right where we
      started. No, I&rsquo;ll go and see the Judge and when I fetch port tonight
      there&rsquo;ll have been somethin&rsquo; done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This prophecy was fulfilled. Before the Captain left Ostable for the
      homeward drive a good deal had been done. Judge Baxter, in his capacity as
      administrator, had already been looking into the affairs of his late
      client and, as he had expected, those affairs were badly tangled. When the
      outstanding debts were paid there would be little left, a thousand or two,
      perhaps, but certainly no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there you are, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad you and Zoeth have
      decided to keep the girl, but I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll come to you with very
      little property of her own. If she is to have the good education and all
      the rest that Marcellus wanted her to have I guess it&rsquo;ll be your money
      that pays for it. That&rsquo;s the honest truth, and I think you ought to know
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expected just about
      that, account of what you said the day of the funeral. Me and Zoeth are
      about, as fur from bein&rsquo; rich as the ship&rsquo;s cat is from bein&rsquo; skipper, but
      we&rsquo;ve put by a little and the store fetches us in a decent livin&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ll
      take the young-one and do our best by her. Land knows what that best&rsquo;ll
      be,&rdquo; he added, with a dubious shake of the head. &ldquo;Speakin&rsquo; for myself, I
      feel that I&rsquo;m about as competent to bring up a child as a clam is to fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baxter laughed. &ldquo;Marcellus seemed confident that you and Hamilton were
      perfectly suited to the job,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um; yes, I know; Marcellus had confidence in a good many things, the
      stock market included. However, what is to be will be and we all have to
      take chances, as the feller that was just married said when he tackled his
      wife&rsquo;s first mince pie. You get those guardian papers, whatever they are,
      made out, and Zoeth and me&rsquo;ll sign &lsquo;em. As for the competent part&mdash;well,&rdquo;
       with a chuckle, &ldquo;that child&rsquo;s pretty competent herself. I have a notion
      that, take it five or six years from now, it&rsquo;ll be her that&rsquo;ll be bringin&rsquo; 
      us up in the way we should go. I feel a good deal as if I was signin&rsquo; on
      for a long voyage with the chances that I&rsquo;d finish mate instead of
      skipper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Judge,&rdquo; he added, just before leaving for home, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing
      more I&rsquo;d like to say. &lsquo;Most everybody thinks Marcellus left his
      stepdaughter a consider&rsquo;ble sight of money, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I suppose they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, let &lsquo;em think so. &lsquo;Twill give &lsquo;em somethin&rsquo; to talk about.
      They&rsquo;ll be guessin&rsquo; how rich the child is instead of markin&rsquo; off in the
      almanac the days afore Zoeth and me head for the poorhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I see. You don&rsquo;t care to have it known that you and your partner
      are adopting and supporting her purely from motives of kindness and
      generosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! pooh! No generosity about it. Besides, Marcellus was kind and
      generous enough to us in the old days. Pity if we couldn&rsquo;t take our trick
      at the wheel now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good deal more willing to take that trick than
      you were when I saw you last, Captain Shad,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You seem to
      have changed your mind completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grinned. &ldquo;Well, yes, I have,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Maybe &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t so
      big a change as you think; I have a habit of blowin&rsquo; up a squall when I&rsquo;m
      gettin&rsquo; ready to calm down. But, anyway, that young-one would change
      anybody&rsquo;s mind. She&rsquo;s different from any girl of her age ever I saw. She&rsquo;s
      pretty as a little picture and sweet and wholesome as a&mdash;as a summer
      sweet apple. She don&rsquo;t pester, and she don&rsquo;t tease, and she don&rsquo;t lie&mdash;no,
      sir, not even when I&rsquo;d consider layin&rsquo; the course a p&rsquo;int or two from the
      truth a justifiable proceedin&rsquo;. She&rsquo;s got inside my vest, somehow or
      &lsquo;nother, and I did think I was consider&rsquo;ble of a hard-shell. She&rsquo;s all
      right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta is. I&rsquo;m about ready to say &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; to Marcellus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled, and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop was no longer a visitor,
      but a permanent member of the odd household at South Harniss. She was
      delighted when she heard the news, although, characteristically, she said
      very little beyond confiding to her two &ldquo;uncles&rdquo; that she was going to be
      a good girl and not take David into the parlor again. The remainder of her
      &ldquo;things&rdquo; and belongings were sent over by the Judge and, in due time, the
      guardianship papers were signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Zoeth, laying down the pen. &ldquo;That settles it, I
      cal&rsquo;late. Now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, you&rsquo;re our little girl, mine and your Uncle
      Shad&rsquo;s, for good and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite so long as that, Zoeth,&rdquo; put in the smiling Shadrach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
      hang on to her for a spell, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder; but one of these days, a
      hundred years from now or such matter, there&rsquo;s liable to be a good-lookin&rsquo; 
      young feller sparkin&rsquo; &lsquo;round here and he&rsquo;ll want to marry her and take her
      somewheres else. What&rsquo;ll you say when it comes to that, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta thought it over. &ldquo;If &lsquo;twas a hundred years from now,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;I guess he wouldn&rsquo;t want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed uproariously. &ldquo;Well, maybe we can discount that
      hundred some for cash,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Make it twelve or fifteen years.
      Then suppose somebody&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; with a wink at Zoeth&mdash;&ldquo;suppose
      Jimmie Bacheldor, we&rsquo;ll say, comes and wants us to put you in his hands,
      what&rsquo;ll you say then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was prompt enough this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say no,&rdquo; asserted Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, with decision. &ldquo;Jimmie Bacheldor
      hates to wash his hands; he told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that summer she played about the house or at the store or on the beach
      and, when the fall term began, the partners sent her to school. They were
      happy and proud men when Miss Dobson, the primary teacher, said the girl
      was too far advanced for the first class and entered her in the second.
      &ldquo;Just natural smartness,&rdquo; Captain Shadrach declared. &ldquo;Natural smartness
      and nothin&rsquo; else. She ain&rsquo;t had a mite of advantages, but up she goes just
      the same. Why, Teacher told me she considered her a reg&rsquo;lar parachute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A parachute&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; that comes down, ain&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; suggested Zoeth,
      remembering the balloon ascension he had seen at the county fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! So &lsquo;tis. Seems as if &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t parachute she said. &lsquo;Twas&mdash;&lsquo;twas&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parasol?&rdquo; suggested Isaiah, who was an interested listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; nor paralysis neither. Paragon, that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;twas. Teacher said
      that child was a paragon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a paragon?&rdquo; asked Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it&rsquo;s what she is, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The paragon continued to progress in her studies. Also she continued, more
      and more, to take an interest in the housework and the affairs of her
      adopted uncles and Isaiah Chase. Little by little changes came in the life
      of the family. On one memorable Sunday Captain Shadrach attended church.
      It was the first time in a good many years and whether the congregation or
      Zoeth or the Captain himself was the more astonished at the latter&rsquo;s being
      there is a question. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was not greatly astonished. It was the
      result of careful planning on her part, planning which had as its object
      the relieving of Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s mind. Zoeth never missed a Sunday service
      or a Friday night prayer meeting. And, being sincerely religious, he was
      greatly troubled because his friend and partner took little interest in
      such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach&rsquo;s aversion to churches dated back to a sermon preached by a
      former minister. The subject of that sermon was Jonah and the whale. The
      Captain, having been on several whaling voyages in his younger days, had
      his own opinion concerning the prophet&rsquo;s famous adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the minister had been a younger and more tactful man the argument which
      followed might have ended pleasantly and the break have been avoided. But
      the clergyman was elderly, as set in his ways as the Captain was in his,
      and the disagreement was absolute and final.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The feller is a regular wooden-head,&rdquo; declared Shadrach, hotly. &ldquo;I was
      willin&rsquo; to be reasonable; I was willin&rsquo; to give in that this Jonah man
      might have been out of his head and, after he was hove overboard and cast
      ashore, thought he&rsquo;d been swallowed by a whale or somethin&rsquo; or &lsquo;nother. I
      picked up a sailor once who&rsquo;d drifted around in a boat for a week and he
      couldn&rsquo;t remember nothin&rsquo; of what happened after the first day or so. If
      you&rsquo;d told him he&rsquo;d been swallowed by a mackerel he wouldn&rsquo;t have said no.
      But I&rsquo;ve helped kill a good many whales&mdash;yes, and I&rsquo;ve helped cut &lsquo;em
      up, too&mdash;and I know what they look like inside. No man, whether his
      name was Jonah or Jehoshaphat, could have lived three days in a whale&rsquo;s
      stomach. How&rsquo;d he breathe in there, eh? Cal&rsquo;late the whale had ventilators
      and a skylight in his main deck? How&rsquo;d the whale live all that time with a
      man hoppin&rsquo; &lsquo;round inside him? Think I&rsquo;d live if I&mdash;if I swallowed a
      live mouse or somethin&rsquo;? No, sir-ee! Either that mouse would die or I
      would, I bet you! I&rsquo;ve seen a whole parcel of things took out of a whale&rsquo;s
      insides and some of the things had been alive once, too; but they wasn&rsquo;t
      alive then; they was in chunks and part digested. Jonah wasn&rsquo;t digested,
      was he? And the whale wasn&rsquo;t dead of dyspepsy neither. That&rsquo;s what I told
      that minister. &lsquo;You try it yourself,&rsquo; I says to him. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s whales
      enough back of the Crab Ledge, twenty mile off Orham,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      liable to run in sight of &lsquo;em most any fair day in summer. You go off
      there and jump overboard some time and see what happens. First place, no
      whale would swallow you; next place, if it did &lsquo;twould chew you or sift
      you fine first; and, third place, if you was whole and alive that whale
      would be dead inside of ten minutes. You try it and see.&rsquo; Good fair offer,
      wasn&rsquo;t it? But did he take it up? Not much. Said I was a scoffer and an
      infidel and didn&rsquo;t know anything about Scripture! &lsquo;I know about whales,
      anyhow,&rsquo; I told him. And he slammed off and wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me again.
      Don&rsquo;t talk to ME! I&rsquo;ll never go inside that meetin&rsquo;-house again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he never had until Mary-&rsquo;Gusta coaxed him into it. She was a regular
      attendant at Sunday school, but on Sunday mornings in pleasant weather she
      had been accustomed to take a walk with Shadrach. These walks they both
      enjoyed hugely, but one bright morning she announced that she was not
      going for a walk, but was going to church with Uncle Zoeth. Shadrach was
      disappointed and astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sakes! What&rsquo;s this mean?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Thought you liked to walk
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. I like it very much. But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fair for me to do it
      every Sunday. Uncle Zoeth ALWAYS goes to church and he feels real bad
      &lsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t go. He told me so. He says the church folks think you
      won&rsquo;t go to Heaven when you die and that makes him feel dreadful. He&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to Heaven, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He couldn&rsquo;t help it, he&rsquo;s so good. Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;ll go to
      Heaven, Uncle Shad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Zoeth? Sartin I do. If he don&rsquo;t, nobody will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it make you feel bad if you was afraid he wouldn&rsquo;t go there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Maybe so, but I ain&rsquo;t afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but he is afraid YOU won&rsquo;t. He thinks an awful lot of you; as
      much as you do of him, you know. Uncle Shad, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to meetin&rsquo; with
      Uncle Zoeth this mornin&rsquo;, and I want you to go with us; will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain pulled his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about, anyway? You
      don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;d take you walkin&rsquo; Sundays if I thought &lsquo;twas wicked, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; but Uncle Zoeth thinks not goin&rsquo; to church is wicked. If you and
      I went to church with him &lsquo;twould please him ever so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so, but &lsquo;twould please you and me if he went walkin&rsquo; with us. I&rsquo;ve
      asked him times enough. Why can&rsquo;t he do what I want as well as my doin&rsquo; 
      what he wants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause he thinks it&rsquo;s wrong. You don&rsquo;t think goin&rsquo; to church is wrong, do
      you, Uncle Shad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head. &ldquo;By fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular young
      lawyer, you are, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Judge Baxter hasn&rsquo;t got you beat when it
      comes to makin&rsquo; out a case. Look here, now; be honest; hadn&rsquo;t you rather
      go to walk with me than go to that meetin&rsquo;-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; frankly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you had, eh? But all the same you want us to give up our walk and go
      to church every Sunday just to please Zoeth. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta took his hand. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she said shyly, &ldquo;but I thought
      perhaps we could divide up. You and I could go with him one Sunday and to
      walk the next Sunday. That would be fair. I&rsquo;m his little girl same as I am
      yours, Uncle Shad, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was stumped, and he went to church that Sunday morning. The
      sermon had nothing to do with Jonah or the whale, so his feelings were not
      ruffled. Zoeth was mightily pleased and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was happy because he
      was. The plan of alternate Sundays was adopted. It was but one instance of
      the &ldquo;managing&rdquo; quality which the girl possessed. Isaiah declared that she
      wound all hands around her little finger, but even he seemed to enjoy the
      winding.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she grew older Mary-&rsquo;Gusta learned more and more concerning her uncles,
      their habits, their contrasting temperaments and their past history. She
      learned a little of Hall and Company, the prosperous firm of which they
      had been partners, with Marcellus Hall, her stepfather, as the head.
      Isaiah told her a little concerning the firm: &ldquo;No bigger on Cape Cod,&rdquo; he
      declared. She asked why it had not continued in business. Mr. Chase
      brusquely answered that it hadn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all, and would not give any
      particulars. She questioned the steward concerning Shadrach and Zoeth. The
      former had never married; that was funny; why hadn&rsquo;t he? Isaiah said he
      did not know. Hadn&rsquo;t Uncle Zoeth ever married, either? Yes, Zoeth had
      married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did&mdash;&rdquo; began Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, but Isaiah cut short the catechizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t ask such questions,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why mustn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause you mustn&rsquo;t. Your uncles wouldn&rsquo;t like it a mite if they knew you
      was pryin&rsquo; into their affairs. You mustn&rsquo;t ever say a word about your
      Uncle Zoeth&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he like me any more if I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you bet he wouldn&rsquo;t; he&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he wouldn&rsquo;t come to
      hate you. And you mustn&rsquo;t say it to Cap&rsquo;n Shad neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea of being hated by Uncle Zoeth was a dreadful one and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      avoided the tabooed subject. But she thought about it a good deal. She
      noticed that in neither of the two lots in the cemetery, one where the
      Goulds were buried and the other the Hamiltons, was a stone erected to the
      memory of the &ldquo;beloved wife of Zoeth Hamilton,&rdquo; although other beloved
      wives of the former generations were commemorated. This seemed odd. As her
      education progressed she read more and more and from her reading she built
      up several imaginative romances with Zoeth as the hero, and as the
      heroines beautiful creatures who had died young, in shipwreck, probably,
      and whose names were not to be mentioned because. . . . She could not find
      a satisfactory solution of the because. Shipwreck or burial at sea she
      deduced from the fact of there being no grave in the cemetery. Mothers and
      fathers of several of her schoolmates had been buried at sea. Perhaps the
      late Mrs. Hamilton had been so buried. But Zoeth had never been a
      seafaring man.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Saturday afternoon&mdash;she was about ten years old at the time&mdash;she
      was in the garret. The garret had taken the place of the old surrey at
      Ostable, and thither she retired when she wished to be alone to read, or
      play, or study. This afternoon she was rummaging through the old trunks
      and sea chests in search of a costume for Rose. It was to be a masculine
      costume, of course, for there was no feminine apparel in that garret, but
      in the games which the girl played when alone with her dolls, Rose, the
      largest of the family, was frequently obliged to change her sex with her
      raiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had ransacked these trunks and chests pretty thoroughly on
      previous occasions, but this time she made a discovery. In an old trunk
      which had obviously belonged to Captain Shadrach she found a sort of
      pocket on the under side of the lid, a pocket closing with a flap and a
      catch. In this pocket were some papers, old receipts and the like, and a
      photograph. The photograph interested her exceedingly. It was yellow and
      faded but still perfectly distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a large building standing on posts fixed in the sand, and beyond
      it were wharves and a glimpse of schooners and the sea. Barrels, a good
      many barrels, were piled upon the wharves and at the end of the building.
      Over the door was the sign, &ldquo;Hall and Company, Wholesale Fish Dealers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sign of itself was interesting enough. Evidently here was the place
      where her stepfather and Captain Gould and Mr. Hamilton had done business
      years before. But more interesting still was the group of men standing on
      the platform under the sign. There were four of these men, dressed in
      clothes and hats which&mdash;especially the hats&mdash;looked queer and
      old-fashioned now. Two of the men Mary-&rsquo;Gusta recognized, or thought she
      did. They were Captain Shadrach and Mr. Hamilton. Much younger they
      looked, of course; their hair was not gray and Zoeth wore a beard, while
      Shadrach had only a mustache. But, in spite of these things and the odd
      clothes they wore, she was sure she recognized them. And, having
      recognized them, she also recognized the man in the center of the group as
      her stepfather, Captain Marcellus Hall. The fourth man, evidently younger
      than the others, a handsome, square-shouldered chap in his shirtsleeves,
      she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned the photograph over. On its back was written:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Firm of Hall and Company.  Taken August 19th, 1877.
             Marcellus Hall
             Zoeth J. Hamilton
             Edgar S. Farmer
             Shadrach B. Gould.
</pre>
    <p>
      The names were in differing handwritings. Evidently each man had signed
      the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta scrutinized the photograph again. Then, with it in her hand,
      she descended to the kitchen. Isaiah was sitting in a chair by the stove
      reading a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chase,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;who was Edgar S. Farmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If that kitchen chair had been the never-to-be-forgotten piece of
      furniture with the music box beneath it and that box had started to play,
      Isaiah could not have risen more promptly. He literally jumped to his feet
      and the paper flew from his hands. He whirled upon the questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pale, actually pale. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I just asked&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;I just asked who&mdash;who&mdash;What
      CAN be the matter, Mr. Chase?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah waved his hand. &ldquo;WHAT did you ask?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked&mdash;I asked who Edgar S. Farmer was, that&rsquo;s all. I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still! Be still, for mercy sakes! What do you know about Ed Farmer?
      Who told you about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was more frightened than ever. Isaiah&rsquo;s next move did not tend to
      reassure her. He strode to the door, looked up the lane, and closed and
      locked the door before she could find words to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said, coming close to her and looking her straight in the
      face, &ldquo;who told you about Ed Farmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody told me. Honest, they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody must have told you; else how did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hesitatingly held up the photograph. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s written on this,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase snatched it from her hand. He looked at the picture and then at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s written on the back,&rdquo; went on the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah turned the photograph over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he said suspiciously. &ldquo;I see. Who gave this to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody gave it to me. I found it in an old trunk up in the attic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You did, eh? Well, I swan to man! Have you showed it to anybody
      else but me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Honest, I haven&rsquo;t. I just found it this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan, that&rsquo;s lucky. &lsquo;Twas in a trunk, eh? Whose trunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of Uncle Shad&rsquo;s, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I presume likely. Well, what made you ask about&mdash;about the
      one you did ask about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew who the others were. I knew my father and Uncle Zoeth and Uncle
      Shad. But I didn&rsquo;t know who the Farmer one was. It says &lsquo;Firm of Hall and
      Company,&rsquo; and all those names are signed. So I thought maybe Mr. Farmer
      was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind who he was. He was a darned blackguard and his name ain&rsquo;t
      mentioned in this house. That&rsquo;s all I can tell you and you mustn&rsquo;t ask any
      more questions. Why, if your Uncle Zoeth&mdash;yes, or your Uncle Shad
      either&mdash;was to hear you askin&rsquo; about him&mdash;they&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know what they&rsquo;d do. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tear this thing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have torn the photograph across, but the girl seized his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t mine. It belongs
      to Uncle Shad. You mustn&rsquo;t tear it&mdash;give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah hesitated. &ldquo;Give it to you?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it right back where I found it. Truly, I will. I will, honest,
      Mr. Chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah reflected. Then, and with considerable reluctance, he handed her
      the photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;only be sure you do it. And look here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,
      don&rsquo;t you ever touch it again and don&rsquo;t you ever tell either of your
      uncles or anybody else that you found it. You hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta said that she heard. She ran to the garret and replaced the
      photograph in the pocket of the trunk. She did not mention it again nor
      did Isaiah, but thereafter when her active imagination constructed a life
      romance with Mr. Zoeth Hamilton as its hero, that romance contained a
      villain also, and the villain&rsquo;s name was Edgar S. Farmer. And the firm of
      Hall and Company, her father&rsquo;s firm, had a fourth and most mysterious
      partner who was a blackguard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The summers and winters came and went and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s birthdays came and
      went with them. She grew taller and more mature. Her place as assistant
      housekeeper was recognized now and even Isaiah consulted her on matters of
      household management. As for her uncles, she managed them whether
      consulted or not. They took the place of the discarded dolls; she was too
      old for dolls now, although David was still mothered and petted as much as
      ever. But when Uncle Zoeth had a cold it was she who insisted upon his
      wrapping up and saw that the wraps were ready, and if Uncle Shad was
      caught wearing socks with holes in them he was scolded and supplied with
      fresh ones. She selected the clothes they should wear and insisted that
      they black their boots on Sunday. She helped them in the store and it
      became occasionally possible for them to leave that place of business at
      the same time without engaging the services of Annabel. At first the
      partners, Captain Shadrach especially, protested against the supervision
      and the innovations, but Mary-&rsquo;Gusta tactfully and diplomatically carried
      each point, and, after a time, the Captain ceased to protest and accepted
      the inevitable almost with meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, Zoeth,&rdquo; he said on one occasion; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked and talked but I&rsquo;m
      wearin&rsquo; the necktie just the same. I told her &lsquo;twas too good to wear
      weekdays and it ought to be saved for Sunday, but it ain&rsquo;t Sunday and I&rsquo;ve
      got it on. She said &lsquo;twas becomin&rsquo; and the one I&rsquo;ve been wearin&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t
      and that she crocheted it for me and I don&rsquo;t know what all. So here I am.
      Got so I ain&rsquo;t even boss of my own neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;tis becomin&rsquo;,&rdquo; observed Zoeth. &ldquo;And she did crochet it for you. I
      noticed you didn&rsquo;t stop her tyin&rsquo; it on you even while you was vowin&rsquo; you
      wouldn&rsquo;t wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach sighed. &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;that I, Cap&rsquo;n Shad Gould, a man
      that&rsquo;s handled as many fo&rsquo;mast hands as I have, should come to be led
      around by the nose by a slip of a girl! By fire, I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hardly
      believe it. It&rsquo;s disgraceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth smiled. &ldquo;Oh, be still, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You bear up under the
      disgrace as well as anybody ever I saw. You know perfectly well you was
      tickled to death to have her tie that necktie on you. You was grinnin&rsquo; 
      like a Chessy cat all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t, neither. I was chokin&rsquo;, not grinnin&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t know a grin
      from a choke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth changed the subject. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty pretty necktie,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t anybody in this town, unless it&rsquo;s Philander Bearse&rsquo;s wife,
      that can crochet any better&rsquo;n that girl of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach snorted. &ldquo;What are you talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Etta Bearse
      never saw the day she could crochet like that. No, nor do anything else so
      well, either. Look at the way our candy trade has picked up since
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta fixed up the showcase. You cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twas all right the way
      &lsquo;twas afore and thought &lsquo;twas foolish to change, but she changed it and&mdash;well,
      we&rsquo;ve sold a third again as much candy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth&rsquo;s smile broadened. &ldquo;Seems as if I remember your sayin&rsquo; a few things
      about that showcase,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;You gave me fits for lettin&rsquo; her fuss
      with it. Annabel was in t&rsquo;other day and she said folks thought &lsquo;twas queer
      enough our lettin&rsquo; a thirteen-year-old child run our store for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, eh? She&rsquo;s jealous, that&rsquo;s what ails her. And to think of HER
      sayin&rsquo; it. That Annabel&rsquo;s all brass, like a ship&rsquo;s spyglass. By the
      jumpin&rsquo; Judas! I&rsquo;m proud of that showcase and I&rsquo;m proud of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
      She don&rsquo;t make many mistakes: I can&rsquo;t remember of her makin&rsquo; any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither can I, not even in neckties. There, there, Shadrach! I know you.
      You talk about disgrace and such, but you&rsquo;re as crazy about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta as&mdash;as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are, eh? Well, maybe I am, Zoeth. When she was first willed to us,
      as you might say, I used to wonder how we&rsquo;d ever get along with her; now I
      wonder how we got along without her. If she should be&mdash;er&mdash;took
      away from us, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh, shh, Shadrach! Don&rsquo;t talk about anything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was making good progress at school. At fourteen she graduated
      from the grammar school and in the fall was to enter the high school. She
      was popular among her mates, although she never sought popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At picnics and church sociables she had always a small circle about her
      and the South Harniss boys were prominent in that circle. But Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,
      although she liked boys and girls well enough, never showed a liking for
      one more than the other and she was too busy at the house and in the store
      to have her young friends hanging about. They bothered her, she said. As
      for having a particular friend of the other sex, which some of the girls
      in her class no older than she seemed to think a necessary proof of being
      in their teens, she laughed at the idea. She had her adopted uncles and
      Isaiah to take care of and boy beaux were silly. Talking about them as
      these girls did was sillier still.
    </p>
    <p>
      That summer&mdash;the summer preceding Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday&mdash;was
      the liveliest South Harniss had known. The village was beginning to feel
      the first symptoms of its later boom as a summer resort. A number of
      cottages had been built for people from Boston and New York and Chicago,
      and there was talk of a new hotel. Also there was talk of several new
      stores, but Hamilton and Company were inclined to believe this merely talk
      and did not worry about it. Their trade was unusually brisk and the demand
      for Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s services as salesgirl interfered considerably with her
      duties as assistant housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine, clear July morning she came up to the store early in order that
      the partners might go down to the house for breakfast. They had gone and
      she had just finished placing on the counters and in other likely spots
      about the store sheets of sticky fly paper. Flies are a nuisance in South
      Harniss in midsummer and Captain Shad detested them. Just as the last
      sheet was laid in place, a young fellow and a girl came in. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      recognized them both. The girl was the seventeen-year-old daughter of a
      wealthy summer resident, a Mr. Keith from Chicago. The Keiths had a fine
      cottage on the bluff at the other end of the village. The young chap with
      her was, so gossip reported, a college friend of her brother. His surname
      was prosaic enough, being Smith, but his first name was Crawford and his
      home was somewhere in the Far West. He was big and good-looking, and the
      Boston papers mentioned him as one of the most promising backs on the
      Harvard Freshman eleven. Next year, so the sporting writers opined, he
      would almost certainly make the Varsity team. Most of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s
      feminine friends and acquaintances rated him &ldquo;perfectly splendid&rdquo; and
      regarded Edna Keith with envious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning both he and the Keith girl were arrayed in the gayest of
      summer regalia. Young Smith&rsquo;s white flannel trousers were carefully
      creased, his blue serge coat was without a wrinkle, his tie and socks were
      a perfect match, and his cap was of a style which the youth of South
      Harniss might be wearing the following summer, but not this one. Take him
      &ldquo;by and large,&rdquo; as Captain Shadrach would have said, Crawford Smith was an
      immaculate and beautiful exhibit; of which fact he, being eighteen years
      of age, was doubtless quite aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and the Keith girl were, so Mary-&rsquo;Gusta learned, a committee of two
      selected to purchase certain supplies for a beach picnic, a combination
      clambake and marshmallow toast, which was to take place over at Setuckit
      Point that day. Sam Keith, Edna&rsquo;s brother, and the other members of the
      party had gone on to Jabez Hedges&rsquo; residence, where Jabez had promised to
      meet them with the clams and other things for the bake. Edna and her
      escort, having made their purchases at Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s, were to
      join them at the &ldquo;clam-man&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Then the whole party was to go down to the
      wharf and the sailboat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Edna, who was a talkative damsel, informed Mary-&rsquo;Gusta of these facts
      at once. Also she announced that they must hurry like everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we told Sam and the rest we&rsquo;d be at the clam-man&rsquo;s
      in ten minutes, and, if we&rsquo;re not there, Sam will be awfully cross. He
      hates to wait for people. And we&rsquo;ve been too long already. It&rsquo;s all your
      fault, Crawford; you would stop to hear that fruit man talk. I told you
      you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;fruit man&rdquo; was Mr. Gaius Small, and, although he stammered, he loved
      the sound of his own voice. The demand for a dozen oranges furnished Gaius
      with subject sufficient for a lengthy monologue&mdash;&ldquo;forty drawls and
      ten stutters to every orange,&rdquo; quoting Captain Shad again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you you mustn&rsquo;t get him started,&rdquo; went on Miss Keith, gushingly.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll talk forever if he has a chance. But you would do it. Asking him if
      he kept pomegranates and bread-fruit! The idea! I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t know
      what a pomegranate is. You were SO solemn and he was SO ridiculous! I
      thought I should DIE. You really are the drollest person, Crawford Smith!
      I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that her opinion of young Smith was not different from that
      of other young ladies of her age. Also that Crawford himself was not
      entirely unconscious of that opinion. At eighteen, to be set upon a
      pedestal and worshiped, to have one&rsquo;s feeblest joke hailed as a
      masterpiece of wit, is dangerous for the idol; the effort of sustaining
      the elevated position entails the risk of a fall. Crawford was but
      eighteen and a good fellow, but he had been worshiped a good deal. He was
      quite as sensible as other young chaps of his age, which statement means
      exactly that and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with a complacent grin, &ldquo;we learned how to pronounce
      &lsquo;pomegranate&rsquo; at any rate. You begin with a pup-pup-pup, as if you were
      calling a dog, and you finish with a grunt like a pig. I wish I had asked
      him for a persimmon; then he&rsquo;d have made a noise like a cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Keith, when she recovered from her spasm of merriment, declared her
      companion &ldquo;perfectly killing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we must hurry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We really must Crawford, you buy the
      things. I should think of that fruit man and laugh all the time, I know I
      should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained by the door and the young gentleman strolled to the counter.
      He cast an amused glance about the store; its display of stock was, thanks
      to Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s recent efforts at tidiness, not quite the conglomerate
      mass it had been when the partners were solely responsible, but the
      variety was still strikingly obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; observed Crawford; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten what we came to buy, but I&rsquo;m
      sure it is here, whatever it is. Some emporium, this! Introduce me to the
      proprietor, will you, Edna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t the proprietor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is just the clerk, that&rsquo;s all.
      Her name is&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten your name, dear. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Lathrop,&rdquo; replied Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, shortly. She objected to being
      addressed as &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and she strongly objected to the patronizing tone in
      which it was uttered. Edna Keith was older than she, but not old enough to
      patronize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, so it is,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t what everyone
      calls you. They call you something else&mdash;something funny&mdash;Oh, I
      know! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, that&rsquo;s it. I knew it was funny. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, this is
      Mr. Smith. He wants to buy some things. And he&rsquo;s in a GREAT hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charmed, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; said Mr. Smith. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not appear
      charmed. She asked him what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Search ME,&rdquo; said the young gentleman, cheerfully. &ldquo;There was a list,
      wasn&rsquo;t there, Edna? You have it, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna produced the list, scrawled in pencil on the back of an envelope.
      Crawford looked it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s writing isn&rsquo;t exactly print,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;but I can guess at it.
      Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;a pound of butter. Where&rsquo;s the butter department of this
      Bon Marche, Edna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna, after another convulsion, declared she didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Mary Jane knows,&rdquo; went on her companion.
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course she does. Right there, behind the oilskin jacket.
      Remove jacket, open door&mdash;behold, the icebox and the butter. Neat,
      compact, and convenient. One pound only, Elizabeth Eliza. Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name isn&rsquo;t Elizabeth Eliza,&rdquo; giggled Miss Keith. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he awful,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! You mustn&rsquo;t mind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, promptly. &ldquo;What else do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford consulted the list. &ldquo;The next item,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;appears to be a&mdash;er&mdash;certain
      kind of ham. I blush to mention it, but I must. It is deviled ham. Have
      you that kind of ham, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta took the can of deviled ham from the shelf. Crawford shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that one so young should be so familiar with ham of that kind!&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t speak its name, though. Suppose I had asked you what
      kind of ham you had, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;&lsquo;Gusta how would you have got
      around it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not answer. She was very angry, but she was determined
      that her tormentor should not know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young lady of few words,&rdquo; commented Mr. Smith. &ldquo;Next item appears to be
      six boxes of marshmallows. Where is the marshmallow department, Mary
      Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta hesitated. The tin boxes of marshmallows were on the shelf
      behind the counter under the candy case. But there was a fresh assortment
      in an unopened packing box in the back room, a box which had just come
      from the wholesale confectioner&rsquo;s in Boston. Her Uncle Zoeth had expressed
      a fear that those beneath the counter were rather stale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Keith fidgeted. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This is SO slow. I know
      Sam and the rest won&rsquo;t wait for us at the clam-man&rsquo;s much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion whistled. &ldquo;Is the word &lsquo;hurry&rsquo; in the South Harniss
      dictionary, Edna?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;How about it, Mary Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was determined not to hurry. This superior young man wished
      her to do so and that was reason sufficient for delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Smith sighed resignedly. &ldquo;Edna,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;suppose we sit down. The
      word is NOT in the dictionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was but one chair, except those behind the counters, in the store.
      Miss Keith took that with an exclamation of impatience. Crawford Smith,
      whistling a mournful dirge, sauntered to the end of the counter and sat
      down upon a nail keg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta also uttered an exclamation. It is well to look before one
      leaps, also, occasionally, before one sits. That keg had, spread across
      its top, a sheet of the fresh and very sticky fly paper. Before she could
      have protested, even if she had wished to do so, the young gentleman&rsquo;s
      spotless white flannels and the fly paper came in contact, close and
      clinging contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta put a hand to her mouth. Crawford looked at her, caught the
      direction of her look, and looked in that direction himself. His whistle
      stopped in the middle of a note and his face immediately became a match
      for his socks and tie, a beautiful rich crimson, the chosen color of his
      University.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Keith, from her seat by the door, could not see beyond the end of the
      counter. Consequently she was unaware of the mishap to the white flannels.
      But Mary-&rsquo;Gusta saw and knew; also she could see that Mr. Smith knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; exclaimed Edna, impatiently. &ldquo;We are dreadfully late now.
      We&rsquo;ll never get there on time. Sam won&rsquo;t wait for us; I know he won&rsquo;t.
      Where are those marshmallows? Can&rsquo;t you please hurry, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling. Her manner was provokingly deliberate.
      She took a box of marshmallows from beneath the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid they aren&rsquo;t very fresh.
      The fresh ones, those that have just come, are in a box in the back room.
      That box hasn&rsquo;t been opened yet. If you can wait I&rsquo;ll open it for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Smith said nothing. Miss Keith, however, spoke her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure these will do. They
      will do, won&rsquo;t they, Crawford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still Crawford remained silent. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, who was enjoying this
      portion of the interview as much as she had disliked its beginning,
      offered a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will just come here and look at these,&rdquo; she said, with mischievous
      gravity, addressing the young gentleman on the nail keg, &ldquo;perhaps you can
      tell whether they&rsquo;re fresh enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman did not rise. His face retained its brilliant color
      and his lips moved, but his answer was not audible. At his age the dread
      of appearing ridiculous, especially in the presence of a youthful and
      charming female, is above all others hateful. And Edna Keith was not the
      only girl in the picnic party; there were others. She would be certain to
      tell them. Crawford Smith foresaw a horrible day, a day of disgrace and
      humiliation, one in which he was destined to furnish amusement without
      sharing the fun. And Sam Keith, who had remarked upon the splendor of his
      friend&rsquo;s attire, would gloat&mdash;not only here in South Harniss, but
      elsewhere&mdash;in Cambridge, for instance. An older man would have risen,
      laughed whether he felt like laughing or not&mdash;and have expressed his
      opinion of fly paper. Crawford was not yet a man; he was in the transition
      stage, a boy fondly hoping that other people might think him a man. So he
      sat still until it was too late to rise, and then wished he had risen in
      the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed the fidgety Miss Keith, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you look at
      them, Crawford? What are you waiting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, the box of marshmallows in her hand, regarded the boy on the
      nail keg. His eyes met hers and in them was a look of such utter misery
      that the girl relented. Her feeling of satisfied resentment changed to one
      almost of pity. She had been made to feel ridiculous herself at various
      times in her short life and she remembered the sensation. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, as
      has been mentioned before in this history, was old for her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered a moment. Then she thrust the box beneath the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better not sell you those, anyway,&rdquo; she said with decision.
      &ldquo;Uncle Zoeth said they weren&rsquo;t fresh. I&rsquo;ll open the case in the back
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait for that,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;We must go without them, I
      suppose. Oh, dear! And they depended on us to get them. It&rsquo;s so provoking.
      Now we can&rsquo;t have any toast at all and it would have been such fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta glanced once more at the occupant of the keg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; she said, slowly, &ldquo;that you needn&rsquo;t both wait unless you
      wanted to. Perhaps Miss Keith might go on and tell the others and&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.
      Smith could stay here until I opened the box. Then he could meet you at
      the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna hesitated. &ldquo;Shall I, Crawford?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion did not hesitate. &ldquo;I think perhaps you&rsquo;d better, Edna,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Keith hurried out. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta turned her attention to the remaining
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get up now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some of it will tear off, anyway, and if
      you hurry you will have time to run home and change your&mdash;your
      clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford was evidently much surprised, also his embarrassment was not
      lessened; but he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then you knew?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I knew. I saw you sit down on it, didn&rsquo;t I? If I&rsquo;d known what
      you were going to do I&rsquo;d have told you to look out. But you did it so
      quick I couldn&rsquo;t. Now tear off as much as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman obeyed orders. &ldquo;Does it show much?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t see. Is there much left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta smiled. His contortions were as violent as they were vain.
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;Here are the things you bought. Now go
      out of the back door and cut across the fields. It&rsquo;s the shortest way
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smith took his various parcels, including the six boxes of
      marshmallows which Mary-&rsquo;Gusta produced from beneath the counter. &ldquo;I
      thought you said these were stale,&rdquo; he observed, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said they weren&rsquo;t real fresh, but they&rsquo;re fresh enough for a toast. I
      said that so that the Keith girl wouldn&rsquo;t wait. I didn&rsquo;t think you wanted
      her to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your life I didn&rsquo;t! So that&rsquo;s why you said you would have to open
      the other box? Just&mdash;just to help me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Now don&rsquo;t stop any longer. You&rsquo;ll have to run, you know. Go out the
      back way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford started for the door of the back room, but at that door he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, feelingly, &ldquo;this is mighty white of you, do you know it?
      And after the way I guyed you when I first came in! I guess I was rather
      fresh, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I guess I was. I thought you were just a country kid, you know,
      and I&mdash;say, by George, you WERE white. If I&rsquo;d been you I&rsquo;d have got
      square. You had the chance; &lsquo;twould have served me right for playing the
      smart Aleck. I beg your pardon. You&rsquo;re all RIGHT! And I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I
      was such a chump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a straightforward, honest apology and confession of fault.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was pleased, but she did not show it. He had referred to her
      as a kid and she did not like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hurry&mdash;yes, and run like everything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
      won&rsquo;t have time to get home and change and meet the others at the boat.
      And somebody else will see you, too. You&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man went without further delay. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta watching from the
      back door saw him racing across the fields in the direction of the Keith
      cottage. When her uncles returned she said nothing of the occurrence. She
      considered it funny, but she knew Crawford Smith did not, and she was sure
      he would prefer to have the secret kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following afternoon the partners of Hamilton and Company entertained a
      caller at the store. That evening Shadrach spoke of the call to
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young Smith feller that&rsquo;s been visitin&rsquo; the Keiths was in today,&rdquo;
       said the Captain. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to buy nothin&rsquo;; said he just happened in,
      that&rsquo;s all. Asked where you was, he did. I didn&rsquo;t know he knew you,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, who was busy clearing the supper table, answered without
      looking round. &ldquo;He and Edna Keith bought some things at the store
      yesterday,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so he said. He said tell you everything was all right and he had a
      fine time at the picnic. Seemed to cal&rsquo;late you was a pretty bright girl.
      We knew that afore, of course, but it was nice of him to say so. He&rsquo;s
      leavin&rsquo; on tomorrow mornin&rsquo;s train. Goin&rsquo; way out West, he is, to Nevada;
      that&rsquo;s where he and his dad live. His ma&rsquo;s dead, so he told us. Must be
      tough to live so fur off from salt water: I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, I know
      that. Funny thing about that young feller, too; his face looked sort of
      familiar to me and Zoeth. Seemed as if he looked like somebody we knew,
      but of course we didn&rsquo;t know any of his folks; we don&rsquo;t know any Smiths
      from way off there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The subject was dropped for the time, but two days later the expressman
      brought a package to the house. The package was addressed to Miss Mary
      Augusta Lathrop and contained a five-pound basket of expensive chocolates
      and bonbons. There was a note with it which read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope you&rsquo;ll like these. They are fresh, at least Huyler&rsquo;s people swear
      they are, but I don&rsquo;t believe they are as good as those marshmallows. And
      I KNOW they are not as fresh as a certain person was at a certain time.
      Please eat them and forget the other freshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      C. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were a perfect little brick not to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was obliged to tell then, but she made her uncles and Isaiah
      promise not to do so. She, with the able assistance of the other members
      of the household, ate the contents of the basket in due time. The basket
      itself was taken to the parlor, where it was given a place beside the
      other curiosities. As for the note, that disappeared. And yet, if one had
      investigated the contents of the small drawer of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s bureau,
      where she kept her most intimate treasures, the mystery of its
      disappearance might have been solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only epistle of its kind the girl had yet received; and, after
      all, good-looking young college men are what they are. And Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, in
      spite of her queerness, was feminine&mdash;and human.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was seventeen a great event took place. The happening
      which led to it was trivial enough, but the results were important and
      far-reaching. They led to the second great change in her life, a change as
      important as that brought about by her memorable &ldquo;visit&rdquo; to South Harniss.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a girl in years still, but tall for her age, and in thought and
      manner almost a young woman. Her management of her uncles and Isaiah was
      now complete. They no longer protested, even to each other, against the
      management and, in fact, gloried in it. The cook and steward accepted her
      orders concerning the daily marketing and he and she audited the monthly
      bills. The white house by the shore was a different place altogether now
      and &ldquo;chicken-pox tablecloths&rdquo; and tarnished silver were things of the
      forgotten past. At the store she had become almost a silent partner, and
      Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s &ldquo;emporium&rdquo; was, thanks to her judgment and tact, if
      not yet an up-to-date establishment, at least a shop where commodities to
      be sold were in places where they might be seen by prospective purchasers
      and readily located by the proprietors.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent a good deal of her time, except in school hours, at the store
      and much of the buying as well as the selling was done by her. The
      drummers representing New York and Boston wholesale houses knew her and
      cherished keen respect for her abilities as a selector and purchaser of
      goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said one of these gentlemen, after a lengthy session during which
      his attempts to work off several &ldquo;stickers&rdquo; had been frustrated by
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s common sense and discernment&mdash;&ldquo;Say, that girl of yours
      is a wonder, do you know it? She&rsquo;s the sharpest buyer I ever run across on
      my trips down here. I don&rsquo;t take a back seat for anybody when it comes to
      selling goods, and there&rsquo;s mighty little I can&rsquo;t sell; but I can&rsquo;t bluff
      her. She knows what&rsquo;s what, you hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach, to whom this remark was made, chuckled. &ldquo;You bet you!&rdquo; he
      declared, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Anybody that gets ahead of our Mary-&rsquo;Gusta has
      got to turn out afore the mornin&rsquo; watch. She&rsquo;s smart. Zoeth and me ain&rsquo;t
      aboard the same craft with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not. And you can&rsquo;t get gay with her, either. Most girls of
      her age and as good a looker as she is don&rsquo;t object to a little ragging:
      they&rsquo;re used to it and they like it&mdash;but not her. She isn&rsquo;t fishing
      for boxes of candy or invitations to dances. That line of talk means
      good-by and no sale where she is. Business and just business, that&rsquo;s all
      there is to her. How long are you goin&rsquo; to keep her here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long? Why, forever, I hope. What are you talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drummer winked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You want to keep
      her, I don&rsquo;t doubt: but one of these days somebody else&rsquo;ll be wanting her
      more than you do. Mr. Right&rsquo;ll be coming along here some time and then&mdash;good
      night! She&rsquo;s young yet, but in a couple of years she&rsquo;ll be a queen and
      then&mdash;well, then maybe I&rsquo;ll stand a better chance of unloading those
      last summer caps the house has got in stock. Girls like her don&rsquo;t stay
      single and keep store; there&rsquo;s too much demand and not enough competition.
      Gad! If I wasn&rsquo;t an antique and married already I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;d be
      getting into line. That&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach was inclined to be angry, but, although he would not have
      admitted it, he realized the truth of this frank statement. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      was pretty, she was more than that, and the line was already forming.
      Jimmie Bacheldor had long ago ceased to be a competitor; that friendship
      had ended abruptly at the time of David&rsquo;s narrow escape; but there were
      others, plenty of them. Daniel Higgins, son of Mr. Solomon Higgins, the
      local lumber dealer and undertaker, was severely smitten. Dan was at work
      in Boston, where he was engaged in the cheerful and remunerative business
      of selling coffins for the American Casket Company. He was diligent and
      active and his future promised to be bright, at least so his proud father
      boasted. He came home for holidays and vacations and his raiment was
      anything but funereal, but Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was not impressed either by the
      raiment or the personality beneath it. She treated the persistent Daniel
      as a boy and a former schoolmate. When he assumed manly airs she laughed
      at him and when he invited her to accompany him to the Cattle Show at
      Ostable she refused and said she was going with Uncle Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dan Higgins was not the only young fellow who found the store of Hamilton
      and Company an attractive lounging place. Some of the young gentlemen not
      permanent residents of South Harniss also appeared to consider it a
      pleasant place to visit on Summer afternoons. They came to buy, of course,
      but they remained to chat. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta might have sailed or picknicked a
      good deal and in the best of company, socially speaking, if she had cared
      to do so. She did not so care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want me, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course they want you,&rdquo; declared Shadrach, stoutly. &ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t want
      you they wouldn&rsquo;t ask you, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely. And I heard that young Keith
      feller askin&rsquo; you to go out sailin&rsquo; with him this very afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear his sister ask me, did you? There, there, Uncle Shad,
      don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m having a good time; a very much better time than
      if I went sailing with the Keiths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the Keiths? They&rsquo;re as nice folks as come to South
      Harniss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! And you&rsquo;re as good as they are, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. Uncle Shad, why don&rsquo;t you wear a white flannel suit in hot
      weather? Mr. Keith, Sam&rsquo;s father, wore one at the church garden party the
      other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain stared at her. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I wear&mdash;what?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A white flannel suit. You&rsquo;re as good as Mr. Keith, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I am. I don&rsquo;t know why I ain&rsquo;t. But what kind of a question&rsquo;s
      that? I&rsquo;d look like a plain fool tagged out in one of them things: anyway,
      I&rsquo;d feel like one. I don&rsquo;t belong in a white flannel suit. I ain&rsquo;t no
      imitation dude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t belong in Sam Keith&rsquo;s yacht. At least Mr. Keith and Edna
      would feel that I didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t want to be considered an imitation,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t like anybody else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
      funny girl, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am; but I&rsquo;m not as funny as I should be if I tried to BE
      somebody else. No, Uncle Shad, you&rsquo;ll just have to bear with me as I am,
      funniness and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days after this Keith, senior, came into the store. He was not
      arrayed in the white flannels but was wearing a rather shabby but very
      comfortable tweed jacket and trousers and a white canvas hat of the kind
      which Hamilton and Company sold for fifty cents. His shirt was of the
      soft-collared variety and his shoes were what South Harniss called
      &ldquo;sneakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Keith&rsquo;s visits to Cape Cod were neither very frequent nor lengthy.
      His wife and family came in June and remained until late September, but
      his sojourns were seldom longer than a week at a time and there were
      intervals of a month or more between them. In Chicago he was the head of a
      large business and that business demanded close attention. When he left it
      he left his cares with it and enjoyed himself in his own way. That way
      included old clothes, golf, a boat, and just as few tea and garden parties
      as his wife would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was planning a fishing trip and had stopped at the store to buy some
      tobacco. The partners had gone home for dinner and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was tending
      shop. At that moment she was busy with the traveling representative of
      Messrs. Bernstein, Goldberg and Baun, of Providence, wholesale dealers in
      stationery, cards and novelties. The time was August, but Mr. Kron, the
      drummer, was already booking orders for the Christmas season. His samples
      were displayed upon the counter and he and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta were deep in
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you ought to have,&rdquo; declared Mr. Kron, with enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;Believe me, there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be some call for that line of stuff this
      year. The house can&rsquo;t turn &lsquo;em out fast enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; asked Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a combination calendar and beauty-box,&rdquo; explained Mr. Kron. &ldquo;Hang it
      on the wall by your bureau&mdash;see? In the mornin&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t remember
      what day it is. All right, there&rsquo;s the calendar. Then you want to doll
      yourself up for&mdash;well, for the party you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same morning?&rdquo; interrupted Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kron grinned. He was a young man and this was his first trip in that
      section. His clothes were neither modest nor retiring and he, himself, did
      not suffer from these failings. Also he prided himself on having a way
      with the ladies, especially the younger ladies. And Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was
      distinctly the most attractive young person he had met on this trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in appreciation of the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he observed, admiringly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re up to the minute, ain&rsquo;t you!
      You&rsquo;re some kidder, all right. Are there many more in this burg like you?
      If there are I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to move in and settle down. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta did not laugh, nor did she answer. Instead, she turned to the
      gentleman who had entered the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Keith,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Was there anything you wanted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith smiled. &ldquo;No hurry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little time to kill and if
      you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;ll kill it here. I&rsquo;ll sit down and wait, if I may. That
      boatman of mine will be along pretty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the chair by the door. Mr. Kron continued his exploitation of the
      combination calendar and beauty-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are goin&rsquo; to a party,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;either that night or that
      afternoon or sometime. Sure you are! Girls like you ain&rsquo;t handed the go-by
      on many parties in this neck of the woods&mdash;am I right? Well, then,
      when the time comes, you pull down the flap. There&rsquo;s your beauty-box,
      lookin&rsquo;-glass, powder puff and powder, all complete. Now a novelty like
      that will sell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t use it,&rdquo; interrupted Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;Show me something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kron, disappointed but far from discouraged, showed her something else&mdash;many
      somethings. Concerning each he was enthusiastic, slangy, and familiar.
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta paid little attention to slang or enthusiasm; the familiarity
      she ignored utterly. She selected several of the novelties, a rather
      extensive line of Christmas cards, and in the matters of price and cash
      discounts was keen and businesslike. Keith watched and listened, at first
      with amusement, then with growing admiration for the girl&rsquo;s simplicity and
      good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kron&rsquo;s admiration was outspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, as he repacked his samples, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a mighty clever buyer,
      do you know it? That line of stuff you&rsquo;ve ordered is the cream, that&rsquo;s
      what it is. You made a mistake in not layin&rsquo; in a dozen or two of those
      combination beauty-boxes, but that&rsquo;s all right. Here, have one for
      yourself. Take it with my compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta declined. &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It don&rsquo;t come out of my pocket. The firm expects me to hand out
      little keepsakes like that. I&rsquo;ve been plantin&rsquo; &lsquo;em with the girls all the
      way down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kron, having finished his business as representative of Messrs.
      Bernstein, Goldberg and Baun, attempted a stroke of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a little spare time on my hands this evenin&rsquo;; I
      shan&rsquo;t make the next town until tomorrow. There&rsquo;s a new movie theater just
      opened over to Orham. They tell me it&rsquo;s all to the mustard. I can hire a
      rig here and you and me might drive over tonight and take it in. What do
      you say, Kid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away to enter the order she had just given in a book on the
      desk. Mr. Kron tried again, but she did not appear to hear him. He
      grinned, observed &ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; and, with a wink at Mr. Keith, went
      out, a suitcase in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keith rose from the chair and, walking over to the counter, requested to
      be supplied with the tobacco he had come to buy. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta gave it to
      him. Her cheeks were red and Keith was surprised to notice that she looked
      almost as if she would like to cry. He guessed the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young man will get himself thoroughly kicked some day,&rdquo; he observed;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I oughtn&rsquo;t to have done it myself just now. He annoyed
      you, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta answered without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m foolish, I guess. He meant to be nice,
      perhaps. Some girls may like that sort of niceness; I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell him to get out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see his samples. It is time for us to buy our Christmas
      things and I had rather choose them myself, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But Mr. Hamilton or the Captain&mdash;I should think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they might have bought some that we couldn&rsquo;t sell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beauty-boxes, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta smiled. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. But it was rather an ordeal for you. Do you have to endure much of
      that sort of thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than any girl who keeps store, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the dinner table that evening Keith referred to his experience as
      listener in Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl with the queer name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a niece of those two old chaps
      who run the place, I believe she is. Do you know anything about her,
      Gertrude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mrs. Keith could reply, Edna spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Sam, Dad,&rdquo; she said, mischievously. &ldquo;Sam knows about her. He just
      adores that store; he spends half his time there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Edna!&rdquo; protested Sam, turning red. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. And you know about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta too. He says she&rsquo;s a
      peach, Daddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted her brother, indignantly. &ldquo;Well, she is one. She&rsquo;s got
      every girl in your set skinned a mile for looks. But I don&rsquo;t know anything
      about her, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Keith broke in. &ldquo;Skinned a mile!&rdquo; she repeated, with a shudder. &ldquo;Sam,
      what language you do use! Yes, John,&rdquo; she added, addressing her husband.
      &ldquo;I know the girl well. She&rsquo;s pretty and she is sensible. For a girl who
      has had no opportunities and has lived all her life here in South Harniss
      she is really quite remarkable. Why do you speak of her, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keith related a part of the conversation between Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and Mr.
      Kron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She handled the fellow splendidly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She talked business with
      him and she wouldn&rsquo;t let him talk anything else. But it was plain enough
      to see that she felt insulted and angry. It seems a pity that a girl like
      that should have to put up with that sort of thing. I wonder if her
      uncles, old Mr. Hamilton and Captain Shadrach, realize what happens when
      they&rsquo;re not about? How would they take it, do you think, if I dropped a
      hint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edna laughed. &ldquo;You would have to be very careful, Daddy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr.
      Hamilton and the Captain idolize Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and she just worships them.
      Besides, she isn&rsquo;t really their niece, you know. She is a young lady of
      independent means&mdash;at least, so everybody says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father was surprised. He asked what she meant by &ldquo;independent means.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Keith answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The means are not very extensive, I imagine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The story is
      that this Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;why they persist in calling her by that
      dreadful name I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;is the daughter of a former friend
      and partner. Mr. Hamilton and Captain Gould adopted her and she has lived
      with them ever since. She has money of her own, though no two of the
      townspeople agree as to how much. I&rsquo;ve heard it estimated all the way from
      five to fifty thousand. She never speaks of it and those queer old uncles
      of hers keep their affairs very much to themselves. But I agree with you,
      John; it is a shame that she should have to spend her life here in South
      Harniss. I think we ought to do something for her, if we can. I shall
      think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Keith was always doing something for somebody. At home in Chicago she
      was president of her women&rsquo;s club and identified with goodness knows how
      many charitable societies. In South Harniss she was active in church and
      sewing circles. Her enthusiasm was always great, but her tact was
      sometimes lacking. South Harniss people, some of them, were inclined to
      consider her as a self-appointed boss interfering where she had no
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband looked a trifle dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, Gertrude,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;Look out you don&rsquo;t offend. These
      Cape Codders are self-respecting and touchy, you know. Anyone interfering
      with their private affairs is likely to get into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife resented the warning. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw cold water on everything,
      John,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know more about Cape Codders than you do. You only
      meet them for a few weeks each summer. I flatter myself that I know them
      and that they know and trust me. Of COURSE I shall be careful. And I shall
      think the Mary-&rsquo;Gusta matter over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did think it over and a week later she came to her husband overflowing
      with the excitement of a brilliant idea. A cousin of hers, a maiden lady
      of sixty or thereabouts, wealthy and a semi-invalid who cherished her
      ill-health, was in need of a female companion. Mrs. Keith was certain that
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta would be just the person to fill that need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Keith was by no means so certain. He raised some objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, Gertrude, to be frank, I don&rsquo;t think much of the
      scheme. Cousin Clara has had one companion after the other for thirty
      years. None of them has stayed with her very long. She requires a sort of
      combination friend and lady&rsquo;s maid and secretary and waitress, and I don&rsquo;t
      think our Mary-&rsquo;Gusta would enjoy that sort of job. I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;with
      Clara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was indignant. &ldquo;I might have known you would be ready with the
      cold water,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Clara is&mdash;well, cranky, and particular
      and all that, but the opportunity is wonderful. The girl would travel and
      meet the best people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might remove their wraps, I admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! And if Clara took a fancy to her she might leave her a good sum
      of money when she died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, providing the girl didn&rsquo;t die first. No, Gertrude, I&rsquo;m sorry to
      disappoint you, but I don&rsquo;t think much of your idea. Anyway, according to
      my belief, you&rsquo;re approaching this thing from the wrong end. It isn&rsquo;t the
      girl herself you should try to influence, but her uncles, or guardians, or
      whatever they are. If I know her, and I&rsquo;ve been making some inquiries, she
      won&rsquo;t leave them. She will consider that they need her at the house and
      store and she&rsquo;ll stay. They are the ones to influence. If the matter of
      her welfare and future was put to them in the right light they might&mdash;well,
      they might sacrifice themselves to benefit her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! I know I&rsquo;m right. She&rsquo;ll jump at the opportunity. I shall tell
      her about it this very afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t accept; I&rsquo;ll bet on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His principal reason for non-belief in Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s acceptance was his
      knowledge of his wife&rsquo;s lack of tact. The girl did not consider herself,
      nor was she, a subject of charity. And the position of combination friend
      and servant would not appeal to her. John Keith had an idea of his own
      concerning Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, but it could wait until his wife&rsquo;s had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It failed, of course, and Mrs. Keith, that evening, was indignant and
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was so treated in my life,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;That girl didn&rsquo;t know
      her place at all. I&rsquo;m through. I wash my hands of the whole matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she polite?&rdquo; inquired Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was polite enough, as far as that goes, but she wouldn&rsquo;t even
      consider my proposal. Wouldn&rsquo;t even hear me through. She said she had no
      thought of leaving South Harniss. She was quite satisfied and contented
      where she was. One would think I had come to ask a favor instead of
      conferring one. Why, she seemed to think my plan almost ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course she didn&rsquo;t. She thanked me and all that; but she snubbed me
      just the same. I&rsquo;m disgusted. I&rsquo;m through&mdash;absolutely and completely
      through trying to help that girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith did not say, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;; in fact, he said little or nothing
      more at the time. But a day or two afterwards he called at the store.
      Zoeth and Captain Shadrach were alone there, their niece having gone down
      to the house, a fact of which the caller was aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partners liked John Keith. They considered him, as Captain Shad said,
      &ldquo;a first-rate, everyday sort of feller,&rdquo; who did not patronize nor put on
      airs, even though he was a &ldquo;summer man&rdquo; and rich. When he talked with them
      it was of things they understood, local affairs, the cranberry crop,
      fishing, and the doings of the Board of Selectmen. He was willing to
      listen as well as talk and he did not refer to permanent residents as
      &ldquo;natives,&rdquo; a habit of his wife&rsquo;s which irritated the Captain extremely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire!&rdquo; said the latter on one occasion, &ldquo;every time that woman
      calls us town folks &lsquo;natives&rsquo; I feel as if she cal&rsquo;lated I lived up a tree
      and chucked coconuts at folks. I don&rsquo;t wonder some of the South Sea
      Islands heathen eat missionaries. If I ATE that woman she might agree with
      me; she don&rsquo;t as &lsquo;tis. Every time I say yes she says no, and that makes me
      think yes harder&rsquo;n ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Keith was not popular with the South Harniss natives, perhaps
      because she tried so hard to be; her husband, who apparently did not try
      to be, was. He and his opinions were liked and respected. When he came
      into the store, therefore, on this occasion, Zoeth and Shad welcomed him,
      asked him to sit down, and the conversation began with the astonishing
      rise in the price of sea-front property and drifted from that to other
      timely and general topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how it drifted to Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and her future neither of the partners
      could have told&mdash;however, drift there it did, and they found
      themselves chanting her praises to their caller, who seemed much
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a remarkably capable girl,&rdquo; observed Mr. Keith. &ldquo;And before we
      realize it she will be a young woman. Are you planning that she shall keep
      store and keep house for you the rest of her life, or the rest of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth shook his head. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, mildly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve
      planned much about it so fur. Those things sort of take care of
      themselves, always seemed to me. Or the Almighty takes care of &lsquo;em for
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their visitor smiled. &ldquo;Someone else will be willing and anxious to take
      care of her before many years, or I miss my guess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is
      likely to marry, you know. There must be some promising young fellows down
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach sniffed. It was a subject he never discussed with his partner and
      did not like even to think about. The remark of the hat and cap drummer
      concerning the coming of a &ldquo;Mr. Right&rdquo; had troubled him not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he grunted; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s promisin&rsquo; ones enough. Most of those that are
      contented to stay here in South Harniss are nothin&rsquo; BUT promise; they
      ain&rsquo;t so strong on makin&rsquo; good. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t like &lsquo;twas when Zoeth and me were
      young ourselves. Now all the smart, ambitious boys go up to the city to
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the girls go up there, too, don&rsquo;t they? To school, or college?
      Didn&rsquo;t I hear that Christopher Mullet&rsquo;s daughter was at school in
      Bridgewater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; grunted Shadrach again. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you did hear. If you didn&rsquo;t
      you&rsquo;re the only one in town that ain&rsquo;t. Becky Mullet&mdash;yes, and Chris,
      too&mdash;ain&rsquo;t done anything but brag about their Irene&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; off to
      what they call &lsquo;finishin&rsquo; school.&rsquo; Judas! I see HER finish. She ain&rsquo;t got&mdash;I
      swan that girl ain&rsquo;t got anything in her head but gas, and every time she
      opens her mouth she loses enough of that to keep a lighthouse lit up all
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; murmured Zoeth, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say such unlikely things about folks.
      Be charitable as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas! I am&mdash;as much as I can. If I wasn&rsquo;t charitable to that Mullet
      girl I&rsquo;d be talkin&rsquo; yet. I hove to afore I&rsquo;d got scarcely under way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith put in a word. &ldquo;Finishing schools are not all bad, by any means,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;There are various kinds and grades, of course, but a good private
      school for girls is a fine thing. It teaches them to meet and judge people
      of all kinds, and that fine feathers don&rsquo;t always make fine birds. Then,
      too, a girl at a good school of that sort is under strict discipline and
      her acquaintances, male acquaintances especially, are chosen with care.
      Sixteen to eighteen is a dangerous age for the average girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;did your niece tell you of her experience with
      that traveling salesman the other day, the fellow selling Christmas
      novelties? No? Well, I happened to be here at the time. It was rather
      interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s session with Mr. Kron. The partners listened with
      growing indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by the jumpin&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Shad. &ldquo;Did you ever hear such
      brassy talk in your life! I wish to thunder I&rsquo;d been here. There&rsquo;d have
      been one mighty sick patient ready for the doctor and he wouldn&rsquo;t have
      been a South Harniss native either. But Mary-&rsquo;Gusta didn&rsquo;t take none of
      his sauce, I tell you; that girl of ours is all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is all right. But she didn&rsquo;t enjoy the experience, that was
      plain enough, and, so far as I can see, she is likely to have a good many
      others of the same kind. Now it isn&rsquo;t my business, I know that; you can
      tell me to shut up and clear out any time you like, of course; but do you
      think it is just fair to a girl like your niece to condemn her to a life
      of storekeeping or the alternative of marrying one of the promising young
      men you&rsquo;ve been talking about? Don&rsquo;t you think such a girl as she is
      deserves a chance; every chance you can give her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two partners stared at him open-mouthed. Shadrach, as usual, spoke
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Condemn her?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Condemn Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? A chance? Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach,&rdquo; interrupted Zoeth. &ldquo;Mr. Keith ain&rsquo;t done yet. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; 
      to tell us what he means. Go on, Mr. Keith, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith, having broken the ice, and found the water not so chilly as he had
      feared it might be, plunged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I mean this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I confess frankly that I have been very
      favorably impressed by your niece. She is an unusual girl&mdash;unusually
      pretty, of course, but much more than that. She is simple and brave and
      sensible and frank. If she were my daughter I should be very proud of her.
      I know you are. She should have, it seems to me, the opportunity to make
      the most of her qualities and personality. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about her a
      great deal ever since my call at the store here the other day. Now I&rsquo;ve
      got a suggestion to make. You can take it or leave it, but I assure you it
      is made with the best of intentions and solely in her interest as I see
      it; and I hope you&rsquo;ll take it after you&rsquo;ve thought it over. Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to impart the suggestion. His hearers listened, Zoeth silently
      and Shadrach with occasional mutterings and exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there you are,&rdquo; said Keith in conclusion. &ldquo;The school is a good one,
      one of the best in Boston. Two years there will do worlds for your niece.
      It has done worlds for other girls I have known. It is rather expensive,
      of course, but, as I understand it, Mary has money of her own of which
      you, as her guardians, have charge. She couldn&rsquo;t spend a portion of that
      money to better advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth said nothing, but he looked at the Captain and the Captain looked at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She HAS money of her own, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Keith. &ldquo;I have been
      told she was left an independent fortune by her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another interval of silence. The partners were quite aware of
      the general belief in Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s independent fortune. They had not
      discouraged that belief. It was no one&rsquo;s business but theirs and their
      respect and affection for Marcellus Hall had prevented the disclosure of
      the latter&rsquo;s poverty. That secret not even Mary-&rsquo;Gusta knew; she, too,
      believed that the money which paid for her clothes and board and all the
      rest was her own. Her uncles had helped her to think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when their visitor asked the pointed question Zoeth looked at Shadrach
      and the latter shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; he answered, brusquely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s true enough, I cal&rsquo;late. Marcellus
      left her all he had. But&mdash;but look here, Mr. Keith. Do I understand
      you to advise us to send Mary-&rsquo;Gusta away&mdash;to school&mdash;for two
      years? Jumpin&rsquo; fire! How&mdash;how could we? She&mdash;why, what would we
      do without her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be harder for you here in the store, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The store! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the store I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about; it&rsquo;s me and Zoeth.
      What&rsquo;ll WE do without her? Why, she&mdash;why, no daughter could mean more
      to us than that girl does, and if Zoeth and me was her own&mdash;er&mdash;mother
      and father we couldn&rsquo;t think more of her. We&rsquo;d be adrift and out of sight
      of land if Mary-&rsquo;Gusta went away. No, no, we couldn&rsquo;t think of such a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even for her sake? She&rsquo;s worth a pretty big sacrifice, a girl like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long discussion followed, a discussion interrupted by the arrival of
      occasional customers but resumed as soon as each of these individuals
      departed. Zoeth asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;this Miss&mdash;er&mdash;What&rsquo;s-her-name&rsquo;s school you&rsquo;re
      talkin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;a reg&rsquo;lar boardin&rsquo; school, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there are day pupils. It was my idea, provided you two were
      willing to listen to my suggestion at all, to suggest that Mary attend as
      a day pupil. She might live near the school instead of at it. That would
      be much less expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm,&rdquo; mused Shadrach, &ldquo;but&mdash;but she&rsquo;d have to live somewheres, and
      I for one would want to be mighty particular what sort of a place she
      lived at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Well, I have thought of that, too, and here is suggestion
      number three: I have a cousin&mdash;a cousin of my first wife&rsquo;s&mdash;who
      lives on Pinckney Street, which is not far from the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school.
      This cousin&mdash;Mrs. Wyeth is her name&mdash;is a widow and she hasn&rsquo;t
      too much money. She doesn&rsquo;t keep a boarding house exactly, but she has
      been known to take a few of what she calls &lsquo;paying guests.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s very
      Bostonian and very particular concerning the references and family
      connections of those guests, but I think I could manage that. If your
      niece were placed in her care she would have a real home and meet only the
      sort of people you would wish her to meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might have added that Mrs. Wyeth, being under many obligations,
      pecuniary and otherwise, to her wealthy Chicago relative, would need only
      a hint from him to give Mary-&rsquo;Gusta the care and attention of a parent, a
      very particular, Boston first-family parent. But, unlike his present wife,
      he was not in the habit of referring to his charities, so he kept this
      information to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth sighed. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re mighty kind in all this, Mr.
      Keith. I know that you&rsquo;re sartin this goin&rsquo; away to school would do
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta a sight of good. But&mdash;but I swan I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t hardly
      bear to think of our lettin&rsquo; her go away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that. Just think it over and we&rsquo;ll have another talk
      later.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Keith and the Captain had that later talk&mdash;several talks, in fact&mdash;and
      a week after their first one Captain Shadrach suddenly announced that he
      was cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to run up to Boston just for a day on business and that
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had better go along with him for company. Zoeth could tend
      store and get along all right until they returned. The girl was not so
      certain of the getting along all right, but Mr. Hamilton as well as the
      Captain insisted, so she consented at last. The Boston trip was not
      exactly a novelty to her&mdash;she had visited the city a number of times
      during the past few years&mdash;but a holiday with Uncle Shad was always
      good fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the early morning train and reached Boston about ten o&rsquo;clock.
      Shadrach&rsquo;s business in the city seemed to be of a rather vague nature this
      time. They called at the offices of two or three of his old friends&mdash;ship-chandlers
      and marine outfitters on Commercial Street and Atlantic Avenue&mdash;and
      then the Captain, looking at his watch, announced that it was pretty nigh
      noontime and he cal&rsquo;lated they had better be cruisin&rsquo; up towards Pinckney
      Street. &ldquo;Got an errand up in that latitude,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pinckney Street was on the hill in the rear of the Common and the State
      House and was narrow and crooked and old-fashioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world are we doing up here?&rdquo; queried Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. &ldquo;There
      aren&rsquo;t any wholesale houses here, I&rsquo;m sure. Haven&rsquo;t you made a mistake,
      Uncle Shad?&rdquo; Shadrach, who had been consulting a page of his pocket
      memorandum book, replied that he cal&rsquo;lated he&rsquo;d got his bearin&rsquo;s, and, to
      the girl&rsquo;s astonishment, stopped before a brick dwelling with a colonial
      doorway and a white stone step which actually shone from scrubbing, and
      rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid who answered the bell wore a white apron which crackled with
      starch. She looked as if she too had, like the step, been scrubbed a few
      minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is No.&mdash;, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; inquired the Captain. &ldquo;Humph! I thought
      so. I ain&rsquo;t so much of a wreck yet but that I can navigate Boston without
      a pilot. Is Mr. Keith in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid, who had received the pilot statement with uncomprehending
      astonishment, looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Keith&rsquo;s here. Are you the ones he&rsquo;s expectin&rsquo;?
      Walk in, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house. It was as spotlessly tidy within as without. The
      maid ushered them into a parlor where old mahogany and old family
      portraits in oil were very much in evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, please,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Keith you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta turned to the Captain in amazed agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;why on earth did you come HERE to see Mr.
      Keith? Couldn&rsquo;t you have seen him at South Harniss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head. &ldquo;Not today I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up here
      today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you want to see him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, business, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Mr. Keith and me are tryin&rsquo; to do a
      little stroke of business together. We&rsquo;ve got a hen on, as the feller
      said. Say, this is kind of a swell house, ain&rsquo;t it? And clean&mdash;my
      soul! Judas! did I move this chair out of place? I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Looks
      as if it had set right in that one spot for a hundred years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith entered at that moment, followed by an elderly lady whose gown was
      almost as old-fashioned as the furniture. She was a rather thin person but
      her face, although sharp, was not unkind in expression and her plainly
      arranged hair was white. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta liked her looks; she guessed that she
      might be very nice indeed to people she knew and fancied; also that she
      would make certain of knowing them first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Captain Gould,&rdquo; hailed Keith. &ldquo;Glad to see you. Found the place
      all right, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I found it, Mr. Keith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t have any difficulty. Mary, how do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and Mr. Keith shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Keith, &ldquo;I want to introduce you to my cousin, Mrs. Wyeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth bowed with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Captain Gould,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I&rsquo;m pretty smart, thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; stammered Shadrach,
      rather embarrassed at all this ceremony. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this young lady,&rdquo; went on Keith, &ldquo;is Miss Mary Lathrop. Miss Lathrop,
      this lady is Mrs. Wyeth, my cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, with the uneasy feeling that Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s gaze had been fixed
      upon her since she entered the room, bowed but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Keith, heartily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have luncheon. You&rsquo;re just in
      time and Mrs. Wyeth has been expecting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain&rsquo;s embarrassment reached its height at this invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;we&mdash;we can&rsquo;t do that. Couldn&rsquo;t think of it,
      you know. We&mdash;we ain&rsquo;t a mite hungry. Had breakfast afore we left
      home, didn&rsquo;t we, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith laughed. &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you left home about half-past
      five. I&rsquo;ve taken that early train myself. If you&rsquo;re not hungry you ought
      to be and luncheon is ready. Emily&mdash;Mrs. Wyeth&mdash;has been
      expecting you. She will be disappointed if you refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth herself put in a word here. &ldquo;Of course they won&rsquo;t refuse,
      John,&rdquo; she said with decision. &ldquo;They must be famished. Refuse! The idea!
      Captain Gould, Mr. Keith will look out for you; your niece will come with
      me. Luncheon will be ready in five minutes. Come, Mary. That&rsquo;s your name&mdash;Mary&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      it? I&rsquo;m glad to hear it. It&rsquo;s plain and it&rsquo;s sensible and I like it. The
      employment bureau sent me a maid a week ago and when she told me her name
      I sent her back again. It was Florina. That was enough. Mercy! All I could
      think of was a breakfast food. Come, Mary. Now, John, do be prompt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That luncheon took its place in Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s memory beside that of her
      first supper in the house at South Harniss. They were both memorable
      meals, although alike in no other respects. Mrs. Wyeth presided, of
      course, and she asked the blessing and poured the tea with dignity and
      businesslike dispatch. The cups and saucers were of thin, transparent
      China, with pictures of mandarins and pagodas upon them. They looked
      old-fashioned and they were; Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s grandfather had bought them
      himself in Hongkong in the days when he commanded a clipper ship and made
      voyages to the Far East. The teaspoons were queer little fiddle-patterned
      affairs; they were made by an ancestor who was a silversmith with a shop
      on Cornhill before General Gage&rsquo;s army was quartered in Boston. And cups
      and spoons and napkins were so clean that it seemed almost sacrilegious to
      soil them by use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach did not soil his to any great extent at first. The
      Captain was plainly overawed by the genteel elegance of his surrounding
      and the manner of his hostess. But Mr. Keith was very much at ease and
      full of fun and, after a time, a little of Shadrach&rsquo;s self-consciousness
      disappeared. When he learned that grandfather Wyeth had been a seafaring
      man he came out of his shell sufficiently to narrate, at Keith&rsquo;s request,
      one of his own experiences in Hongkong, but even in the midst of his yarn
      he never forgot to address his hostess as &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am&rdquo; and he did not say
      &ldquo;Jumpin Judas&rdquo; once.
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon Mr. Keith and the Captain left the house together. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; 
      to attend to that little mite of business I spoke to you about,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; explained Shadrach, confidentially. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back pretty
      soon. I cal&rsquo;late maybe you&rsquo;d better wait here, that is,&rdquo; with a glance at
      Mrs. Wyeth, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;ll be all right for you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it will be all right,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Wyeth promptly. &ldquo;I shall
      be glad to have her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am. If she won&rsquo;t be in the way I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were likely to be in the way I should say so. She won&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; stammered Shadrach. &ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he and Mr. Keith were out of the house he drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas!&rdquo; he observed, feelingly. &ldquo;Say, that cousin of yours don&rsquo;t waste
      any words, does she? When it comes to speakin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s in her mind she
      don&rsquo;t fool around none. She&rsquo;s as right up and down as a schooner&rsquo;s
      fo&rsquo;mast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith laughed heartily. &ldquo;Emily is blunt and outspoken,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
      prides herself on that. But she is as square as a brick. She never says
      one thing to your face and another behind your back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&mdash;I judge that&rsquo;s so. Well, that&rsquo;s all right; I ain&rsquo;t got any
      objections to that way of talkin&rsquo; myself. But say, if every woman was like
      her there wouldn&rsquo;t be many sewin&rsquo; circles, would there? The average sewin&rsquo; 
      circle meetin&rsquo; is one part sew and three parts what So-and-so said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the little mite of business had been transacted and the pair returned
      to the Wyeth house they found Mrs. Wyeth and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta awaiting them in
      the parlor. The girl had the feeling that she had been undergoing a rather
      vigorous cross-examination. Mrs. Wyeth had not talked a great deal herself
      and her manner, though brusque and matter of fact, was kind; but she had
      asked questions about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s home life, about Captain Gould and Mr.
      Hamilton, about school and friends and acquaintances. And her comments,
      when she made any, were direct and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Mr. Keith exchanged looks when the latter entered the room. Keith
      raised his eyebrows inquiringly. She nodded as if giving emphatic assent
      to his unspoken question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta left the house soon afterward. While the Captain
      and Mr. Keith were whispering together in the hall, Mrs. Wyeth bade the
      girl good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you, my dear,&rdquo; said the lady. &ldquo;You seem to be a sweet, sensible
      girl, and I don&rsquo;t meet as many of that kind nowadays as I could wish. I am
      sure we shall be good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And WHAT did she mean by that?&rdquo; demanded Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, as she and the
      Captain walked along Pinckney Street together. &ldquo;Why should we be good
      friends? Probably I&rsquo;ll never meet her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach smiled. &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t always tell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sometimes you meet
      folks oftener&rsquo;n you think in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta looked at him. &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what does all this
      mean, anyway? Why did you go to her house? And what was the mysterious
      business of yours with Mr. Keith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a hen on, same as I told you,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time for the critter to come off the nest you&rsquo;ll see
      what&rsquo;s been hatched same as the rest of us. How&rsquo;d you like that Mrs.
      Wyeth? Had a pretty sharp edge on her tongue, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta considered. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;she was outspoken and blunt,
      of course. But she is a lady&mdash;a real lady, I think&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure
      I should like her very much when I knew her better. I think, though, that
      she would expect a person to behave&mdash;behave in her way, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas! I should say so. Don&rsquo;t talk! I ain&rsquo;t felt so much as if I was
      keepin&rsquo; my toes on a chalk mark since I went to school. I don&rsquo;t know what
      her husband died of, but I&rsquo;ll bet &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t curvature of the spine. If he
      didn&rsquo;t stand up straight &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t his wife&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s curiosity concerning the mysterious business which had
      brought them to the city became greater than ever before it was time to
      take the train for home. Apparently all of that business, whatever it
      might be, had been transacted when her uncle and Mr. Keith took their
      short walk together after luncheon. Captain Shadrach seemed to consider
      his Boston errand done and the pair spent half of the hour before train
      time wandering along Tremont and Washington Streets looking into shop
      windows, and the other half in the waiting room of the South Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great and growing as was her curiosity, the girl asked no more questions.
      She was determined not to ask them. And the Captain, neither while in the
      city nor during the homeward journey, referred to the &ldquo;hen&rdquo; in which he
      and his friend from Chicago were mutually interested. It was not until
      nine o&rsquo;clock that evening, when supper was over and Zoeth, having locked
      up the store, was with them in the sitting-room, that the hitherto
      secretive fowl came off the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shadrach, having given his partner a look and received one in return,
      cleared his throat and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;me and your Uncle Zoeth have got some news for
      you. I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ve been wonderin&rsquo; a little mite what that business of
      Mr. Keith&rsquo;s and mine was, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta smiled. &ldquo;I have wondered&mdash;just a little,&rdquo; she observed,
      with mild sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I ain&rsquo;t surprised. Well, the business is done and it&rsquo;s
      settled, and it&rsquo;s about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me? Why, Uncle Shad! How can it be about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause it can and it is, that&rsquo;s why. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, me and Zoeth have been
      thinkin&rsquo; about you a good deal lately and we&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion
      that we ain&rsquo;t treated you just right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t treated me right? YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, us. You&rsquo;re a good girl and a smart girl&mdash;the smartest and best
      girl there is in this town. A girl like that ought to do somethin&rsquo; 
      better&rsquo;n than stay here in South Harniss and keep store. Keepin&rsquo; store&rsquo;s
      all right for old hulks like Zoeth Hamilton and Shad Gould, but you ain&rsquo;t
      an old hulk; you&rsquo;re a young craft right off the ways and you ought to have
      a chance to cruise in the best water there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad, what are you talking about? Cruise in the best water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said. You ought to mix with the best folks and get a fine
      education and meet somebody besides drummers and&mdash;and Sol Higgins&rsquo;s
      son. Selling coffins may be a good job, I don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t; somebody&rsquo;s
      got to do it and we&rsquo;ll all have to invest in that kind of&mdash;er&mdash;furniture
      sometime or &lsquo;nother. And Dan Higgins is a good enough boy, too. But he
      ain&rsquo;t your kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My kind! Uncle Shad, what in the world have I got to do with Dan Higgins
      and coffins&mdash;and all the rest of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo; at all. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m tryin&rsquo; to tell you if you&rsquo;ll
      give me a chance. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, your Uncle Zoeth and I have decided that
      you must go to school up to Boston, at the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school there.
      You&rsquo;ll board along with that Mrs. Wyeth, the one we met today. She&rsquo;s a
      good woman, I cal&rsquo;late, though she is so everlastin&rsquo; straight up and down.
      You&rsquo;ll board there and you&rsquo;ll go to school to those Cabot women. And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary-&rsquo;Gusta interrupted. The hen was off the nest now, there was no
      doubt of that, and of all unexpected and impossible hatchings hers was the
      most complete. The absurdity of the idea, to the girl&rsquo;s mind, overshadowed
      even the surprise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Uncle Shad, what&mdash;? Do you mean that you and Uncle
      Zoeth have been in conspiracy to send me away to school? To send me away
      to Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No conspiracy about it,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Me and Zoeth and Mr. Keith, we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Keith? Yes, yes, I see. It was Mr. Keith who put the idea in your
      head. How perfectly silly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly? Why is it silly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s common sense. Other girls go to city finishin&rsquo; 
      schools, don&rsquo;t they? That Irene Mullet&rsquo;s just gone, for one. Don&rsquo;t you
      think we figger to do as much for our girl as Becky Mullet can do for
      hers? Jumpin&rsquo; fire! If you ain&rsquo;t worth a hogshead of girls like Irene
      Mullet then I miss my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Uncle Shad; what difference does that make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now Zoeth put in a word. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know what a good
      school like the one Shad&rsquo;s been speakin&rsquo; of can do for a girl. I know you
      know it. Now, be right down honest; wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have a couple of
      years, say, at a school like that, if you could have &lsquo;em just as well as
      not? Didn&rsquo;t you say not more&rsquo;n a fortni&rsquo;t ago that you was glad Irene
      Mullet was goin&rsquo; to have such a chance to improve herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had said that very thing; she could not truthfully deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;And I am glad. But Irene&rsquo;s case and mine
      are different. Irene isn&rsquo;t needed at home. I am, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach broke in. &ldquo;Ah, ha! Ah, ha! Zoeth,&rdquo; he crowed, triumphantly.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you she&rsquo;d say that? I knew she&rsquo;d say she wouldn&rsquo;t go &lsquo;cause
      she&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d ought to stay here and look out for us. Well,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, you listen to me. Zoeth and I are your guardians, lawfully
      appointed. We&rsquo;re your bosses, young lady, for a spell yet. And you&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to do as we say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t any &lsquo;buts.&rsquo; The &lsquo;buts&rsquo; are all past and gone. Mr. Keith has
      arranged for you to board and room along with Mrs. Wyeth and I&rsquo;ve arranged
      for your schoolin&rsquo; at the Cabot place. Yes, and I&rsquo;ve done more&rsquo;n that: I
      paid for your first year&rsquo;s schoolin&rsquo; this very afternoon. So there! THAT&rsquo;S
      ended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not ended, of course. Mary-&rsquo;Gusta went to her room that night
      declaring she would not leave her uncles to attend any finishing school.
      They went to theirs vowing that she should. The real end came the next day
      when Zoeth put the subject before her in a new light by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta; just listen to me a minute and think. Suppose the
      boot was on t&rsquo;other foot: suppose you wanted us to do somethin&rsquo; to please
      you, you&rsquo;d expect us to do it, wouldn&rsquo;t you? Anyhow, you know mighty well
      we WOULD do it. Now we want you to do this to please us. We&rsquo;ve set our
      hearts on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was silent for a minute or more. The partners watched her
      anxiously. Then she asked an unusual question, one concerning her own
      financial status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I afford it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have I money enough of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth looked troubled. Shadrach, however, answered promptly and
      diplomatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Zoeth and me are your guardians? And
      didn&rsquo;t I say we&rsquo;d gone into the thing careful and deliberate? And didn&rsquo;t I
      pay your first year&rsquo;s schoolin&rsquo; yesterday? Don&rsquo;t that alone show what we
      think about the money. Be still, Zoeth; that&rsquo;s enough. Well, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta considered a moment longer. Then she rose and, crossing the
      room, gave them each a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; she said, simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go because I think you mean it and that
      it will please you. For that reason and no other I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school was to open on the fifteenth of September and,
      on the morning of the fourteenth, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta bade her guardians good-by
      on the platform of the South Harniss railway station. Shadrach had
      intended going to Boston with her, but she had firmly insisted on going
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get used to being away from you both,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you must get
      used to having me go. It will be best for all of us to say good-by here.
      It won&rsquo;t be for VERY long; I&rsquo;ll be home at Christmas, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three weeks prior to the fateful fourteenth had been crowded with
      activities. Twice the girl and Captain Shadrach had journeyed to Boston,
      where in company with Mrs. Wyeth, whose services had been volunteered in a
      crisp but kindly note, they visited shops and selected and purchased&mdash;that
      is, the feminine members of the party selected and the Captain paid for&mdash;a
      suit and waists and hats and other things which it appeared were necessary
      for the wardrobe of a young lady at finishing school. Shadrach would have
      bought lavishly, but Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s common sense guided the selections and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was very particular as to price. Shadrach, at the beginning,
      made a few suggestions concerning colors and styles, but the suggestions
      were disregarded. The Captain&rsquo;s taste in colors was not limited; he
      fancied almost any hue, provided it was bright enough. His ward would have
      looked like an animated crazy quilt if he had had his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grumbled a little as they journeyed back to South Harniss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be all right, that Wyeth woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s too
      everlastin&rsquo; sober-sided to suit me. Take that hat you and she bought; why,
      &lsquo;twas as plain, and hadn&rsquo;t no more fuss and feathers than a minister&rsquo;s
      wife&rsquo;s bonnet. You ain&rsquo;t an old maid; no, nor a Boston first-family widow,
      neither. Now, the hat I liked&mdash;the yellow and blue one&mdash;had some
      get-up-and-git. If you wore that out on Tremont Street folks would turn
      around and look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta laughed and squeezed his hand. &ldquo;You silly Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know that is exactly what I don&rsquo;t want them to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach turned his gaze in her direction. She was at the end of the car
      seat next to the window and against the light of the setting sun her face
      and head were silhouetted in dainty profile. The Captain sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, philosophically, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we need to argue. I
      cal&rsquo;late they&rsquo;ll look some as &lsquo;tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her parting instructions to her uncles were many and diversified. Zoeth
      must be sure and change to his heavy flannels on the first of October. He
      must not forget rubbers when the ground was damp, and an umbrella when it
      rained. If he caught cold there was the medicine Doctor Harley had
      prescribed. He must not sit up after ten o&rsquo;clock; he must not try to read
      the paper without first hunting for his spectacles. These were a few of
      his orders. Shadrach&rsquo;s list was even longer. It included going to church
      every other Sunday: keeping his Sunday shoes blacked: not forgetting to
      change his collar every morning: to get his hair cut at least once in six
      weeks: not to eat pie just before going to bed, &ldquo;because you know if you
      do, you always have the nightmare and groan and moan and wake up everyone
      but yourself&rdquo;: not to say &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Creepin&rsquo; Judas&rdquo; any oftener than
      he could help: to be sure and not cut prices in the store just because a
      customer asked him to do so&mdash;and goodness knows how much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Isaiah Chase, his list was so lengthy and varied that the
      responsibility quite overwhelmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gosh t&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo; exclaimed Isaiah, desperately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never be able to
      live up to all them sailin&rsquo; orders and I know it. I&rsquo;ve put some of &lsquo;em
      down on a piece of paper, but I ain&rsquo;t even got them straight, and as for
      the million or two others&mdash;whew! I&rsquo;m to dust every day, and sweep
      every other day, and change the tablecloth, and see that the washin&rsquo; goes
      when it ought to, and feed the horse the cat&mdash;no, no, feed the cat
      oats&mdash;Oh, consarn it! Feed the cat and the horse and the hens their
      reg&rsquo;lar vittles at reg&rsquo;lar times and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, my soul! Yes, and
      let alone my own self and all that&rsquo;s laid onto me, I must keep an eye on
      Captain Shad and Zoeth and see that they do what&rsquo;s been laid onto THEM. I
      swan to man! I&rsquo;m a hard-workin&rsquo;, painstakin&rsquo; feller of my age, but I ain&rsquo;t
      as young as I used to be, and I&rsquo;m human and not a walkin&rsquo; steam-engyne.
      I&rsquo;ll do the best I can, but&mdash;but first thing you know I&rsquo;ll be drove
      into heavin&rsquo; up my job. THEN this craft&rsquo;ll be on its beam ends, I bet you!
      They&rsquo;ll appreciate me then, when it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farewells at the railway station were brief. They were very hard to
      say and neither the partners nor Mary-&rsquo;Gusta could trust themselves to
      talk more than was necessary. The train drew up beside the platform; then
      it moved on. A hand waved from the car window; Shadrach and Zoeth waved in
      return. The rear car disappeared around the curve by Solomon Higgins&rsquo; 
      cranberry shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach echoed the sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I feel as if the best part of you and me
      had gone along with her. Well, t&rsquo;other parts have got to go back to the
      store and wait on customers, I presume likely. Heave ahead and let&rsquo;s do
      it. Ah, hum! I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d ought to be thankful we&rsquo;ve got work to do,
      Zoeth. It&rsquo;ll help take up our minds. There are goin&rsquo; to be lonesome days
      for you and me, shipmate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were lonely days for Mary-&rsquo;Gusta also, those of that first month at
      Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s and at the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school. For the first time in her
      life she realized what it meant to be homesick. But in the letters which
      she wrote to her uncles not a trace of the homesickness was permitted to
      show and little by little its keenest pangs wore away. She, too, was
      thankful for work, for the study which kept her from thinking of other
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Misses Cabot&mdash;their Christian names were Priscilla and Hortense&mdash;she
      found to be middle-aged maiden ladies, eminently prim and proper, and the
      educational establishment over which they presided a sort of Protestant
      nunnery ruled according to the precepts of the Congregational Church and
      the New England aristocracy. Miss Priscilla was tall and thin and her
      favorite author was Emerson; she quoted Emerson extensively and was
      certain that real literature died when he did. Miss Hortense was younger,
      plumper, and more romantic. She quoted Longfellow and occasionally Oliver
      Wendell Holmes, although she admitted she considered the latter rather too
      frivolous at times. Both sisters were learned, dignified, and strict
      disciplinarians. Also, in the eyes of both a male person younger than
      forty-five was labeled &ldquo;Danger&mdash;Keep Away.&rdquo; But one creature of the
      masculine gender taught in their school; he was white-haired Doctor
      Barnes, professor of the dead languages. It was the prevailing opinion
      among the scholars that Doctor Barnes, when at home, occupied an apartment
      in the Greek Antiquity section of the Art Museum, where he slept and ate
      surrounded by the statues and busts of his contemporaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the scholars themselves, there were about forty of them, girls&mdash;or
      young ladies: the Misses Cabot invariably referred to and addressed them
      as &ldquo;young ladies&rdquo;&mdash;from Boston and New York and Philadelphia, even
      from Chicago and as far south as Baltimore. Almost all were the daughters
      of well-to-do parents, almost all had their homes in cities. There were
      very few who, like Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, had lived all their lives in the country.
      Some were pretty, some were not; some were giddy and giggly, some solemn
      and studious, some either according to mood; some were inclined to be
      snobbish, others simple and &ldquo;everyday.&rdquo; In short, the school was like
      almost any school of its kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta entered this school and, doing so, ceased to be Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,
      becoming Miss Lathrop to her instructors and Mary to her intimates among
      the scholars. And at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s she was Mary or Miss Lathrop or Miss
      Mary, according to the age, length of acquaintance, or station of the
      person addressing her. But she always thought of herself as Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      and her letters written to Uncle Shad or Uncle Zoeth were so signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found, after the hard work of beginning, that she could keep abreast
      of her class in studies without undue exertion. Also she found that, the
      snobs excepted, the girls at the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school were inclined to be
      sociable and friendly. She made no bid for their friendship, being a
      self-respecting young person whose dislike of imitation was as strong as
      ever, but, perhaps because she did not bid or imitate but continued to be
      simply and sincerely herself, friends came to her. Most of these friends
      received monthly allowances far greater than hers, and most of them wore
      more expensive gowns and in greater variety, but she showed no envy nor
      offered apologies, and if she sometimes wished, being human, that her
      wardrobe was a trifle more extensive she kept that wish to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her liking for Mrs. Wyeth grew into a real affection. And the prim and
      practical matron grew more and more fond of her. The girl came to be
      considered, and almost to consider herself, one of the family. The
      &ldquo;family&rdquo; consisted of Mrs. Wyeth, Mary, Miss Pease, the other &ldquo;paying
      guest,&rdquo; and Maggie, the maid, and Nora, the cook. Miss Pease was an
      elderly spinster without near relatives, possessed of an income and a love
      of travel which she gratified by occasional European trips. She and her
      closest friend, Mrs. Wyeth, disagreed on many subjects, but they united in
      the belief that Boston was a suburb of Paradise and that William Ellery
      Channing was the greatest of religious leaders. They at-tended the
      Arlington Street Unitarian Church, and Mary often accompanied them there
      for Sunday morning or afternoon service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conviction of the Misses Cabot that youthful manhood was dangerous and
      to be shunned like the plague Mary soon discovered was not shared by the
      majority of the young ladies. If Miss Priscilla and Miss Hortense had had
      their way Harvard University and the Institute of Technology would have
      been moved forthwith to some remote spot like the North Pole or San
      Francisco. There were altogether too many &ldquo;cousins&rdquo; or &ldquo;sons of old family
      friends&rdquo; calling at the school to deliver messages from parents or
      guardians or the said friends. These messengers, young gentlemen with
      budding mustaches and full-blown raiment, were rigidly inspected and their
      visits carefully chaperoned: but letters came and were treasured and the
      cheerful inanity of their contents imparted, in strict secrecy, to bosom
      friends of the recipients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary received no such letters. No cousins or family friends called to
      deliver messages to her. No photographs of young fellows in lettered
      sweaters were hidden among her belongings. Her friends in the school
      thought this state of affairs very odd and they sometimes asked pointed
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Barbara Howe, whose home was in Brookline and whose father was the
      senior partner of an old and well-known firm of downtown merchants, was
      the leading questioner. She liked Mary and the latter liked her. Barbara
      was pretty and full of spirits and, although she was the only child, and a
      rather spoiled one, in a wealthy family, there was no snobbishness in her
      make-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;what you have been doing all the time.
      Where have you been keeping yourself? Don&rsquo;t you know ANYBODY?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I know a good many people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I mean. Don&rsquo;t you know any of the fellows at Harvard, or
      Tech, or Yale, or anywhere? I know dozens. And you must know some. You
      know Sam Keith; you said you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary admitted that she knew Sam slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he fun! Sam and I are great chums. Doesn&rsquo;t he dance divinely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never saw him dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve missed something. Do you know his friend, the one on the
      football team&mdash;Crawford Smith, his name is&mdash;do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve met him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You HAVE? Don&rsquo;t you think he is perfectly splendid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is. Haven&rsquo;t you read about him in the papers? He made that
      long run for a touchdown in the Yale game. Oh, you should have seen it! I
      couldn&rsquo;t speak for two days after that game. He was just as cool and calm.
      All the Yale men were trying to get him and he dodged&mdash;I never saw
      anyone so cool and who kept his head so well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought the papers spoke most of the way he kept his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you did read about it! Of course you did! I&rsquo;m just dying to know
      him. All the girls are crazy about him. Where did you meet him? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. On the occasion of her only meeting with Crawford Smith that
      young fellow had been anything but cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him in my uncle&rsquo;s store at South Harniss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was three
      years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t seen him since? He is a great friend of Sam&rsquo;s. And Sam&rsquo;s
      people have a summer home at the Cape. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll meet him there
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness! One would think you didn&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know that I do, particularly. Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you! Mary Lathrop, I do think you are the queerest girl. You
      don&rsquo;t talk like a girl at all. Sometimes I think you are as old as&mdash;as
      Prissy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prissy&rdquo; was the disrespectful nickname by which the young ladies
      referred, behind her back, to Miss Priscilla Cabot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;Not quite, I hope,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why I should
      be so very anxious to meet Crawford Smith. And I&rsquo;m sure he isn&rsquo;t anxious
      to meet me. If all the other girls are crazy about him, that ought to be
      enough, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This astonishing profession of indifference to the fascination of the
      football hero, indifference which Miss Barbara declared to be only
      make-believe, was made on a Saturday. The next day, as Mrs. Wyeth and Mary
      were on their way home from church, the former made an announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to have a guest, perhaps guests, at dinner this noon,&rdquo; she said.
      Sunday dinner at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s was served, according to New England custom,
      at one o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samuel, Mr. John Keith&rsquo;s son, is to dine with us,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Wyeth.
      &ldquo;He may bring a college friend with him. You have met Samuel, haven&rsquo;t you,
      Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary said that she had. She was a trifle embarrassed at the prospect of
      meeting Sam Keith in her new surroundings. At home, in South Harniss, they
      had met many times, but always at the store. He was pleasant and jolly and
      she liked him well enough, although she had refused his invitations to go
      on sailing parties and the like. She knew perfectly well that his mother
      and sister would not have approved of these invitations, for in the
      feminine Keith mind there was a great gulf fixed between the summer
      resident and the native. The latter was to be helped and improved but not
      encouraged socially beyond a certain point. Mary sought neither help nor
      improvement of that kind. Sam, it is true, had never condescended or
      patronized, but he had never called at her home nor had she been asked to
      visit his.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she was to meet him in a house where she was considered one of the
      family. His father had been influential in bringing her there. Did Sam
      know this and, if he did, what influence would the knowledge have upon his
      manner toward her? Would he be lofty and condescending or, on the other
      hand, would he pretend a familiar acquaintanceship which did not exist?
      Alone in her room she considered these questions and then put them from
      her mind. Whatever his manner might be, hers, she determined, should be
      what it had always been. And if any embarrassment was evident to others at
      this meeting it should not be on her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came downstairs, Mrs. Wyeth called to her to come into the
      parlor. As she entered the room two young men rose from the chairs beside
      the mahogany center table. One of these young men was Sam Keith; she had
      expected to see Sam, of course. But the other&mdash;the other was the very
      individual in whose daring deeds and glorified personality she had
      expressed a complete lack of interest only the day before, the young
      fellow whom she had last seen racing madly across the fields in the rear
      of Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s store with the larger portion of a sheet of
      sticky fly paper attached to his white flannels. Mr. Crawford Smith was
      taller and broader than on that memorable occasion but she recognized him
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that he did not recognize her. Mrs. Wyeth came to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you know Samuel, I think. You and he have met before.
      Samuel, will you introduce your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was staring at Mary with eyes which expressed a variety of emotions,
      intense surprise the most prominent. He was in a state which Barbara Howe
      would have described as &ldquo;fussed,&rdquo; one most unusual for him. He had known
      of Mary&rsquo;s presence in the house; after the affair was settled John Keith
      told his family what he had done, facing with serene philosophy his wife&rsquo;s
      displeasure and prophecies of certain regrets. Sam had vivid and pleasing
      recollections of the pretty country girl in the South Harniss store. He
      had not told his college friend that they were to meet her that day, one
      reason being that he was not certain they would meet, and the other a
      secret misgiving that it might be well to wait and inspect and listen
      before boasting of previous acquaintanceship. Sam&rsquo;s mother had lectured
      him on the subject before he left home. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too familiar, Sam,&rdquo; was
      her warning. &ldquo;You may be sorry if you do. The girl is well enough here in
      South Harniss, where she is accustomed to her surroundings, but in Boston
      she may be quite out of place and impossible. I have told your father so,
      but he won&rsquo;t listen, of course. Don&rsquo;t YOU be foolish, for my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here was no green country girl. The self-possessed young woman who
      stood before him looked no more out of place and impossible in Mrs.
      Wyeth&rsquo;s dignified and aristocratic parlor than she had in the store where
      he had last seen her. Her gown was simple and inexpensive but it was
      stylish and becoming. And her manner&mdash;well, her manner was distinctly
      more at ease than his at that moment. Mary had been but eight weeks among
      the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s young ladies, but she had used her eyes and her brain
      during that time; she was adaptable and had learned other things than
      those in the curriculum. Also, she was prepared for this meeting and had
      made up her mind to show no embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the usually blase Samuel was the embarrassed party. He looked and
      stammered. Mrs. Wyeth was surprised and shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samuel,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;what is the matter with you? Why don&rsquo;t you
      speak and not stand there staring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam, with an effort, recovered some of his self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I staring?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Cousin Emily. Er&mdash;How
      do you do, Miss Lathrop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Is your acquaintance as formal as that? I thought
      you knew each other. The boys and girls of this generation are beyond me.
      &lsquo;Miss Lathrop,&rsquo; indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Perhaps he didn&rsquo;t expect to see me here, Mrs. Wyeth,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;How do you do, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She and Sam shook hands. Mrs. Wyeth asked another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know Mary was with me, Samuel?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Cousin Emily, I knew. I knew she was here, of course. But&mdash;but
      I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;by George!&rdquo; with a sudden outburst of his real feelings, &ldquo;I
      hardly knew her, though. Really, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;Have I grown so much older in two months?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t changed that way. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; The young man,
      realizing that he was getting into deep water, seized an opportunity to
      scramble out. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Sorry, Crawford. Mary&mdash;Miss
      Lathrop, I want to present my friend, Crawford Smith. He&rsquo;s my roommate at
      college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary and Crawford shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met Mr. Smith, too, before,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentlemen, both of them, looked astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;Oh, I say! I didn&rsquo;t know that. When was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend, too, was plainly puzzled. &ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t believe I should have forgotten it. I don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember coming into my uncles&rsquo; store at South Harniss with
      Miss Keith, Sam&rsquo;s sister? You bought some&rdquo;&mdash;with a mischievous
      twinkle&mdash;&ldquo;some marshmallows, among other things. I sold them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Great Scott! Are you&mdash;why that girl&rsquo;s name was&mdash;what was
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the same as mine, Mary Augusta Lathrop. But in South Harniss they
      call me Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was it! And you are Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? Yes, of course you are! Well, I
      ought to be ashamed, I suppose, but I didn&rsquo;t recognize you. I AM ashamed.
      I was awfully obliged to you that day. You helped me out of a scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam, who had been listening with increasing curiosity, broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;When was this, Crawford? What
      scrape? You never told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t tell me that Miss Lathrop was here. You didn&rsquo;t say a word
      about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Didn&rsquo;t I? I must have forgotten to mention it. She&mdash;she IS here,
      you know.&rdquo; Mrs. Wyeth shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samuel, you&rsquo;re perfectly idiotic today,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Of course she is
      here; anyone with eyes can see she is. She is&mdash;ahem&mdash;visiting me
      and she is attending the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school. There! Now, Mr. Smith
      understands, I hope. And dinner is ready. Don&rsquo;t any of you say another
      word until we are at the table. My father used to say that lukewarm soup
      was the worst sort of cold reception and I agree with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During dinner Sam was tremendously curious to discover how and where his
      friend and Mary had met and what the scrape might be to which Crawford had
      referred. But his curiosity was unsatisfied. Mr. Smith refused to tell and
      Mary only smiled and shook her head when questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people furnished most of the conversation during the meal. The
      recent football season and its triumphant ending were discussed, of
      course, and the prospects of the hockey team came in for its share. Sam,
      it appeared, was out for a place on the hockey squad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see some of the games, Mary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get tickets for you
      and Cousin Emily. You&rsquo;re crazy about sports, aren&rsquo;t you, Cousin Emily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth regarded him through her eyeglasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;that that remark is intended as a joke. I saw
      one football game and the spectacle of those boys trampling each other to
      death before my eyes, and of you, Samuel Keith, hopping up and down
      shrieking, &lsquo;Tear &lsquo;em up&rsquo; and &lsquo;Smash &lsquo;em&rsquo; was the nearest approach to
      insanity I ever experienced. Since that time I have regarded Doctor Eliot
      as President Emeritus of an asylum and NOT a university.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam was hugely delighted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s football,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I will admit
      that no one but lunatics like Crawford here play football. Hockey, now, is
      different. I play hockey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford seemed surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he asked, with eager interest. &ldquo;No one has ever guessed it, not
      even the coach. You shouldn&rsquo;t keep it a secret from HIM, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease, having been invited out that day, was not present at dinner.
      After the coffee was served the irrepressible Sam proposed a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care to go, Cousin Emily,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sure Mary will. It
      is a fine afternoon and she needs the air. Crawford isn&rsquo;t much of a
      walker; he can stay and keep Cousin Emily company. We won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mary could decline this disinterested invitation Mrs. Wyeth saved
      her the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Samuel,&rdquo; she said, crisply. &ldquo;Your kindness is appreciated,
      particularly by Mr. Smith and myself. I can see that he is delighted with
      the idea. But Mary and I are going to the afternoon service at the
      Arlington Street church. So you will have to excuse us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This should have been a squelcher, but it was not. Sam announced that he
      and Crawford would go with them. &ldquo;We were thinking of going to church,
      weren&rsquo;t we, Crawford? It is just what I suggested, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth said &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; and that was all. She and Mary went to their
      rooms to get ready. Sam, surprised at the unexpected success of his sudden
      inspiration and immensely tickled, chuckled in triumph. But his joy was
      materially lessened when the quartette left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These sidewalks are too narrow for four,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Wyeth. &ldquo;Samuel,
      you may walk with me. Mary, you and Mr. Smith must keep close at our heels
      and walk fast. I never permit myself or my guests to be late at church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the walk Crawford asked a number of questions. How long had his
      companion been in the city? How long did she intend staying? Did she plan
      returning to the school for another year? Where would she spend the
      Christmas vacation? Mary said she was going home, to South Harniss, for
      the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bully old place, Cape Cod,&rdquo; declared Crawford. &ldquo;I never had a
      better time than I did on that visit at Sam&rsquo;s. Wish I were going there
      again some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head. &ldquo;Orders from home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Father insists
      on my coming home to him the moment the term closes. I made that visit to
      Sam&rsquo;s on my own responsibility and I got fits for doing it. Dad seems to
      have a prejudice against the East. He won&rsquo;t come here himself and he
      doesn&rsquo;t like to have me stay any longer than is absolutely necessary. When
      I wrote him I was at South Harniss he telegraphed me to come home in a
      hurry. He is Eastern born himself, lived somewhere this way when he was
      young, but he doesn&rsquo;t talk about it and has more prejudices against
      Eastern ways and Eastern people than if he&rsquo;d lived all his life in Carson
      City. Won&rsquo;t even come on to see me play football. I doubt if he comes to
      Commencement next spring; and I graduate, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder he permitted you to go to Harvard,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had to permit it. I&rsquo;ve always been for Harvard ever since I thought
      about college. Dad was all for a Western university, but I sat back in the
      stirrups and pulled for Harvard and finally he gave in. He generally gives
      in if I buck hard enough. He&rsquo;s a bully old Dad and we&rsquo;re great pals, more
      like brothers than father and son. The only point where we disagree is his
      confounded sectional prejudice. He thinks the sun not only sets in the
      West but rises there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl learned that he intended entering the Harvard Medical School in
      the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to fight for that, too,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted
      to be a doctor but Dad wouldn&rsquo;t give in for ever so long. He is interested
      in mining properties there at home and it was his idea that I should come
      in with him when I finished school. But I couldn&rsquo;t see it. I wanted to
      study medicine. Dad says there are almost as many starving doctors as
      there are down-at-the-heel lawyers; if I go in with him, he says, I shall
      have what is practically a sure thing and a soft snap for the rest of my
      days. That doesn&rsquo;t suit me. I want to work; I expect to. I want to paddle
      my own canoe. I may be the poorest M.D. that ever put up a sign, but I&rsquo;m
      going to put that sign up just the same. And if I starve I shan&rsquo;t ask him
      or anyone else to feed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed again as he said it, but there was a determined ring in his
      voice and a square set to his chin which Mary noticed and liked. He meant
      what he said, that was evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a doctor&rsquo;s profession is one of the noblest and finest in the
      world,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? Good for you! So do I. It doesn&rsquo;t bring in the dollars as fast as
      some others, but it does seem a man&rsquo;s job to me. The big specialists make
      a lot of money too, but that isn&rsquo;t exactly what I mean. Some of the best
      men I&rsquo;ve met were just country doctors, working night and day in all sorts
      of weather and getting paid or not, just as it happened. That old Doctor
      Harley down in your town is one of that kind, I think. I saw something of
      his work while I was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you had time for that, with all the
      picnics and sailing parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, though. I met him at Sam&rsquo;s. Mrs. Keith had a cold or a cough or
      something. He and I got to talking and he asked me to come and see him. I
      went, you bet! Went out with him on some of his drives while he made his
      calls, you know. He told me a lot of things. He&rsquo;s a brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he went on, after a moment, &ldquo;but I felt really at home down
      there in that little place. Seemed as if I had been there before and&mdash;and&mdash;by
      George, almost as if I belonged there. It was my first experience on and
      around salt water, but that seemed natural, too. And the people&mdash;I
      mean the people that belong there, not the summer crowd&mdash;I liked them
      immensely. Those two fine old cards that kept the store&mdash;Eh, I beg
      pardon; they are relatives of yours, aren&rsquo;t they? I forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are my uncles,&rdquo; said Mary, simply. &ldquo;I have lived with them almost
      all my life. They are the best men in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They seemed like it. I&rsquo;d like to know them better. Hello! here&rsquo;s that
      confounded church. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed this walk ever so much. Guess I&rsquo;ve done
      all the talking, though. Hope I haven&rsquo;t bored you to death gassing about
      my affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t. I enjoyed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really? Yes, I guess you did or you wouldn&rsquo;t say so. You don&rsquo;t
      act like a girl that pretends. By George! It&rsquo;s a relief to have someone to
      talk to, someone that understands and appreciates what a fellow is
      thinking about. Most girls want to talk football and dancing and all that.
      I like football immensely and dancing too, but there is something else in
      life. Even Sam&mdash;he&rsquo;s as good as they make but he doesn&rsquo;t care to
      listen to anything serious&mdash;that is, not long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary considered. &ldquo;I enjoyed listening,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I was glad to hear
      you liked South Harniss and my uncles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the way home, after the service, it was Sam Keith who escorted Mary,
      while Mrs. Wyeth walked with Mr. Smith. Sam&rsquo;s conversation was not
      burdened with seriousness. Hockey, dances, and good times were the
      subjects he dealt with. Was his companion fond of dancing? Would she
      accompany him to one of the club dances some time? They were great fun.
      Mrs. Wyeth could chaperon them, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary said she was afraid she would be too busy to accept. As a matter of
      fact, knowing what she did of his mother&rsquo;s feelings, she would have
      accepted no invitations from Sam Keith even if nothing else prevented her
      doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My studies take a good deal of my time,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over that,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I studied like blue
      blazes my freshman year, but after that&mdash;I should worry. Say, I&rsquo;m
      mighty glad I came over here today. I&rsquo;m coming again. I&rsquo;ll be a regular
      boarder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young men said good-by at the Wyeth door. Mrs. Wyeth did not ask them
      in, although the persistent Samuel threw out some pointed hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford Smith and Mary shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had an awfully good time,&rdquo; declared the former. Then, turning to
      Mrs. Wyeth, he asked: &ldquo;May I call occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s answer was, as usual, frank and unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall be very glad to see you&mdash;occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford turned to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary scarcely knew how to reply. There was no real reason why he should
      not call; she liked him so far. His frankness and earnestness of purpose
      appealed to her. And yet she was not at all sure that it was wise to
      continue the acquaintance. In her mind this coming to Boston to school was
      a very serious matter. Her uncles had sent her there to study; they needed
      her at home, but that need they had sacrificed in order that she might
      study and improve. Nothing else, friendships or good times or anything,
      must interfere with the purpose with which she had accepted the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; repeated Crawford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. I imagine I shall be very busy most of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. If you&rsquo;re busy you can send word for me to vamoose.
      That will be part of the bargain. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s first remark, after entering, was concerning Sam&rsquo;s friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather like that young person,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Samuel idolizes him, of
      course, but Samuel would worship a hyena if it played football. But this
      Smith boy&rdquo;&mdash;in Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s mind any male under thirty was a boy&mdash;&ldquo;seems
      to have some common sense and a mind of his own. I don&rsquo;t approve of his
      name nor the howling wilderness he comes from, but he can&rsquo;t help those
      drawbacks, I suppose. However, if he is to call here we must know
      something about him. I shall make inquiries.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The school term ended on a Saturday morning in mid-December. Mary&rsquo;s trunk
      was packed and ready, and she and it reached the South Station long before
      train time. She was going home, home for the holidays, and if she had been
      going on a trip around the world she could not have been more delighted at
      the prospect. And her delight and anticipations were shared in South
      Harniss. Her uncles&rsquo; letters for the past fortnight had contained little
      except joyful announcements of preparations for her coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are counting the minutes [wrote Zoeth]. The first thing Shadrach does
      every morning is to scratch another day off the calendar. I never saw him
      so worked up and excited and I calculate I ain&rsquo;t much different myself. I
      try not to set my heart on things of this world more than I ought to, but
      it does seem as if I couldn&rsquo;t think of much else but our girl&rsquo;s coming
      back to us. I am not going to worry the way Shadrach does about your
      getting here safe and sound. The Lord&rsquo;s been mighty good to us and I am
      sure He will fetch you to our door all right. I am contented to trust you
      in His hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S. One or both of us will meet you at the depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad&rsquo;s epistle was more worldly but not more coherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be sure and take the train that comes right on through [he wrote]. Don&rsquo;t
      take the one that goes to Woods Hole. Zoeth is so fidgety and nervous for
      fear you will make a mistake that he keeps me on pins and needles. Isaiah
      ain&rsquo;t much better. He swept out the setting-room twice last week and if he
      don&rsquo;t roast the cat instead of the chicken he is calculating to kill, it
      will be a mercy. I am the only one aboard the ship that keeps his head and
      I tell them not to worry. Be sure you take that through train. And look
      out for them electric cars, if you come to the depot in one. Better settle
      on the one you are going to take and then take the one ahead of it so as
      to be sure and not be late. Your train leaves the dock at quarter-past
      four. The Woods Hole one is two minutes earlier. Look out and not take
      that. Zoeth is afraid you will make a mistake, but I laugh at him. Don&rsquo;t
      take the wrong train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed when she read these letters, but there was a choke in the
      laugh. In spite of the perils of travel by the electrics and the New Haven
      railroad, she reached South Harniss safe, sound, and reasonably on time.
      The first person she saw on the platform of the station was Captain
      Shadrach. He had been pacing that platform for at least forty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spied her at the same time and came rushing to greet her, both hands
      outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here you be!&rdquo; he exclaimed with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Shad, here I am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you glad to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;JUMPIN&rsquo;!&rdquo; was the only answer he made, but it was fervent and sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode home together in the old buggy. As they reached the corner by
      the store Mary expected the vehicle to be brought to a halt at the curb,
      but it was not. The Captain chirruped to the horse and drove straight on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Uncle Shad!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Stop? What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to see Uncle Zoeth, of course. He&rsquo;s at the store, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s to home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was amazed and a trifle alarmed. One partner of Hamilton and Company
      was there in the buggy with her. By all the rules of precedent and South
      Harniss business the other should have been at the store. She knew that
      her uncles had employed no clerk or assistant since she left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but is Uncle Zoeth sick?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick? No, no, course he ain&rsquo;t sick. If he didn&rsquo;t have no better sense
      than to get sick the day you come home I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s
      I wouldn&rsquo;t drown him. HE ain&rsquo;t sick&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he added, as an
      afterthought, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got Saint Vitus dance from hoppin&rsquo; up and down to look
      out of the window, watchin&rsquo; for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he isn&rsquo;t sick, why isn&rsquo;t he at the store? Who is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a solitary soul,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That store&rsquo;s shut up tight and it&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to stay that way this whole blessed evenin&rsquo;. Zoeth and me we talked
      it over. I didn&rsquo;t know but we&rsquo;d better get Abel Snow&rsquo;s boy or that pesky
      Annabel or somebody to stay while we was havin&rsquo; supper. You see, we was
      both sot on eatin&rsquo; supper with you tonight, no matter store or not, and
      Isaiah, he was just as sot as we was. But all to once Zoeth had an idea.
      &lsquo;Shadrach,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in Scriptur&rsquo; times when people was real happy, same
      as we are now, they used to make a sacrifice to the Almighty to show how
      glad and grateful they was. Let&rsquo;s you and me make a sacrifice; let&rsquo;s
      sacrifice this evenin&rsquo;s trade&mdash;let&rsquo;s shut up the store on account of
      our girl&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; home.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good idea!&rsquo; says I, so we did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at him reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. It was dear and
      sweet of you to think of it, but you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it. It didn&rsquo;t
      need any sacrifice to prove that you were glad to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach winked over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that sacrifice worry you any,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The sacrifice is
      mainly in Zoeth&rsquo;s eye. Fur&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m concerned&mdash;well, Jabez Hedges told
      me yesterday that Rastus Young told him he cal&rsquo;lated he&rsquo;d have to be
      droppin&rsquo; in at the store some of these nights to buy some rubber boots and
      new ileskins. We sold him the ones he&rsquo;s got four years ago and he ain&rsquo;t
      paid for &lsquo;em yet. No, no, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, don&rsquo;t you worry about that
      sacrifice. I can sacrifice Rastus Young&rsquo;s trade eight days in the week and
      make money by it. Course I didn&rsquo;t tell Zoeth that; have to humor these
      pious folks much as we can, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled, but she shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your talking to me in
      that way, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know you too well. And right in the
      Christmas season, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth&rsquo;s welcome was as hearty, if not as exuberant, as Captain Shad&rsquo;s. He
      met her at the door and after the first hug and kiss held her off at arm&rsquo;s
      length and looked her over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! my! my!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And this is our little Mary-&rsquo;Gusta come back
      again! It don&rsquo;t seem as if it could be, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is, Uncle Zoeth,&rdquo; declared Mary, laughing. &ldquo;And ISN&rsquo;T it good to
      be here! Well, Isaiah,&rdquo; turning to Mr. Chase, who, aproned and
      shirtsleeved as usual, had been standing grinning in the background,
      &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you anything to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah had something to say and he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Feelin&rsquo; pretty smart? Got a new hat,
      ain&rsquo;t you? Supper&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the meal Mary was kept busy answering questions concerning school
      and her life at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s. In her letters she had endeavored to tell
      every possible item of news which might be interesting to her uncles, but
      now these items were one by one recalled, reviewed, and discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas kind of funny, that young Smith feller&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; up for dinner that
      time,&rdquo; observed Mr. Hamilton. &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late you was some surprised to see him,
      wan&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I think he was more surprised to
      see me, Uncle Zoeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad laughed heartily. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
      bring any fly paper along with him, did he? No? Well, that was an
      oversight. Maybe he thought fly time was past and gone. He seemed to be a
      real nice kind of young feller when he was down here that summer. He&rsquo;s
      older now; does he seem that way yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I think so. I only saw him for a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah seemed to think it time for him to put in a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good lookin&rsquo; as ever, I cal&rsquo;late, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was much amused. &ldquo;Why, I suppose he is,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But why in
      the world are you interested in his good looks, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase did his best to assume an expression of deep cunning. He winked
      at his employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t interested&mdash;not &lsquo;special,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t
      know but SOME folks might be. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He roared at his own pleasantry. Captain Shadrach, however, did not laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks?&rdquo; he repeated, tartly. &ldquo;What are you talkin&rsquo; about? What
      folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; what folks. I&rsquo;m just sayin&rsquo; SOME folks. Ho, ho! You
      know what I mean, don&rsquo;t you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mary could reply the Captain cut in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she don&rsquo;t know what you mean, neither,&rdquo; he declared, with emphasis.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of that now, Isaiah. Don&rsquo;t be any bigger fool than you can
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The self-satisfied grin faded from Isaiah&rsquo;s face and was succeeded by a
      look of surprised and righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re callin&rsquo; me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t callin&rsquo; you nothin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; you some free advice, that&rsquo;s all.
      Well, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I cal&rsquo;late, if you&rsquo;ve had supper enough, you and me and
      Zoeth will go into the settin&rsquo;-room, where we can all talk and I can
      smoke. I can always talk better under a full head of steam. Come on,
      Zoeth, Isaiah wants to be clearin&rsquo; the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Chase&rsquo;s thoughts were not concerned with table clearing just then.
      He stepped between Captain Shadrach and the door leading to the
      sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Shad Gould,&rdquo; he sputtered, &ldquo;you&mdash;you said somethin&rsquo; about a
      fool. Who&rsquo;s a fool? That&rsquo;s what I want to know&mdash;who&rsquo;s a fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I never was any hand at riddles. Come, come,
      Isaiah! Get out of the channel and let us through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold on, Cap&rsquo;n Shad! You answer me afore you leave this room. Who&rsquo;s a
      fool? I want to know who&rsquo;s a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go up to the post-office and ask some of the gang there,&rdquo; he
      suggested. &ldquo;Tell &lsquo;em you&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;em three guesses. There, there!&rdquo; he
      added, good-naturedly, pushing the irate Mr. Chase out of the &ldquo;channel.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t block the fairway any longer. It&rsquo;s all right, Isaiah. You and me
      have been shipmates too long to fight now. You riled me up a little,
      that&rsquo;s all. Come on, folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, after Mary had answered the last questions even Captain
      Shad could think of, had received answers to all her own, and had gone to
      her room for the night, Mr. Hamilton turned to his partner and observed
      mildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach, what made you so dreadful peppery to Isaiah this evenin&rsquo;? I
      declare, I thought you was goin&rsquo; to take his head off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grunted. &ldquo;I will take it off some time,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;if he
      don&rsquo;t keep the lower end of it shut when he&rsquo;d ought to. You heard what he
      said, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard. That about the Smith boy&rsquo;s good looks, you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. And about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s noticin&rsquo; how good-lookin&rsquo; he was.
      Rubbish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I know, but Isaiah was only jokin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jokin&rsquo;! Well, he may LOOK like a comic almanac, but he needn&rsquo;t try to
      joke like one while that girl of ours is around. Puttin&rsquo; notions about
      fellers and good looks and keepin&rsquo; company into her head! You might expect
      such stuff from them fool drummers that come to the store, but an old
      leather-skinned image like Isaiah Chase ought to have more sense. We don&rsquo;t
      want such notions put in her head, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth rubbed his chin. He did not speak and his silence seemed to irritate
      his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do we?&rdquo; repeated the latter, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth sighed. &ldquo;No, Shadrach,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I guess likely we don&rsquo;t, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to realize that those kind of notions come&mdash;come
      sort of natural to young folks Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! I don&rsquo;t believe that girl&rsquo;s got a single one of &lsquo;em in her
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not, but they&rsquo;ll be there some day. Ah, well,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we
      mustn&rsquo;t be selfish, you and me, Shadrach. It&rsquo;ll be dreadful hard to give
      her up to somebody else, but if that somebody is a good man, kind and
      straight and honest, why, I for one will try not to complain. But, Oh,
      Shadrach! Suppose he should turn out to be the other thing. Suppose SHE
      makes the mistake that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His friend interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shh! shh!&rdquo; he broke in, quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so, Zoeth. Come on to bed,&rdquo;
       he added, rising from his chair. &ldquo;This very evenin&rsquo; I was callin&rsquo; Isaiah
      names for talkin&rsquo; about &lsquo;fellers&rsquo; and such, and here you and I have been
      sittin&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else. If you hear me say &lsquo;fool&rsquo; in my sleep
      tonight just understand I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to myself, that&rsquo;s all. Come on aloft,
      Zoeth, and turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following morning Mary astonished her uncles by announcing that as
      soon as she had helped Isaiah with the breakfast dishes and the bed making
      she was going up to the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Captain Shad. &ldquo;Course we&rsquo;ll be mighty glad to have
      your company, but Zoeth and me presumed likely you&rsquo;d be for goin&rsquo; round
      callin&rsquo; on some of the other girls today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not. If they want to see me they can call on me here. I&rsquo;m going
      up to the store with you and Uncle Zoeth. I want to help sell those
      Christmas goods of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners looked at each other. Even Zoeth was moved to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t likely that your Uncle Shadrach and
      I are goin&rsquo; to let you sell goods in that store. We won&rsquo;t hear of it, will
      we, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a thunderin&rsquo; sight!&rdquo; declared Shadrach, vehemently. &ldquo;The idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I&rsquo;ve sold a good many there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you have. You shan&rsquo;t sell any more. &lsquo;Twas all right when
      you was just a&mdash;a girl, a South Harnisser like the rest of us, but
      now that you&rsquo;re a Boston young lady, up to a fin&mdash;er&mdash;what-d&rsquo;ye-call-it
      &mdash;er&mdash;endin&rsquo; school&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finishin&rsquo; school, Shadrach,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever &lsquo;tis; I know &lsquo;twould be the end of ME if I had to live up
      to the style of it. &lsquo;Anyhow, now that you&rsquo;re there, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, a young
      lady, same as I said, we ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary interrupted. &ldquo;Hush, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Hush, this
      minute! You&rsquo;re talking nonsense, I AM a South Harniss girl and I&rsquo;m NOT a
      Boston young lady. My chief reasons for being so very happy at the thought
      of coming home here for my Christmas vacation were, first, that I should
      see you and Uncle Zoeth and Isaiah and the house and the horse and the cat
      and the hens, and, next, that I could help you with the Christmas trade at
      the store. I know perfectly well you need me. I&rsquo;m certain you have been
      absolutely lost without me. Now, really and truly, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mite,&rdquo; declared the Captain, stoutly, spoiling the effect of the
      denial, however, by adding, although his partner had not spoken: &ldquo;Shut up,
      Zoeth! We ain&rsquo;t, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you. At any rate,
      I&rsquo;m going up there this minute to see for myself. Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no comment on what she saw at the store, but for the remainder of
      the forenoon she was very busy. In spite of the partners&rsquo; protests, in
      fact paying no more attention to those perturbed men of business than if
      they were flies to be brushed aside when bothersome, she went ahead,
      arranging, rearranging, dusting, writing price tickets, lettering
      placards, doing all sorts of things, and waiting on customers in the
      intervals. At noon, when she and her Uncle Zoeth left for home and dinner,
      she announced herself in a measure satisfied. &ldquo;Of course there is a great
      deal to do yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but the stock looks a little more as if it
      were meant to sell and less as if it were heaped up ready to be carted off
      and buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the store of Hamilton and Company was visited by a goodly
      number of South Harniss residents. That evening there were more. The news
      that Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop was at home and was &ldquo;tendin&rsquo; store&rdquo; for her
      uncles spread and was much discussed. The majority of those who came did
      so not because they contemplated purchasing extensively, but because they
      wished to see what effect the fashionable finishing school had had upon
      the girl. The general opinion seemed to be that it &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t changed her a
      mite.&rdquo; This result, however, was considered a desirable one by the
      majority, but was by some criticized. Among the critics was Mrs. Rebecca
      Mullet, whose daughter Irene also was away at school undergoing the
      finishing process.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Mullet, with decision, as she and her husband
      emerged from the store together. &ldquo;Well! If THAT&rsquo;S a sample of what the
      school she goes to does for them that spend their money on it, I&rsquo;m mighty
      glad we didn&rsquo;t send our Rena there, ain&rsquo;t you, Christopher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chris Mullet, who had received that very week a bill for his
      daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; uttered a fervent assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It costs enough where Rena is, without sendin&rsquo; 
      her to no more expensive place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not exactly the reply his wife had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; she grunted, impatiently. &ldquo;I do wish you could get along for two
      minutes without puttin&rsquo; on poor mouth. I suppose likely you tell everybody
      that you can&rsquo;t afford a new overcoat account of Rena&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away to
      school. You&rsquo;d ought to be prouder of your daughter than you are of an
      overcoat, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mullet muttered something to the effect that he was dum sure he was
      not proud of his present overcoat. His wife ignored the complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be proud of Irene when she comes home,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;She
      won&rsquo;t be like that Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, standin&rsquo; up behind the counter and sellin&rsquo; 
      goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, now, Becky, what&rsquo;s the matter with her doin&rsquo; that? She always used
      to sell goods, and behind that very counter, too. And she certainly can
      SELL &lsquo;em!&rdquo; with a reminiscent chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mullet glared at him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she drawled, with sarcasm, &ldquo;so she can&mdash;to
      some folks. Look at you, with all that Christmas junk under your arm! You
      didn&rsquo;t need to buy that stuff any more&rsquo;n you needed to fly. What did you
      buy it for? Tell me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chris shook his head. &ldquo;Blessed if I know,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any idea
      of buyin&rsquo; it, but she and me got to talkin&rsquo;, and she kept showin&rsquo; the
      things to me, and I kept lookin&rsquo; at &lsquo;em and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and kept lookin&rsquo; at her, too! Don&rsquo;t talk to ME! There&rsquo;s no fool like
      an old fool&mdash;and an old man fool is the worst of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, usually meek and long-suffering under wifely discipline,
      evinced unwonted spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I tell you this, Becky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fur&rsquo;s I can see, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s
      all right. She&rsquo;s as pretty as a picture, to begin with; she&rsquo;s got money of
      her own to spend; and she&rsquo;s been away among folks that have got a lot
      more. All them things together are enough to spoil &lsquo;most any girl, but
      they haven&rsquo;t spoiled her. She&rsquo;s come home here not a mite stuck-up, not
      flirty nor silly nor top-lofty, but just as sensible and capable and
      common-folksy as ever she was, and that&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;. If our Rena
      turns out to be the girl Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop is I WILL be proud of her,
      and don&rsquo;t you forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Which terminated conversation in the Mullet family for that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the few, like Mrs. Mullet, were inclined to criticize, the many,
      like her husband, united in declaring Mary to be &ldquo;all right.&rdquo; And her
      rearranging and displaying of the Christmas goods helped her and her
      uncles to dispose of them. In fact, for the three days before Christmas it
      became necessary to call in the services of Annabel as assistant
      saleslady. The store was crowded, particularly in the evenings, and Zoeth
      and Captain Shad experienced for the first time in months the sensation of
      being the heads of a prosperous business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks good to see so many young folks in here, don&rsquo;t it, Zoeth?&rdquo; observed
      the Captain. &ldquo;And not only girls, but fellers, too. Don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve
      seen so many young fellers in here. Who&rsquo;s that young squirt Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s
      waitin&rsquo; on now? The one with the whittled-in back to his overcoat. Say,
      Solomon in all his glory wasn&rsquo;t arrayed like one of him! Must be some city
      feller, eh? Nobody I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth looked at his niece and her customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess you ain&rsquo;t rubbed your glasses lately, Shadrach.
      That&rsquo;s Dan Higgins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higgins it was, home for a few days&rsquo; relaxation from the fatigues of
      coffin selling, and garbed as usual in city clothes the splendor of which,
      as Captain Shad said afterwards, &ldquo;would have given a blind man eyestrain.&rdquo;
       Daniel&rsquo;s arms were filled with purchases and he and Mary were standing
      beside the table where the toys and games were displayed. Mary was gazing
      at the toys; Mr. Higgins was&mdash;not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partners regarded the pair for a moment. Shadrach frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to find somethin&rsquo; his little brother&rsquo;ll like,&rdquo; explained
      Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; observed the Captain, dryly. &ldquo;Well, he looks as if he&rsquo;d found
      somethin&rsquo; HE liked pretty well. Here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I&rsquo;ll finish waitin&rsquo; on
      Dan. You just see what Mrs. Nickerson wants, will you, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Eve ended the rush of business for Hamilton and Company. The
      following week, the last of Mary&rsquo;s vacation, was certain to be dull
      enough. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; to do but change presents for folks,&rdquo; prophesied Captain
      Shad. &ldquo;Give them somethin&rsquo; they want and take back somethin&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t
      want. That kind of trade is like shovelin&rsquo; fog up hill, more exercise than
      profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Christmas was a happy day at the white house by the shore, a day of
      surprises. To begin with, there were the presents which were beside the
      plates at breakfast. Mary had brought gifts for all, Captain Shadrach,
      Zoeth, and Isaiah. There was nothing expensive, of course, but each had
      been chosen to fit the taste and liking of the recipient and there was no
      doubt that each choice was a success. Isaiah proudly displayed a jacknife
      which was a small toolchest, having four blades, a corkscrew, a
      screwdriver, a chisel, a button-hook and goodness knows what else besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; crowed Isaiah, exhibiting the knife, bristling like a
      porcupine, on his open palm. &ldquo;Look at it! By time, there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; I
      can&rsquo;t do with that knife! Every time I look at it I find somethin&rsquo; new.
      Now, I wonder what that is,&rdquo; pointing to a particularly large and
      ferocious-looking implement which projected from the steel tangle. &ldquo;I
      cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ve sized up about everything else, but I can&rsquo;t seem to make out
      what that&rsquo;s for. What do you cal&rsquo;late &lsquo;tis, Cap&rsquo;n Shad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s simple,&rdquo; he said, gravely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a crust crowbar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crust crowbar. For openin&rsquo; one of them cast-iron pies same as you made
      for us last week. You drill a hole in the crust nigh the edge of the plate
      and then put that thing in and pry the upper deck loose. Good idea,
      Isaiah! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, go to grass!&rdquo; interrupted the indignant Mr. Chase. &ldquo;I notice you
      always eat enough of my pies, decks&mdash;yes, and hull and riggin&rsquo;, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was THE great surprise, that which the partners had prepared
      for their idolized niece. Mary found beside her plate a small, oblong
      package, wrapped in tissue paper and labeled, &ldquo;To Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, from Uncle
      Shadrach and Uncle Zoeth, with a Merry Christmas.&rdquo; Inside the paper was a
      pasteboard box, inside that a leather case, and inside THAT a handsome
      gold watch and chain. Then there was much excited exclaiming and delighted
      thanks on Mary&rsquo;s part, and explanations and broad grins on that of the
      givers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shouldn&rsquo;t have done it! Of course you shouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; protested Mary.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly lovely and I wanted a watch more than anything; but I KNOW
      this must have cost a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, neither,&rdquo; protested the Captain. &ldquo;We got it wholesale. Edgar
      Emery&rsquo;s nephew is in the business up to Providence and he picked it out
      for us. Didn&rsquo;t begin to cost what we cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twould, did it, Zoeth?
      When you buy things wholesale that way you can &lsquo;most always cal&rsquo;late to
      get &lsquo;em lower than you cal&rsquo;late to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled at this somewhat involved statement, but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it cost a great deal more than you should have spent,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you like it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; queried Zoeth, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it! Oh, Uncle Zoeth, don&rsquo;t you KNOW I like it! Who could help liking
      such a beautiful thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s it show up alongside the watches the other girls have up to that
      Boston school?&rdquo; asked Shadrach, with ill-concealed anxiety. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t
      want our girl&rsquo;s watch to be any cheaper&rsquo;n theirs, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was enthusiastic enough to satisfy even the Captain and Mr.
      Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there isn&rsquo;t another girl in the school whose watch means to her
      what this will mean to me,&rdquo; declared Mary. &ldquo;I shall keep it and love it
      all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners heaved a sigh of relief. Whether or not the watch was fine
      enough for their Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had been a source of worriment and much
      discussion. And then Isaiah, with his customary knack of saying the wrong
      thing, tossed a brickbat into the puddle of general satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. You can keep it all your
      life, and when you get to be an old woman and married and have
      grandchildren then you can give it to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach, who had taken up his napkin preparatory to tucking it
      under his chin, turned in his chair and glared at the unconscious steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by the jumpin&rsquo; fire!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with conviction. &ldquo;The feller is
      sartinly possessed. He&rsquo;s lovesick, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with him. All
      he can talk about is somebody&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; married. Are YOU cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to get
      married, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? What kind of fool talk is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the lucky woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no lucky woman. Don&rsquo;t talk so ridic&rsquo;lous! All I said was that
      when Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was old and married and had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go again! Married and children! Say, did it ever run acrost
      your mind that you was a little mite previous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said children. What I said was when she was old and had
      grandchildren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandchildren! Well, that&rsquo;s a dum sight MORE previous. Let&rsquo;s have
      breakfast, all hands, for the land sakes! Isaiah&rsquo;ll have us cruisin&rsquo; along
      with the third and fourth generation in a few minutes. I&rsquo;M satisfied with
      this one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at bedtime, as the partners separated in the upper hall to
      go to their respective rooms, Zoeth said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach, this has been a mighty nice Christmas for us all, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad nodded emphatically. &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to
      me I ever remember a nicer one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, neither. I&mdash;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, heave ahead. What are you waitin&rsquo; for? What do you wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just wonderin&rsquo; if &lsquo;twas right for us to be so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have we been&mdash;well, good enough this past year to deserve
      happiness like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t puttin&rsquo; in any testimony on my own hook,&rdquo; he said, dryly, &ldquo;but I
      don&rsquo;t seem to remember your bein&rsquo; desperately wicked, Zoeth. Course you
      MAY have got drunk and disorderly that time when Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and I left
      you and went to Boston, but I kind of doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Shadrach! Don&rsquo;t joke about serious things. What I mean is
      have you and I walked the Lord&rsquo;s way as straight as we&rsquo;d ought to? We&rsquo;ve
      tried&mdash;that is, seems &lsquo;s if we had&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know. Anyhow,
      all this afternoon I&rsquo;ve had a funny feelin&rsquo; that you and me and
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was&mdash;well was as if the tide had been comin&rsquo; in for us
      all these years since she&rsquo;s been livin&rsquo; with us, and as if now &lsquo;twould
      begin to go out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what you call a FUNNY feelin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Zoeth, I&rsquo;ve got a funny feelin&rsquo;, too, but I know what&rsquo;s the
      reason for it&mdash;the reason is turkey and plum puddin&rsquo; and mince pie
      and the land knows what. When a couple of old hulks like you and me h&rsquo;ist
      in a cargo of that kind it&rsquo;s no wonder we have feelin&rsquo;s. Good night,
      shipmate.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after New Year&rsquo;s Mary went back to Boston and to school. The long
      winter term&mdash;the term which Madeline Talbott, whose father was a
      judge, called &ldquo;the extreme penalty&rdquo;&mdash;began. Boston&rsquo;s famous east
      winds, so welcome in summer and so raw and penetrating in winter, brought
      their usual allowance of snow and sleet, and the walks from Pinckney
      Street to the school and back were not always pleasant. Mrs. Wyeth had a
      slight attack of tonsillitis and Miss Pease a bronchial cold, but they
      united in declaring these afflictions due entirely to their own imprudence
      and not in the least to the climate, which, being like themselves,
      thoroughly Bostonian, was expected to maintain a proper degree of chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, fortunately, escaped colds and illness. The walks in all sorts of
      weather did her good and her rosy cheeks and clear eyes were competent
      witnesses to her state of health. She was getting on well with her
      studies, and the Misses Cabot, not too easy to please, were apparently
      pleased with her. At home&mdash;for she had come to consider Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s
      comfortable house a home, although not of course to be compared with the
      real home at South Harniss&mdash;at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s she was more of a
      favorite than ever, not only with the mistress of the house, but with Miss
      Pease, who was considered eccentric and whose liking was reported hard to
      win. The two ladies had many talks concerning the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is remarkable,&rdquo; declared Miss Pease on one occasion. &ldquo;Considering her
      lack of early advantages, I consider her ease of manner and
      self-possession remarkable. She is a prodigy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth sniffed. She enjoyed hearing Mary praised, but she objected to
      her friend&rsquo;s choice of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For mercy sake, Letitia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call her that. The word
      &lsquo;prodigy&rsquo; always reminds me of the Crummles infant, the one with the green
      parasol and the white&mdash;er&mdash;lingerie, in &lsquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease smiled with the superiority of the corrected who is about to
      correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why that should bring the individual you mention to mind,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;If I remember correctly&mdash;and I was brought up on Dickens&mdash;she
      was a &lsquo;phenomenon,&rsquo; not a prodigy. However, it makes no material
      difference what you and I call Mary Lathrop, the fact remains that she is
      an exceptionally well-behaved, good-mannered, polite&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweet, healthy girl,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Wyeth, finishing the sentence. &ldquo;I
      know that as well as you do, Letitia Pease. And you know I know it. Now,
      what have you in your mind concerning Mary? I know there is something,
      because you have been hinting at it for more than a week. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease looked wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have a plan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell even you, Emily, just what it
      is as yet. You see, it isn&rsquo;t really a plan, but only an idea so far. She
      doesn&rsquo;t know it herself, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Is it a pleasant plan&mdash;or idea, whichever you call it? That is,
      will she think it pleasant when she learns what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Letitia,&rdquo; with sudden suspicion, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t planning some
      ridiculous sentimental nonsense for that child, are you? You&rsquo;re not trying
      to make a match for her, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Match? What are you talking about? If you mean am I trying to get her
      married to some MAN,&rdquo; with a scornful emphasis on the word, &ldquo;I most
      certainly am not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, if she ever is married, I presume it will be to a man, or an
      imitation of one. All right, Letitia. I am glad your great idea isn&rsquo;t
      that, whatever it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not. You know my opinion of marriage, Emily Wyeth. And, so far as
      matchmaking is concerned, I should say you were a more likely subject for
      suspicion. That young relative of yours, Sam Keith, appears to be coming
      here a great deal of late. He MAY come solely to see you, but I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Samuel has been rather prevalent recently,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t let
      that trouble you, Letitia. I have had my eye on the young man. Samuel is
      as susceptible to pretty girls as children are to the measles. And his
      attacks remind me of the measles as much as anything, sudden outbreak,
      high fever and delirium, then a general cooling off and a rapid recovery.
      This seizure isn&rsquo;t alarming and there is absolutely no danger of
      contagion. Mary doesn&rsquo;t take him seriously at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about that other young man?&mdash;Smith, I think his name is. He
      has called here twice since Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth seemed to be losing patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothing that I know of, except, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no perhaps at all. The Smith boy appears to be a very nice young
      fellow, and remarkably sensible for a young person in this hoity-toity
      age. From what I can learn, his people, although they do live out West&mdash;down
      in a mine or up on a branch or a ranch or something&mdash;are respectable.
      Why shouldn&rsquo;t he call to see Mary occasionally, and why shouldn&rsquo;t she see
      him? Goodness gracious! What sort of a world would this be if young people
      didn&rsquo;t see each other? Don&rsquo;t tell me that you never had any young male
      acquaintances when you were a girl, Letitia, because I shan&rsquo;t believe
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease straightened in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not likely that I shall make any such preposterous statement,&rdquo; she
      snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the &ldquo;young male acquaintance&rdquo; called occasionally&mdash;not too often&mdash;Mrs.
      Wyeth saw to that; probably not so often as he would have liked; but he
      did call and the acquaintanceship developed into friendship. That it might
      develop into something more than friendship no one, except possibly the
      sentimental Miss Pease, seemed to suspect. Certainly Mary did not, and at
      this time it is doubtful if Crawford did, either. He liked Mary Lathrop.
      She was a remarkably pretty girl but, unlike other pretty girls he had
      known&mdash;and as good-looking college football stars are privileged
      beyond the common herd, he had known at least several&mdash;she did not
      flirt with him, nor look admiringly up into his eyes, nor pronounce his
      jokes &ldquo;killingly funny,&rdquo; nor flatter him in any way. If the jokes WERE
      funny she laughed a healthy, genuine laugh, but if, as sometimes happened,
      they were rather feeble, she was quite likely to tell him so. She did not
      always agree with his views, having views of her own on most subjects, and
      if he asked her opinion the answer he received was always honest, if not
      precisely what he expected or hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! You&rsquo;re frank, at any rate,&rdquo; he observed, rather ruefully,
      after asking her opinion as to a point of conduct and receiving it
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you want me to be?&rdquo; asked Mary. &ldquo;You asked me what I thought you
      should have done and I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you did. You certainly told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you want me to tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I wanted you to tell me just that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you asked me what I thought, and that is exactly what I think. Don&rsquo;t
      YOU think it is what you should have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford hesitated; then he laughed. &ldquo;Why yes, confound it, I do,&rdquo; he
      admitted. &ldquo;But I hoped you would tell me that what I did do was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I thought so or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;yes. Honestly now, didn&rsquo;t you know I wanted
      you to say the other thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Mary&rsquo;s turn to hesitate; then she, too, laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo; she began; and finished with, &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you say it? Most girls would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is why. I judge that most girls of your acquaintance say
      just about what you want them to. Don&rsquo;t you think it is good for you to be
      told the truth occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was good for him, of course, and, incidentally, it had the fascination
      of novelty. Here was a girl full of fun, ready to take a joke as well as
      give one, neither flattering nor expecting flattery, a country girl who
      had kept store, yet speaking of that phase of her life quite as freely as
      she did of the fashionable Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school, not at all ashamed to
      say she could not afford this or that, simple and unaffected but
      self-respecting and proud; a girl who was at all times herself and
      retained her poise and common sense even in the presence of handsome young
      demigod who had made two touchdowns against Yale.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was extremely good for Crawford Smith to know such a girl. She helped
      him to keep his feet on the ground and his head from swelling. Not that
      there was much danger of the latter happening, for the head was a pretty
      good one, but Mary Lathrop&rsquo;s common sense was a stimulating&mdash;and
      fascinating&mdash;reenforcement to his own. As he had said on the Sunday
      afternoon of their first meeting in Boston, it was a relief to have
      someone to talk to who understood and appreciated a fellow&rsquo;s serious
      thoughts as well as the frivolous ones. His approaching graduation from
      Harvard and the work which he would begin at the Medical School in the
      fall were very much in his mind just now. He told Mary his plans and she
      and he discussed them. She had plans of her own, principally concerning
      what she meant to do to make life easier for her uncles when her school
      days were over, and these also were discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s really nonsense, after all, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the idea of your keeping store again. You&rsquo;ll never do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I shall! Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well, because I don&rsquo;t think you will, that&rsquo;s all. Girls
      like you don&rsquo;t have to keep a country store, you know&mdash;at least, not
      for long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remark was intended to please; it might have pleased some girls, but
      it did not please this one. Mary&rsquo;s dignity was offended. Anything
      approaching a slur upon her beloved uncles, or their place of business, or
      South Harniss, or the Cape Cod people, she resented with all her might.
      Her eyes snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not HAVE to keep store at any time,&rdquo; she said crisply, &ldquo;in the
      country or elsewhere. I do it because I wish to and I shall continue to do
      it as long as I choose. If my friends do not understand that fact and
      appreciate my reasons, they are not my friends, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford threw up both hands. &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot; I&rsquo;ll
      come down! Great Scott! If you take a fellow&rsquo;s head off like that when he
      pays you a compliment what would you do if he dared to criticize?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that remark of yours intended as a compliment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly; more as a statement of fact. I meant&mdash;I meant&mdash;Oh,
      come now, Mary! You know perfectly well what I meant. Own up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary tried hard to be solemn and severe, but the twinkle in his eye was
      infectious and in spite of her effort her lips twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Own up, now,&rdquo; persisted Crawford. &ldquo;You know what I meant. Now, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, I suppose I do. But I think the remark was a very silly
      one. That is the way Sam Keith talks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, does he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Or he would if I would let him. And he does it much better than you
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. That is why I don&rsquo;t want you to do it. I expect you to be more
      sensible. And, besides, I won&rsquo;t have you or anyone making fun of my
      uncles&rsquo; store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Making fun of it! I should say not! I have a vivid and most respectful
      memory of it, as you ought to know. By the way, you told me your uncles
      had sent you their photographs. May I see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary brought the photographs from her room. They had been taken by the
      photographer at Ostable in compliance with what amounted to an order on
      her part, and the results showed two elderly martyrs dressed in
      respectable but uncomfortable Sunday clothes and apparently awaiting
      execution. On the back of one mournful exhibit was written, &ldquo;Mary Augusta
      from Uncle Shadrach,&rdquo; and on the other, &ldquo;Uncle Zoeth to Mary Augusta, with
      much love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; commanded Mary, as she handed the photographs to
      Crawford. &ldquo;I know they are funny, but if you laugh I&rsquo;ll never forgive you.
      The poor dears had them taken expressly to please me, and I am perfectly
      sure either would have preferred having a tooth out. They ARE the best men
      in the world and I am more certain of it every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford did not laugh at the photographs. He was a young gentleman of
      considerable discretion and he did not smile, not even at Captain Shad&rsquo;s
      hands, the left with fingers separated and clutching a knee as if to keep
      it from shaking, the right laid woodenly upon a gorgeously bound
      parlor-table copy of &ldquo;Lucille.&rdquo; Instead of laughing he praised the
      originals of the pictures, talked reminiscently of his own visit in South
      Harniss, and finally produced from his pocketbook a small photographic
      print, which he laid upon the table beside the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought that to show you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were asking about my father,
      you know, and I told you I hadn&rsquo;t a respectable photograph of him. That
      was true; I haven&rsquo;t. Dad has another eccentricity besides his dislike of
      the East and Eastern ways of living; he has a perfect horror of having his
      photograph taken. Don&rsquo;t ask me why, because I can&rsquo;t tell you. It isn&rsquo;t
      because he is ugly; he&rsquo;s a mighty good-looking man for his age, if I do
      say it. But he has a prejudice against photographs of himself and won&rsquo;t
      even permit me to take a snapshot if he can prevent it. Says people who
      are always having their pictures taken are vain, conceited idiots, and so
      on. However, I catch him unawares occasionally, and this is a snap I took
      last summer. He and I were on a fishing trip up in the mountains. We&rsquo;re
      great pals, Dad and I&mdash;more than most fathers and sons, I imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary took the photograph and studied it with interest. Mr. Smith, senior,
      was a big man, broad-shouldered and heavy, with a full gray beard and
      mustache. He wore a broad-brimmed hat, which shaded his forehead somewhat,
      but his eyes and the shape of his nose were like his son&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at the photograph and Crawford looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of him?&rdquo; asked the young man after an interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think?&rdquo; repeated Mary absently, still staring at the photograph. &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what is your opinion of my respected dad? You must have one by
      this time. You generally have one on most subjects and you&rsquo;ve been looking
      at that picture for at least five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? I beg your pardon; I didn&rsquo;t realize. The picture interested me. I
      have never seen your father, have I? No, of course I haven&rsquo;t. But it
      almost seems as if I had. Perhaps I have seen someone who looks like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Myself, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That was stupid of me, wasn&rsquo;t it? He looks like an interesting
      man, one who has had experiences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has. Dad doesn&rsquo;t talk about himself much, even to me, but he had some
      hard rubs before he reached the smooth places. Had to fight his way, I
      guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as if he had. But he got his way in the end, I should imagine.
      He doesn&rsquo;t look like one who gives up easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t. Pretty stubborn sometimes, Dad is, but a brick to me, just the
      same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your mother an Eastern woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She was a Westerner, from California. Dad was married twice. His
      first wife came from New England somewhere, I believe. I didn&rsquo;t know there
      had been another wife until I was nearly fifteen years old, and then I
      found it out entirely by accident. She was buried in another town, you
      see. I saw her name first on the gravestone and it made an impression on
      me because it was so odd and old-fashioned&mdash;&lsquo;Patience, wife of Edwin
      Smith.&rsquo; I only mention this to show you how little Dad talks about
      himself, but it was odd I should find it out that way, wasn&rsquo;t it? But
      there! I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re interested in the Smith genealogy. I
      apologize. I never think of discussing my family affairs with anyone but
      you, not even Sam. But you&mdash;well, somehow I seem to tell you
      everything. I wonder why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps because I ask too many questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that. It is because you act as if you really cared to have
      me talk about my own affairs. I never met a girl before that did. Now, I
      want to ask you about that club business. There&rsquo;s going to be the deuce
      and all to pay in that if I&rsquo;m not careful. Have you thought it over? What
      would you do if you were I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter in question was a somewhat delicate and complicated one,
      dealing with the admission or rejection of a certain fellow to one of the
      Harvard societies. There was a strong influence working to get him in and,
      on the other hand, there were some very good objections to his admission.
      Crawford, president of the club and one of its most influential members,
      was undecided what to do. He had explained the case to Mary upon the
      occasion of his most recent visit to the Pinckney Street house, and had
      asked her advice. She had taken time for consideration, of course&mdash;she
      was the old Mary-&rsquo;Gusta still in that&mdash;and now the advice was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I should try to settle it like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She explained her plan. Crawford listened, at first dubiously and then
      with steadily growing enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when she had finished. &ldquo;That would do it, I
      honestly believe. How in the world did you ever think of that scheme? Say,
      you really are a wonder at managing. You could manage a big business and
      make it go, I&rsquo;m sure. How do you do it? Where do you get your ideas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. His praise pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I just think them out, I guess. I do like
      to manage things for people. Sometimes I do it more than I should,
      perhaps. Poor Isaiah Chase, at home in South Harniss, says I boss him to
      death. And my uncles say I manage them, too&mdash;but they seem to like
      it,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder they do. I like it, myself. Will you help manage my
      affairs between now and Commencement? There&rsquo;ll be a whole lot to manage,
      between the club and the dance and all the rest of it. And then when you
      go to Commencement you can see for yourself how they work out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Commencement? Am I going to Commencement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are! You&rsquo;re going with me, I hope. I thought that was
      understood. It&rsquo;s a long way off yet, but for goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t say you
      won&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve been counting on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s pleasure showed in her face. All she said, however, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much. I shall be very glad to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Commencement was, as Crawford said, still a good way off and in the
      meantime there were weeks of study. The weeks passed, some of them, and
      then came the Easter vacation. Mary spent the vacation in South Harniss,
      of course, and as there was no Christmas rush to make her feel that she
      was needed at the store, she rested and drove and visited and had a
      thoroughly happy and profitable holiday. The happiness and profit were
      shared by her uncles, it is unnecessary to state. When she questioned them
      concerning business and the outlook for the coming summer, they seemed
      optimistic and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Isaiah says there are two new stores to be opened in the village this
      spring,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think they may hurt your trade a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach dismissed the idea and his prospective competitors with a
      condescending wave of the hand. &ldquo;Not a mite,&rdquo; he declared scornfully. &ldquo;Not
      a mite, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s a pretty able old craft. She
      may not show so much gilt paint and brass work as some of the new ones
      just off the ways, but her passengers know she&rsquo;s staunch and they&rsquo;ll stick
      by her. Why, Isaiah was sayin&rsquo; that a feller was tellin&rsquo; him only
      yesterday that it didn&rsquo;t make any difference how many new stores was
      started in this town, he&rsquo;d never trade anywheres but with Hamilton and
      Company. That shows you, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it said that, Uncle Shad?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Why, I don&rsquo;t know. Isaiah was tellin&rsquo; me about it and we was
      interrupted. Who was it, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas Rastus Young,&rdquo; replied Mr. Chase promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the Captain was obliged to laugh, although he declared that Mr.
      Young&rsquo;s constancy was a proof that the firm&rsquo;s prospects were good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rats&rsquo;ll always leave a sinkin&rsquo; ship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and if Zoeth and me was
      goin&rsquo; under Rat Young would be the first to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth, when his niece questioned him, expressed confidence that the new
      competitors would not prove dangerous. &ldquo;The Almighty has looked after us
      so far,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;unworthy as we be, and I guess he&rsquo;ll carry us the rest
      of the way. Put your trust in Him, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta; I hope they teach you that
      up to school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mary, who had been rather troubled at the news of Hamilton and
      Company&rsquo;s rivals in the field, dismissed her fears as groundless. Her
      uncles were old-fashioned and a little behind the times in business
      methods, but no doubt those methods were suited to South Harniss and there
      was no cause for worry concerning the firm&rsquo;s future. She made Isaiah
      promise to keep her posted as to developments and went back to Boston and
      her schoolwork.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spring term was an interesting one and there were other interests as
      well. Crawford called more frequently, the plans for Commencement
      requiring a great deal of discussion. Mary&rsquo;s fondness for managing was, or
      should have been, gratified, for the talent was in constant demand. Sam
      Keith, who, after meeting Mary at his cousin&rsquo;s house, had at first
      developed an amazing fondness for that relative&rsquo;s society, now came less
      often. He was in the second stage of the pretty-girl disease mentioned by
      his aunt; the fever and delirium had passed, and he was now cooling off.
      It cannot be said that the fever had been in the least encouraged. Mary
      was pleasant and agreeable when he called, but she would not treat him as
      a confidant or an intimate; she did not accept any of his invitations to
      dances or the theater, and she would not flirt even the least little bit.
      The last was the most unsatisfactory drawback, because the susceptible
      Samuel was fond of flirtations and usually managed to keep at least three
      going at the same time. Therefore, the cooling-off process was, in this
      case, a bit more rapid than usual. Sam&rsquo;s calls and dinners at his cousin
      Emily&rsquo;s residence had decreased from two or three times a week to an
      uncertain once a fortnight. Mary, of course, noticed this, but she felt no
      regret. Crawford, Sam&rsquo;s roommate, must have noticed it also, but if he
      felt regret he managed to conceal the feeling remarkably well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in May Captain Shadrach came up to the city to buy summer goods for
      the store. He positively refused to make his headquarters at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s,
      although that lady sent an urgent invitation to him to do so. And, even
      when Mary added her own plea to that of her landlady, the Captain still
      refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t ask me, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta [he wrote]. For the dear land sakes don&rsquo;t ask me
      to come to that place and stay. I&rsquo;d do &lsquo;most anything for you, and I will
      do that if you are dead sot on it, but I do hope you ain&rsquo;t. I will come up
      there and see you of course and I&rsquo;ll even stay to supper if I get asked,
      but DON&rsquo;T ask me to drop anchor and stay there night and day. I couldn&rsquo;t
      stand it. My backbone&rsquo;s sprung backwards now from settin&rsquo; up so straight
      last time I was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mary had pity upon him and he took a room at the Quincy House where, as
      he said, he didn&rsquo;t have to keep his nose dead on the course every minute,
      but could &ldquo;lay to and be comf&rsquo;table&rdquo; if he wanted to. He was invited to
      supper at the Wyeth house, however, and while there Mrs. Wyeth found an
      opportunity to take him aside and talk with him on a subject which he
      found interesting and a trifle disquieting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now mind,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I am by no means convinced that the affair is
      anything but a mere boy and girl friendship, or that it is ever likely to
      be more than that. But I did think I ought to tell you about it and that
      you should meet the young man. You have met him, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Shadrach, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him. &lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t much more&rsquo;n that&mdash;he
      just came into our store down home, that&rsquo;s all. But I did meet him and I
      must say I thought he was a real likely young feller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you thought so. So do I. Has Mary written you of his calls
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;s written. She ain&rsquo;t the kind of girl to keep
      anything back from us; at least, if she is, she&rsquo;s changed a heap since she
      came away to school. She&rsquo;s told us about his comin&rsquo; here and about you and
      him and her goin&rsquo; to that&mdash;what-d&rsquo;ye-call-it&mdash;hookey game. She
      wrote all about that &lsquo;way last February.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we did go to the hockey game. Samuel, my cousin John Keith&rsquo;s boy,
      played in it. Now, Captain Gould, I have a suggestion to make. It has been
      some years since you met Crawford Smith and I think, everything
      considered, you should meet him again and decide for yourself whether or
      not you still consider him a proper young person to call upon your niece.
      Suppose you dine with us again tomorrow evening and I invite young Smith
      also. Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain interrupted. He had a plan of his own for the following
      evening and another meal at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s was not a part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;excuse me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he cut in hastily, &ldquo;but I had a&mdash;a
      kind of notion that Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and me might get our supper at a&mdash;a
      eatin&rsquo;-house or somewhere tomorrow night and then maybe we&rsquo;d take in&mdash;I
      mean go to a show&mdash;a theater, I should say. I didn&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;d ask
      this young Smith feller to go along. And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; remembering his
      politeness, &ldquo;of course we&rsquo;d be real glad if you&rsquo;d come, too,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Wyeth, although she thanked him and expressed herself as heartily
      in favor of the supper and theater party, refused to become a member of
      it. The Captain bore the shock of the refusal with, to say the least,
      manful resignation. He had a huge respect for Mrs. Wyeth, and he liked her
      because his beloved Mary-&rsquo;Gusta liked her so well, but his liking was
      seasoned with awe and her no in this case was a great relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the following evening at six Mary and her uncle met Crawford at the
      Quincy House and the three dined together, after which they saw the
      performance of &ldquo;The Music Master&rdquo; at the Tremont Theater. Crawford found
      the dinner quite as entertaining as the play. Captain Shadrach was in high
      good humor and his remarks during the meal were characteristic. He
      persisted in addressing the dignified waiter as &ldquo;Steward&rdquo; and in referring
      to the hotel kitchen as the &ldquo;galley.&rdquo; He consulted his young guests before
      ordering and accepted their selections gracefully if not always silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;All right, just as you say. You&rsquo;re
      the skipper of this craft tonight, and me and Crawford here are just
      passengers. If you say we&rsquo;ve got to eat&mdash;what is it?&mdash;consummer
      soup&mdash;why, I suppose likely we have. I&rsquo;ll take my chances if Crawford
      will. Course, if I was alone here, I&rsquo;d probably stick to oyster stew and
      roast beef. I know what they are. And it&rsquo;s some comfort to be sure of what
      you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo;, as the sick feller said when the doctor told him he had
      the smallpox instead of the measles. You don&rsquo;t mind my callin&rsquo; you
      &lsquo;Crawford,&rsquo; do you?&rdquo; he added, turning to that young gentleman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m old
      enough to be your father, for one thing, and for another a handle&rsquo;s all
      right on a jug or a sasspan, but don&rsquo;t seem as if &lsquo;twas necessary to take
      hold of a friend&rsquo;s name by. And I hope we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be friends, we
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford said he hoped so, too, and he said it with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain with enthusiasm. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll cement the
      friendship&mdash;the book fellers are always tellin&rsquo; about cementin&rsquo; 
      friendships&mdash;with this supper of ours, eh? If we only had some of
      Isaiah&rsquo;s last batch of mincemeat we could sartinly do it with that; it was
      the nighest thing to cement ever I saw put on a table. I asked him if he
      filled his pies with a trowel and you ought to have heard him sputter. You
      remember Isaiah, don&rsquo;t you, Crawford? Tall, spindlin&rsquo; critter, sails cook
      for Zoeth and me at the house down home. He ain&rsquo;t pretty, but his heart&rsquo;s
      in the right place. That&rsquo;s kind of strange, too,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle,
      &ldquo;when you consider how nigh his shoulder-blades are to the top of his
      legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between his stories and jokes he found time to ask his male guest a few
      questions and these questions, although by no means offensively personal,
      were to the point. He inquired concerning the young man&rsquo;s home life, about
      his ambitions and plans for the future, about his friends and intimates at
      college. Crawford, without being in the least aware that he was being
      catechized, told a good deal, and Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s appraising regard,
      which had learned to judge men afloat and ashore, read more than was told.
      The appraisal was apparently satisfactory for, after the young man had
      gone and the Captain and Mary were saying good night in the Wyeth parlor,
      Shadrach said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice boy, I should say. Yes, sir, a real nice young feller, as young
      fellers go. I like him fust-rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I like him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach regarded her with a little of the questioning scrutiny he had
      devoted to Crawford during dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, eh?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; repeated Mary, puzzled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean how much do you like him? More&rsquo;n you do your Uncle Zoeth and me,
      for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into his face. What she saw there brought the color to her
      own. He might have said more, but she put her finger-tips upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she said hotly. &ldquo;What wicked, silly nonsense, Uncle Shad!
      Don&rsquo;t you ever, ever say such a thing to me again. You KNOW better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach smiled and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say it again&mdash;not till
      you say it to me fust, at any rate. There, there, dearie! Don&rsquo;t blow me
      clean out of the water. I was only jokin&rsquo;, the same as Isaiah was tryin&rsquo; 
      to that night when you came home for your Christmas vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that kind of joking. I think it&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess maybe &lsquo;tis&mdash;for a spell, anyhow. We&rsquo;ll heave the jokes
      overboard. Yes, I like that Crawford Smith fust-rate. But the funniest
      thing about him is the way he reminds me of somebody else. Who that
      somebody is I can&rsquo;t make out nor remember. Maybe I&rsquo;ll think sometime or
      other, but anyhow I like him now for his own sake. I asked him to come
      down and see us sometime this summer. Wonder if he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta wondered, too, but she would have wondered more had she known
      what that coming summer was to mean to her. The morning after the theater
      party Captain Shadrach called to say good-by to Mrs. Wyeth. That lady
      asked some questions and listened with interest and approval to his report
      concerning Crawford Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were so favorably impressed with the boy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As I
      told you, I like him myself. And you approve of his friendship with your
      niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain rubbed his chin. &ldquo;Why, yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I approve of
      that, all right, and I cal&rsquo;late Zoeth would, too. Fact is, where
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s concerned &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; BUT friendship, so fur, and I
      guess likely &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t on his part, either. If it ever should be more, then&mdash;well,
      then, if he turned out to be all that he&rsquo;d ought to be I can&rsquo;t see where
      we old folks have much right to put our oar in, do you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Mrs. Wyeth was tired of the subject; perhaps she objected to being
      addressed as one of the old folks; at any rate, she made no answer, but
      asked a question instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Gould,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what plans have you and Mr. Hamilton made for
      Mary this summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plans, ma&rsquo;am? Why, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve made any. Of course, we&rsquo;re
      countin&rsquo; on her comin&rsquo; down to South Harniss when she gets through her
      school, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, Captain. I have a friend who is very anxious to have you
      change that plan for one of hers. Come in, Letitia. Captain Gould, this is
      my friend, Miss Pease. Now, Letitia, tell the Captain your plan&mdash;the
      one you told me last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease told of her plan and Captain Shad listened, at first with
      astonishment, then with a troubled expression and at last with a
      combination of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Miss Pease, in conclusion, &ldquo;that is my plan. It means a
      great deal to me and I hope it may mean something to Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a wonderful opportunity for her,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Wyeth
      emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it, Captain Gould?&rdquo; asked Miss Pease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach drew a long breath. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know hardly what to say,
      ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hardly realize it yet, seems so. It sartinly
      would be a wonderful chance for her and it&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; me and Zoeth could
      never give her or think of givin&rsquo;. But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Miss Pease, as he hesitated, &ldquo;if she is needed very much
      at home&mdash;if you feel you cannot spare her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; interrupted the Captain quickly. &ldquo;Land knows Zoeth
      and me would miss her awful, but we wouldn&rsquo;t let that stand in the way&mdash;not
      of anything like this. But&mdash;but&mdash;well, to be right down honest,
      ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we&rsquo;d feel like havin&rsquo; somebody else do so much for
      her. Course we ain&rsquo;t well off, Zoeth and I ain&rsquo;t, but we ain&rsquo;t right down
      poor, either. We&rsquo;ve been used to doin&rsquo; for ourselves and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Miss Pease had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; she broke in hastily. &ldquo;I do hope you haven&rsquo;t made a
      mistake, Captain Gould. I hope you don&rsquo;t think I am offering this as a
      charity or purely as a favor to Mary. No, indeed! I am asking it as a
      favor to myself. I must have a companion, otherwise I cannot go. And Mary
      is just the companion I need. I am very fond of her and I think she likes
      me. I am not going to urge too much, Captain Gould, but I do hope you will
      consider the matter with Mr. Hamilton and let me hear from you soon. And I
      am hoping you will consent. I promise to take good care of your girl and
      bring her back safe and sound in September. And I shall not say one word
      of my great plan to her until you write me that I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Captain Shadrach, the troubled expression still on his face, returned
      on the afternoon train to South Harniss to tell his friend and partner of
      Miss Pease&rsquo;s plan. Mary, who accompanied him to the Boston station,
      wondered why he seemed so preoccupied and quiet. If she had known what his
      thoughts were she would have wondered no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pease planned to travel through Europe during the summer months, and
      she had asked the Captain&rsquo;s permission to take Mary with her as her guest
      and friend and companion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      If time and space did not matter, and if even more important happenings in
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s life were not as close at hand to claim attention, it would
      be interesting to describe at length those of that spring and the summer
      which followed it. Summarized in chronological order, they were these:
      First, the lengthy discussions between the partners concerning Miss
      Pease&rsquo;s plan, discussions which ended by Zoeth, as senior partner, writing
      Miss Pease:
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach and I say yes. We ought to have said it afore but flesh is weak
      and we found it kind of hard to make up our minds to spare our girl all
      summer. But we know we ought to spare her and that it will be a splendid
      chance for her. So we say she shall go and we thank you more than we can
      say. She will need clothes and fixings to take with her and Shadrach and I
      wish to ask if you will be kind enough to help her pick out what she
      needs. Maybe Mrs. Wyeth will help too. It will be a great favor if you two
      will do this, Shadrach and I not being much good at such things. We will
      send the money and will pay for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the breaking of the news to Mary herself. At first, after she
      could be made to believe the whole idea a perfectly serious one and
      realized that a trip to Europe&mdash;her dearest day-dream, even when a
      little girl, and the favorite play with the dolls in the attic at South
      Harniss&mdash;when she at last realized the opportunity that was hers,
      even then she hesitated to accept it. There were her uncles&mdash;they
      needed her so much in the store&mdash;they would miss her so dreadfully.
      She could not go and leave them. The united efforts of Miss Pease and Mrs.
      Wyeth could not alter her determination to remain at home; only a joint
      declaration, amounting to a command and signed by both partners of
      Hamilton and Company, had that effect. She consented then, but with
      reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer sailed from Boston&mdash;Miss Pease&rsquo;s civic loyalty forbade
      her traveling on a New York boat&mdash;on the thirtieth of June, the week
      after Commencement. Mary and Mrs. Wyeth attended the Commencement
      exercises and festivities as Crawford&rsquo;s guest. Edwin Smith, Crawford&rsquo;s
      father, did not come on from Carson City to see his son receive his
      parchment from his Alma Mater. He had planned to come&mdash;Crawford had
      begun to believe he might come&mdash;but at the last moment illness had
      prevented. It was nothing serious, he wrote; he would be well and hearty
      when the boy came West after graduating.
    </p>
    <p>
      God bless you, son [the letter ended]. If you knew what it means for your
      old dad to stay away you&rsquo;d forgive him for being in the doctor&rsquo;s care.
      Come home quick when it&rsquo;s over. There&rsquo;s a four-pound trout waiting for one
      of us up in the lake country somewhere. It&rsquo;s up to you or me to get him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford showed the letter to Mary. He was disappointed, but not so much
      so as the girl expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never really dared to count on his coming,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It has been
      this way so many times. Whenever Dad has planned to come East something
      happens to prevent. Now it has happened again; I was almost sure it would.
      It&rsquo;s a shame! I wanted you to meet him. And I wanted him to meet you,
      too,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary also was a little disappointed. She had rather looked forward to
      meeting Mr. Smith. He was her friend&rsquo;s father, of course, and that of
      itself made him an interesting personality, but there was something more&mdash;a
      sort of mystery about him, inspired in her mind by the photograph which
      Crawford had shown her, which made her curious. The man in the photograph
      resembled Crawford, of course, but she had the feeling that he resembled
      someone else even more&mdash;someone she had known or whose picture she
      had seen. She was sorry she was not to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commencement was a wonderful time. Mary was introduced to dozens of young
      fellows, attended spreads and sings and proms, danced a great deal, was
      asked to dance ever so much more, chatted and laughed and enjoyed herself
      as a healthy, happy, and pretty girl should enjoy a college commencement.
      And on the following Tuesday she and Miss Pease, looking down from the
      steamer&rsquo;s deck, waved their handkerchiefs to Mrs. Wyeth and Zoeth and
      Captain Shadrach and Crawford who, standing on the wharf, waved theirs in
      return as the big ship moved slowly out of the dock and turned her nose
      toward Minot&rsquo;s Light and the open sea. For the first time since Hamilton
      and Company put up a sign both partners had come to Boston together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annabel&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; store,&rdquo; explained Shadrach, &ldquo;and Isaiah&rsquo;s helpin&rsquo;.
      It&rsquo;ll be the blind leadin&rsquo; the blind, I cal&rsquo;late, but we don&rsquo;t care, do
      we, Zoeth? We made up our mind we&rsquo;d see you off, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, if we had to
      swim to Provincetown and send up sky-rockets from Race P&rsquo;int to let you
      know we was there. Don&rsquo;t forget what I told you: If you should get as fur
      as Leghorn be sure and hunt up that ship-chandler name of Peroti. Ask him
      if he remembers Shad Gould that he knew in &lsquo;65. If he ain&rsquo;t dead I bet you
      he&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mary-&rsquo;Gusta sailed away and for ten marvelous weeks daydreams came true
      and attic make-believes turned to realities. War had not yet come to sow
      its seed of steel and fire and reap its harvest of blood and death upon
      the fair valleys and hills of France, and the travelers journeyed
      leisurely from village to cathedral town and from the Seine to the Loire.
      They spent three weeks in Switzerland and two in Italy, returning for the
      final week to London where, under Miss Pease&rsquo;s expert guidance, Mary
      visited the shops, the big ones on Regent and Oxford Streets and the
      smaller, equally fascinating&mdash;and more expensive&mdash;ones on Bond
      Street and Piccadilly, buying presents and remembrances for the folks at
      home. And, at last, came the day when, leaning upon the rail, she saw the
      misty headlands of Ireland sink beneath the horizon and realized that her
      wonderful holiday was over and that she was homeward bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was rather rough and stormy, as westerly voyages are likely to
      be, but the ship was comfortable and speedy and they made good time. Mary
      spent but one day in Boston and, on the morning of the next, started for
      South Harniss. She had one week before school opened and that week was to
      be spent with her uncles; no one else, she vowed, should have a minute of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great were the rejoicings in the white house by the shore that day, and
      marvelous was the dinner Isaiah served in honor of the occasion. Mary was
      obliged to relate the story of her trip from start to finish, while three
      rapt listeners nodded and exclaimed in sympathy or broke in to ask
      questions. She had written faithfully, but, as Isaiah said, &ldquo;writin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t
      tellin&rsquo;.&rdquo; So Mary told and her uncles and Mr. Chase listened and
      questioned. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock that night before anyone thought of
      going to bed, and next morning at the breakfast table the questioning
      began all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wyeth was down at the dock, I presume likely, to meet you when your
      ship made port?&rdquo; queried Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she was there,&rdquo; replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else? How about that young Smith feller? Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he there, too?&rdquo;
       asked Captain Shadrach with elaborate innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary colored just a little. She knew it was foolish; there was no reason
      in the world why she should be embarrassed, but she could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t there. He has not returned from
      the West yet, but he will be in Boston next week when the Medical College
      opens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been havin&rsquo; a good time out West there, has he?&rdquo; inquired the Captain,
      still with studied unconcern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. At least he writes me that he has.&rdquo; She looked from one to the other
      of her trio of listeners and then added: &ldquo;I have some of his letters here
      with me. If you&rsquo;d like to hear them I&rsquo;ll read them aloud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you needn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; protested Shadrach hastily. But after
      another look at him Mary said, &ldquo;I think I will,&rdquo; and departed in search of
      the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad, looking a trifle guilty, glanced at his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t read &lsquo;em unless she wants to, need she, Zoeth?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t mean for her to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s face expressed doubt and disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he said and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary returned bearing the packet of letters, some of which she proceeded
      to read. Crawford had spent the summer either at his home in Carson City
      or in camping with his father in the Sierras, where he had shot and fished
      and apparently enjoyed himself hugely. The letters were frank and
      straightforward, full of fun and exuberance, the sort of letters a robust,
      clean-minded young fellow ought to write and sometimes does. They were not
      sentimental; even Isaiah, with what Captain Shadrach termed his &ldquo;lovesick
      imagination,&rdquo; would not have called them so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partners and Mr. Chase listened with interest to the reading of the
      letters and expressed their approval. Shadrach&rsquo;s applause was loudest of
      all, but he seemed to find difficulty in meeting his niece&rsquo;s eye. Just
      before bedtime, after Zoeth and Isaiah had gone upstairs and he was
      locking up for the night, Mary, whom he supposed had gone also, reentered
      the dining-room and stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said severely, &ldquo;come here a minute and sit down. I want
      to talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him to the big rocker. Then she took the little one beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look me in the face,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; not out of the window&mdash;here.
      Um . . . yes. I don&rsquo;t wonder you turn red. I should think you might be
      ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; stammered Shadrach, turning redder than
      ever. &ldquo;What do you mean? Turnin&rsquo; red! Who&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said the young lady, firmly, &ldquo;and you know it. Now, look me
      straight in the eye. Uncle Shad Gould, don&rsquo;t you think it would have been
      more honorable, if you wished to know whether Crawford Smith and I
      corresponded, to have asked me instead of hinting? Don&rsquo;t you think it
      would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hintin&rsquo;? Why&mdash;why, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, what-what&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was a study in expression. Mary bit her lip, but she managed to
      appear solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, hinting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Instead of asking if Crawford and I had written
      each other you hinted. Well, now you know that we did write, and have
      heard his letters to me, have you any objection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Objection? No, no, course not. Why&mdash;I&mdash;I think &lsquo;twas a fine
      thing. I&mdash;I like to get letters; a heap better than I do to write
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he added truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you ashamed?&rdquo; repeated Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, yes, by the jumpin&rsquo; fire, I am! There! I was ashamed when
      I done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, you see, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I just wanted to know. Your Uncle
      Zoeth and me have been actin&rsquo; as your pilots for a consider&rsquo;ble spell.
      Course you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; big enough now to cruise on your own hook&mdash;that
      is, in reason, you understand&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ve got so
      used to takin&rsquo; an observation every noontime, seein&rsquo; how you&rsquo;re layin&rsquo; 
      your course, you know, that it&rsquo;s hard to lose the habit. Not that Zoeth
      was in on this,&rdquo; he added honestly. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do any of the hintin&rsquo;, as
      you call it. I imagine he&rsquo;ll preach my head off for doin&rsquo; it, when he gets
      me alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve to have it preached off&mdash;or partly off, at any rate. Do
      you beg my pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin sure. I&rsquo;d beg it on my bended knees if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for the
      rheumatiz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won&rsquo;t hint any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary a hint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. If you want me to tell you anything, please ask. You must
      trust me, Uncle Shad. I shall always tell&mdash;when there is anything to
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you will, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. I&rsquo;m ashamed of my hintin&rsquo;. God bless you,
      dearie. Now kiss me good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her and, holding her in his arms, looked fondly down into her
      eyes. And, as she returned his look, suddenly she blushed crimson and hid
      her face in his jacket. Then she broke away and with a good night ran from
      the room and up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked after her, sighed, and, after finishing his locking up,
      went upstairs himself. There was a light in his partner&rsquo;s room and he
      entered to find Mr. Hamilton sitting at the little table with several
      sheets of paper covered with figures spread out before him. The Captain
      was so busy with his own thoughts that, for the moment, he did not notice
      the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s changed into a grown-up woman. Even
      this last summer has changed her. She don&rsquo;t look any older, and she&rsquo;s
      prettier than ever, but she thinks different, and I have a notion that, no
      matter how much we may want to, you and me ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be able to keep
      her to ourselves as we&mdash;Eh?&rdquo; suddenly becoming aware of his friend&rsquo;s
      occupation. &ldquo;Are you still fussin&rsquo; over those things? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you
      not to worry any more, but to turn in and sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth shook his head. His usually placid, gentle face had lost some of its
      placidity. He looked worn and worried and the shadows thrown by the lamp
      deepened the lines in his forehead. He looked up over his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I try not to worry and I try to
      heave my burdens onto the Almighty, same as we&rsquo;re commanded, but I can&rsquo;t
      seem to heave the whole of &lsquo;em there. If things don&rsquo;t pick up pretty soon,
      I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t dare think,&rdquo; he added
      despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheet of paper he was holding rattled as his hand shook. Captain Shad
      scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t have our winter goods to buy,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Our credit&rsquo;s
      good, that&rsquo;s one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is up to now, because the Boston folks don&rsquo;t know. But WE know, or
      we&rsquo;re afraid we know, and that makes it worse. How can we go on buyin&rsquo; 
      from folks that has stood our friends ever since we went into business,
      knowin&rsquo; as we do that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His partner interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anything yet,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Keep a stiff upper lip, Zoeth.
      Nine chances to one we&rsquo;ll weather it all right. WHAT a summer this has
      been! And when I think,&rdquo; he added savagely, &ldquo;of how well we got along
      afore those new stores came it makes me nigh crazy. I&rsquo;ll go out with a
      card of matches some night and burn &lsquo;em down. Damn pirates! Callin&rsquo; 
      themselves good Cape Cod names&mdash;names that don&rsquo;t belong to &lsquo;em!
      Baker&rsquo;s Bazaar! Ugh! Rheinstein&rsquo;s Robbers&rsquo; Roost would be nigher the
      truth. . . . Say, Zoeth, we mustn&rsquo;t hint a word to Mary-&rsquo;Gusta about this.
      We&rsquo;ve got cash enough on hand to pay her clearance charges up there at
      school, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Shadrach, I&rsquo;ve looked out for that. I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d ought to. The
      money maybe had ought to go somewheres else, but&mdash;but right or wrong
      it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; for her and I hope the Lord&rsquo;ll forgive me. And what you say&rsquo;s
      true, she mustn&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re worried. She&rsquo;s so conscientious she might be
      for givin&rsquo; up her schoolin&rsquo; and comin&rsquo; down here to help us. She&rsquo;d be just
      as liable to do it as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, she would. Good thing she thinks she&rsquo;s got money of her own
      and that that money is payin&rsquo; her schoolin&rsquo; bills. She&rsquo;d be frettin&rsquo; all
      the time about the expense if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for that. You and I must pretend
      everything&rsquo;s lovely and the goose hangin&rsquo; high when she&rsquo;s around. And we
      mustn&rsquo;t let Isaiah drop any hints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Isaiah has asked me two or three times lately if the new stores was
      hurtin&rsquo; our trade. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he had some suspicions down
      inside him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! Well, that&rsquo;s all right, so long as they stay inside. If I see signs
      of one of those suspicions risin&rsquo; above his Adam&rsquo;s apple I&rsquo;ll choke &lsquo;em
      down again. I&rsquo;ll put a flea in Isaiah&rsquo;s ear, and I&rsquo;ll put mucilage on its
      feet so&rsquo;s &lsquo;twill stick there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So although Mary did notice that the two new shops in the village seemed
      to be prospering and that business at Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s was not
      rushing even for September, the answers to her questions were so
      reassuring that her uneasiness was driven away. Her Uncle Zoeth evaded
      direct reply and Captain Shadrach prevaricated whole-heartedly and
      cheerfully. Even Isaiah declared that &ldquo;everything and all hands was doin&rsquo; 
      fine.&rdquo; But Mary made him promise that should it ever be otherwise than
      fine he would write her immediately. He gave the promise with some
      reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late if Cap&rsquo;n Shad caught me tellin&rsquo; tales out of school he&rsquo;d go to
      work and turn to and bust me over the head with a marlinespike,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Chase, with the air of one stating a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;Oh, no, he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand back of
      you, Isaiah. Now mind, you are to keep me posted on JUST how things are
      here.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mary went back to Boston and to school, where old acquaintances were
      renewed and new ones made. The Misses Cabot welcomed her with fussy and
      dignified condescension. Barbara Howe hugged and kissed her and vowed she
      had not seen a girl all summer who was half so sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world someone doesn&rsquo;t run off with you and marry you this very
      minute I cannot see,&rdquo; declared the vivacious young lady. &ldquo;If I were a man
      I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary, who was used to Miss Howe&rsquo;s outbursts, merely smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I should hope you would be more
      sensible. No one will run off with me; at least I wouldn&rsquo;t run off with
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Don&rsquo;t you think an elopement is perfectly splendid&mdash;so
      romantic and all that? Suppose you were head over heels in love with
      someone and his people were dead set against his marrying you, wouldn&rsquo;t
      you elope then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shouldn&rsquo;t. I think I should try to find out why they were so
      opposed to me. Perhaps there might be some good reason. If there were no
      good reason, then&mdash;why, then&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know. But I should
      hesitate a long while before I came between a person and his family. It
      must be dreadful to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara laughed. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s done every day in the best
      families, my dear. And then the reconciliation is all the sweeter. You
      just wait! Some of these days I expect to read: &lsquo;Elopement in South
      Harniss High Life. Beautiful Society Maiden Weds Famous Former Football&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;I
      want another F&mdash;Oh, yes, Famous Former Football Favorite.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that
      beautiful? Dear me, how you blush! Or is it sunburn? At any rate, it&rsquo;s
      very becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Famous Former Football Favorite called at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s on the evening
      following that of Mary&rsquo;s return to Boston. He was as big and brown as ever
      and declared that he had had a wonderful vacation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re looking awfully well, too,&rdquo; he exclaimed, inspecting her from
      head to foot. &ldquo;She is, isn&rsquo;t she, Mrs. Wyeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wyeth admitted that she thought so. Crawford nodded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, you are!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt of his sincerity. In fact, the admiration in his voice
      and look was so obvious and unconcealed that Mary, although she could not
      help being pleased, was a little embarrassed. The embarrassment wore away,
      however, when he began to tell of his summer in the Sierras and to ask for
      additional particulars concerning her European trip. He stayed longer than
      usual that evening and came again a few evenings later&mdash;to show them
      some photographs he had taken in the mountains, so he said. And the
      following Sunday he dropped in to accompany them to church. And&mdash;but
      why particularize? Perhaps it will be sufficient to say that during that
      fall and winter the boy and girl friendship progressed as such friendships
      are likely to do. Miss Pease, the romantic, nodded and looked wise and
      even Mrs. Wyeth no longer resented her friend&rsquo;s looks and insinuations
      with the same indignant certainty of denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Letitia,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m beginning to
      think he cares for her and may be really serious about it. Whether or not
      she cares for him is quite another thing and I am sure I shan&rsquo;t presume to
      guess. If she does she keeps it to herself, as she does so many other
      things. She knows how to mind her own business and that is a gift
      possessed by few, Letitia Pease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary went home for the Christmas vacation and spent the holidays, as she
      had spent those of the previous year, in helping her uncles at the store.
      The Christmas trade, although not so brisk as she had seen it, was not so
      bad as to alarm her, and the partners were optimistic as ever. Isaiah, who
      had been talked to like a Dutch uncle by Captain Shad and was consequently
      in deadly fear of the latter&rsquo;s wrath, declared that as far as he could see
      everything was all right. So Mary left South Harniss and returned to
      school and the duties of the winter term with few misgivings concerning
      matters at home. Crawford met her at the train and came to the Pinckney
      Street house that evening to hear the news from the Cape. It was
      surprising, the interest in Cape Cod matters manifested of late by that
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a day in early April, Mary, hurrying to Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s after school,
      found a letter awaiting her. She glanced at the postmark, which was South
      Harniss, and the handwriting, which was Isaiah&rsquo;s, and then laid it aside
      to be read later on at her leisure. After many postponements and with
      considerable reluctance she had accepted an invitation to dine with
      Barbara Howe at the latter&rsquo;s home in Brookline and this evening was the
      time appointed. It would be her first plunge into society&mdash;the home
      life of society, that is. The Howes were an old family, wealthy and
      well-connected, and Mary could not help feeling somewhat nervous at the
      ordeal before her. She knew something of the number and variety of
      expensive gowns possessed by her young hostess and her own limited
      wardrobe seemed doubly limited and plain by comparison. But she summoned
      her unfailing common sense to her rescue and found consolation in the fact
      that Barbara and her people knew she was, comparatively speaking, a poor
      girl, and therefore could hardly have invited her with the expectation of
      seeing her arrayed in fine clothes. And if they had done so&mdash;here was
      a bit of the old Mary-&rsquo;Gusta philosophy&mdash;their opinion was not worth
      consideration anyhow, and the sooner they and she reached mutual disgust
      and parting the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although her best gown was not new nor expensive, and her jewels were
      conspicuous by their absence, the picture she made as she stood before the
      mirror giving the last touches to her hair was distinctly not an
      unpleasing one. Maggie, the maid, who entered the room to announce a
      caller, was extravagant in her praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sure, Miss, you look fine,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re that sweet one look
      at you would sugar a cup of tea. Ah, he&rsquo;ll be that proud of you and he
      ought to be, too. But he&rsquo;s a fine young man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? What are you talking about, Maggie?&rdquo; interrupted Mary. &ldquo;Who will be
      proud of me and who is a fine young fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Why, Mr. Smith, of course; who else? He&rsquo;s down in the parlor waitin&rsquo; 
      for you now. I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;ll be down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Mary could stop her she had left the room and was on her way
      downstairs. Mary followed a moment later. She had not expected a visit
      from Crawford, who had called already that week. She wondered why he had
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him in the parlor. Mrs. Wyeth was out shopping with Miss Pease,
      and he and she were alone. He rose to meet her as she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Crawford,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what is the matter? Has anything happened? Why
      do you look so serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled ruefully. &ldquo;I guess because I am rather serious,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had some news and I came to tell you about it.&rdquo; Then, noticing her
      gown, he added: &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re going out, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out by and by. I am going to dine and spend the evening with
      Barbara Howe. But I am not going yet. Won&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will if you&rsquo;re sure you can spare the time. I hope you can, because&mdash;well,
      because I do want to talk to you. I&rsquo;ve had bad news from home. My father
      is ill&mdash;and in the doctor&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry. I hope it isn&rsquo;t serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is or not. It can&rsquo;t be desperately serious,
      because he wrote the letter himself. But at any rate it&rsquo;s serious enough
      for me. He wants me to give up my work here at the Harvard Medical and
      come West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary gasped. &ldquo;Give it up!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Give up your studies? Give up
      medicine? Surely he doesn&rsquo;t want you to do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford shook his head. &ldquo;No, not quite that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do
      that, even for him. But he writes that he is not well and is not likely to
      be better for a good while, if ever, and he would be very much happier if
      I were nearer at hand. He wants me to give up here at the Harvard Med. and
      take up my work again at Denver or Salt Lake City or somewhere out there.
      Even Chicago would seem much nearer, he says. It&rsquo;s a pitiful sort of
      letter. The old chap seems dreadfully down in the dumps. He wants me,
      that&rsquo;s plain enough, and he seems to think he needs me. Says if I were at
      Denver I could come home every little while, whereas here I can&rsquo;t. What
      ought I to do? I hate to say no, and I hate just as much to say yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must decide for yourself,&rdquo; she said after a moment. &ldquo;You have
      your career to consider, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. But, to be perfectly honest, I suppose my career would not
      be influenced greatly if I went. There are plenty of good medical colleges
      in the West. It is only that I am a Harvard man and I hoped to finish at
      the Harvard school, that is all. But I COULD go. What do you advise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mary took time for consideration. Her face now was as grave as his.
      At last she said, without raising her eyes: &ldquo;I think you ought to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He groaned. &ldquo;I was afraid you would say that,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;And I suppose
      you are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I am. If your father needs you and wants you, and if your
      career will not be influenced for harm, I&mdash;well, I think you should
      do as he wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my own wishes shouldn&rsquo;t count, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not in this case; not much, at any rate. Do you think they
      should?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. But&mdash;but yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do YOU want me to go away?&rdquo; He leaned forward in his chair and
      repeated earnestly: &ldquo;Do you, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and her eyes fell before the look in his. Her heart
      began to beat quickly and she glanced apprehensively toward the partly
      opened door. He rose and closed it. Then he came close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;do you know why this appeal of Dad&rsquo;s has hit
      me so very hard? Why it is going to be so mighty difficult to say yes and
      leave here? It isn&rsquo;t because I hate to give up Harvard. I do hate that, of
      course, but I&rsquo;d do it in a minute for Dad. It isn&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s because I
      can&rsquo;t&mdash;I just can&rsquo;t think of leaving you. You have come to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on, unheeding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come to mean about all there is in life for me,&rdquo; he declared.
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t money or success or reputation I&rsquo;ve been working and plugging
      for these last few months; it&rsquo;s just you. I didn&rsquo;t think so once&mdash;I
      used to think such things were just in books&mdash;but now I know. I love
      you, Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she protested. &ldquo;Oh, Crawford,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you&rsquo;ve got to hear me. It&rsquo;s true; I love you, and if you can care for
      me, I am going to marry you. Not now, of course; I&rsquo;ve got my way to make
      first; but some day, if I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His teeth set in the determined fashion she had learned to know meant
      unswerving purpose. She looked up, saw the expression of his face, and for
      the instant forgot everything except her pride in him and her joy that she
      should have awakened such feelings. Then she remembered other things,
      things which she had spent many hours of many nights in debating and
      considering. As he bent toward her she evaded him and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Crawford! Please!&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t say such things to
      me. It isn&rsquo;t right that you should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked puzzled. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;At any rate, right or wrong, I
      must say them, Mary. I&rsquo;ve been holding them in for months and now I&rsquo;ve
      just got to say them. I love you and I want to marry you. May I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Crawford! No! It is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! Why? Is it&mdash;is it because you don&rsquo;t care for me? Don&rsquo;t
      you, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Look at me! Can&rsquo;t you care, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. But when he took a step toward her she raised her hands in
      protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;we mustn&rsquo;t think&mdash;Oh,
      no, it is impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t impossible. If you love me as I do you it is the only possible
      thing in the world. Listen, dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! I mustn&rsquo;t listen. Be sensible, Crawford! think! We are both so
      young. You are only beginning your studies. It will be years before you
      can&mdash;before you should consider marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can wait. I am willing to wait if you will only promise to wait
      for me. I&rsquo;ll work&mdash;HOW I&rsquo;ll work!&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but we both have others besides ourselves to consider. I have my
      uncles. They have done everything for me. And you have your father. Does
      he know&mdash;about me&mdash;about what you have just said to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now Crawford hesitated. Not long, but long enough for Mary to know
      what the answer would be before it was spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought not. Do you think he will
      approve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will. There is every reason why he should and absolutely none
      why he shouldn&rsquo;t. Of course he&rsquo;ll approve; he&rsquo;s sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he may have plans of his own for you, and your marrying an
      Eastern girl may not be one of them. You have often told me how prejudiced
      he is against the East and Eastern people. He may disapprove strongly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford squared his shoulders. There was no hesitation or doubt in his
      next speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does it will make no difference,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I care a whole lot
      for Dad and I&rsquo;d do anything on earth for him&mdash;anything but the one
      thing, that is: I won&rsquo;t give you up&mdash;provided you care for me&mdash;for
      him or for anyone else. That&rsquo;s final.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He certainly looked as if it were. But Mary only shook her head. In the
      new thoughts and new imaginings which had come to her during the past
      winter there had been a vague foreshadowing of a possible situation
      somewhat like this. She had her answer ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are his son, his only child, Crawford.
      He cares so much for you. You have often told me that, and&mdash;and I
      know he must. And you and he have been so happy together. Do you think I
      would be the cause of breaking that relationship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved the question aside and asked one of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me, Mary?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t ask me, Crawford. Write your father. Tell him everything.
      Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will. I should have done it, anyway. If I go home, and I suppose I
      must, I shall tell him; it will be better than writing. But I want your
      answer before I go. Won&rsquo;t you give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked very handsome and very manly, as he stood there pleading. But
      Mary had made up her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Crawford,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t know. I do know that it
      would not be right for me to say what you want me to say&mdash;now. Go
      home to your father; he needs you. Tell him everything and then&mdash;write
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, a long, long look. Then he nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will. I will tell him that I mean to marry you.
      If he says yes&mdash;as he will, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;then I&rsquo;ll write you that.
      If he says no, I&rsquo;ll write you that. But in either case, Mary Lathrop, I
      shall marry you just the same. Your own no will be the only thing that can
      prevent it. And now may I come and see you tomorrow evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not tomorrow, Crawford. When will you start for home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday, I think. May I come the day after tomorrow? Just to say
      good-by, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was troubled. She could not deny him and yet she was certain it would
      be better for them both if he did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said doubtfully. &ldquo;But only to say good-by. You must promise
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a ring at the bell. Then Maggie, the maid, appeared to announce
      that the Howe motor car was waiting at the curb. A few moments later Mary
      was in her room adjusting her new hat before the mirror. Ordinarily,
      adjusting that hat would have been an absorbing and painstaking
      performance; just now it was done with scarcely a thought. How devoutly
      she wished that the Howe car and the Howe dinner were waiting for anyone
      in the wide world but her! She did not wish to meet strangers; she did not
      wish to go anywhere, above all she did not wish to eat. That evening, of
      all evenings in her life, she wished to be alone. However, accepted
      invitations are implied obligations and Mary, having adjusted the hat,
      gave her eyes a final dab with a handkerchief and cold water and hastened
      down to answer the call to social martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not excruciating torture, that dinner in the Howe dining-room, even
      to a young lady who had just listened to a proposal of marriage and
      desired to think of nothing less important. Mr. Howe was big and jolly.
      Mrs. Howe was gray-haired and gracious and Barbara was&mdash;Barbara.
      Also, there was a friend of Mr. Howe&rsquo;s, an elderly gentleman named Green,
      who it seemed was one of a firm of wholesale grocers downtown, and who
      told funny stories and, by way of proving that they were funny, laughed
      heartiest of all at the ending of each. He sat next Mrs. Howe during
      dinner, but later, when they were all in the handsome drawing-room, he
      came over and seated himself upon the sofa next Mary and entered into
      conversation with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a born Bostonian, I understand, Miss Lathrop,&rdquo; he observed.
      &ldquo;An importation, eh? Ho, ho! Yes. Well, how do you like us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I like Boston very much, Mr. Green,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I
      know it better than any other American city, perhaps that is why. It was
      the only city I had ever seen until quite recently. I am imported&mdash;as
      you call it&mdash;from not so far away. My home is on Cape Cod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Green regarded her with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From Cape Cod, eh? That&rsquo;s rather peculiar. I have been
      very much interested in the Cape for the past day or so. Something has
      occurred in connection with my business which brought the Cape to mind. My
      attention has been&mdash;er&mdash;as you may say, gripped by the strong
      right arm of Massachusetts. Eh? Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled at his own joke. Mary was rather bored, but she tried not to
      show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part of the Cape has interested you, Mr. Green?&rdquo; she inquired for
      the sake of saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;South Harniss. Little town down near the elbow. Do
      you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was surprised, of course. The answer which was on the tip of her
      tongue was naturally, &ldquo;Why, yes, I live there.&rdquo; But she did not make that
      answer, although she has often wondered, since, why. What she said was:
      &ldquo;Yes, I know South Harniss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, indeed?&rdquo; went on Green. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t, but I have known some
      people who live there for ever so long. My father knew them before me.
      They were customers of his and they have been buying of our firm for
      years. Two old chaps who keep what I believe they would call a &lsquo;general
      store.&rsquo; Fine old fellows, both of them! Different as can be, and
      characters, but pure gold inside. I have had some bad news concerning
      them. They&rsquo;re in trouble and I&rsquo;m mighty sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was bored no longer. She leaned forward and asked breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are their names, Mr. Green?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, the firm name is Hamilton and Company. That is simple and sane
      enough, but the names of the partners were cribbed from the book of
      Leviticus, I should imagine&mdash;Zoeth and Shadrach! Ho, ho! Think of it!
      Think of wishing a name like Shadrach upon a helpless infant. The S. P. C.
      A. or C. C. or something ought to be told of it. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud. Mary did not laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;you said they were in trouble,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;What sort of
      trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, the usual kind. The kind of goblin, young lady, which is likely
      to get us business men if we don&rsquo;t watch out&mdash;financial trouble. The
      firm of Hamilton and Company has not kept abreast of the times, that&rsquo;s
      all. For years they did a good business and then some new competitors with
      up-to-date ideas came to town and&mdash;puff!&mdash;good-by to the old
      fogies. They are in a bad way, I&rsquo;m afraid, and will have to go under,
      unless&mdash;eh? But there! you aren&rsquo;t particularly interested, I dare
      say. It was your mention of Cape Cod which set me going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I am interested; I am, really. They must go under, you say? Fail,
      do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is what I mean. I am very sorry. Our firm would go on selling
      them goods almost indefinitely for, as I have said, they are old customers
      and in a way old friends. But they are absolutely honest and they will not
      buy what they cannot pay for. We have some pitiful letters from them&mdash;not
      whining, you know, but straightforward and frank. They don&rsquo;t ask favors,
      but tell us just where they stand and leave it to us to refuse credit if
      we see fit. It is just one of the little tragedies of life, Miss Lathrop,
      but I&rsquo;m mighty sorry for those two old friends of my father&rsquo;s and mine.
      And the worst of it is that, from inquiries I have made, it would seem
      that they have been sacrificing themselves by spending their money
      lavishly and uselessly on someone else. They have a girl in the family, a
      sort of adopted niece, whatever that is, and, not content with bringing
      her up like a sensible, respectable country girl, they must dress her like
      a millionaire&rsquo;s daughter and send her off to some extravagantly expensive
      seminary where&mdash;Why, what is the matter? Eh? Good heavens! What have
      I been saying? You don&rsquo;t know these people, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary turned a very white face toward his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are my uncles,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My home is at South Harniss. Please
      excuse me, Mr. Green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and walked away. A few minutes later, when Mr. Howe approached
      the sofa, he found his friend sitting thereon, staring at nothing in
      particular and fervently repeating under his breath, &ldquo;The devil! The
      devil! The devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary got away as soon as she could. Her looks attracted Barbara&rsquo;s
      attention and the young lady asked if she were not feeling well. Mary
      replied that she was not, and although it was not serious please might she
      be permitted to go home at once? She was sent home in the automobile and
      when she reached her own room her first act was to find and open Isaiah&rsquo;s
      letter which had arrived that afternoon. With trembling fingers she held
      it beneath the gas jet and this is what she read:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MARY AUGUSTA:
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not ought to write you this and your Uncles would pretty nigh kill
      me if they knew I done so but I am going to just the same. Busines has
      gone to rack and ruin. Hamilton &amp; Co. thanks to those and other darned
      stores, ain&rsquo;t making enough to keep boddy and soul together and they are
      making themselves sick over it. I don&rsquo;t know what will become of them to
      if something or someboddy does not think up some way to help them over the
      shoals. They do not tell anyone and least of all they wouldent want you to
      be told, but I think you ought to be. They have done a whole lot for you.
      Can&rsquo;t you think up some way to do something for them. For god Sakes write
      right off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      ISAIAH CHASE. <a name="link2HCH0017" id="link2HCH0017">

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      People grow older, even on the Cape, where hurry&mdash;except by the
      automobiles of summer residents&mdash;is not considered good form and
      where Father Time is supposed to sit down to rest. Judge Baxter, Ostable&rsquo;s
      leading attorney-at-law, had lived quietly and comfortably during the
      years which had passed since, as Marcellus Hall&rsquo;s lawyer, he read the
      astonishing letter to the partners of Hamilton and Company. He was over
      seventy now, and behind his back Ostable folks referred to him as &ldquo;old
      Judge Baxter&rdquo;; but although his spectacles were stronger than at that
      time, his mental faculties were not perceptibly weaker, and he walked with
      as firm, if not so rapid, a stride. So when, at eleven in the forenoon of
      the day following Mary&rsquo;s dinner at the Howes&rsquo; home, the Judge heard
      someone enter the outer room of his offices near the Ostable courthouse,
      he rose from his chair in the inner room and, without waiting for his
      clerk to announce the visitor, opened the door himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The caller whose question the clerk was about to answer, or would probably
      have answered as soon as he finished staring in awestruck admiration, was
      a young lady. The Judge looked at her over his spectacles and then through
      them and decided that she was a stranger. He stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Judge Baxter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you wish to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned toward him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I should like to talk with
      you for a few moments if you are not too busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge hesitated momentarily. Only the week before a persistent and
      fluent young female had talked him into the purchase of a set of &ldquo;Lives of
      the Great Jurists,&rdquo; the same to be paid for in thirty-five installments of
      two dollars each. Mrs. Baxter had pronounced the &ldquo;Great Jurists&rdquo; great
      humbugs, and her husband, although he pretended to find the &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; very
      interesting, was secretly inclined to agree with her. So he hesitated. The
      young woman, evidently noticing his hesitation, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are engaged just now I shall wait. I came to see you on a matter
      of business, legal business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter tried to look as if no thought of his visitor&rsquo;s having
      another purpose had entered his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly! Of course!&rdquo; he said hastily, and added: &ldquo;Will you
      walk in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked in&mdash;to the private office, that is&mdash;and the Judge,
      following her, closed the door. His clerk stared wistfully at his own side
      of that door for a full minute, then sighed heavily and resumed his work,
      which was copying a list of household effects belonging to a late lamented
      who had willed them, separately and individually, to goodness knew how
      many cousins, first, second, and third.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the private office the Judge asked his visitor to be seated. She took
      the chair he brought forward. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me, I think, Judge Baxter. I am Mary Lathrop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge looked puzzled. The name sounded familiar, but he could not seem
      to identify its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would remember me if I told you my whole name,&rdquo; suggested the
      latter. &ldquo;I am Mary Augusta Lathrop. I think perhaps you used to call me
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta; most people did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Judge remembered. His astonishment was great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Are you&mdash;? Why, it
      scarcely seems possible! And yet, now that I look, I can see that it is.
      Bless my soul and body! How do you do? It must be almost&mdash;er&mdash;seven
      or eight years since I have seen you. South Harniss is only a few miles
      off, but I am getting&mdash;er&mdash;older and I don&rsquo;t drive as much as I
      used to. But there! I am very glad to see you now. And how are Captain
      Gould and Mr. Hamilton? There is no need to ask how you are. Your looks
      are the best answer to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary thanked him and said she was very well. Her uncles, too, were well,
      she added, or they were when she last heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am on my way home to them now,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;For the past two years I
      have been at school in Boston. I left there this morning and got off the
      train here because I wished very much to see you, Judge Baxter. Yesterday&mdash;last
      evening&mdash;I heard something&mdash;I was told something which, if it is
      true, is&mdash;is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip. She was evidently fighting desperately not to lose
      self-control. The Judge was surprised and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mary!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I suppose I may call you Mary still; as an old
      friend I hope I may. What is the matter? What did you hear? What do you
      wish to see me about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was calm enough now, but her earnestness was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard something concerning myself and my uncles which surprised and
      shocked me dreadfully,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can hardly believe it, but I must
      know whether it is true or not. I must know at once! You can tell me the
      truth, Judge Baxter, if you only will. That is why I came here this
      morning. Will you tell it to me? Will you promise that you will answer my
      questions, every one, with the exact truth and nothing else? And answer
      them all? Will you promise that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge looked even more surprised and puzzled. He rubbed his chin and
      smiled doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I can promise that if I answer your
      questions at all I shall answer them truthfully. But I scarcely like to
      promise to answer them without knowing what they are. A lawyer has a good
      many secrets intrusted to him and he is obliged to be careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But this is a secret in which I am interested. I am interested in
      it more than anyone else. I must know the truth about it! I MUST! If you
      won&rsquo;t tell me I shall find out somehow. WILL you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter rubbed his chin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better ask your questions?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; yes, I do. I will. How much money did my stepfather, Captain
      Marcellus Hall, have when he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge&rsquo;s chin-rubbing ceased. His eyebrows drew together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo; he asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I do. Because it is very important that I should. It is my right
      to know. Was he a rich man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;er&mdash;no. I should not call him that. Hardly a rich man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he very poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, I don&rsquo;t exactly see why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Oh, Judge Baxter, please don&rsquo;t think I am asking this for any
      selfish reasons. I am not, indeed I&rsquo;m not! All my life, ever since I was
      old enough to think of such things at all, I have supposed&mdash;I have
      been led to believe that my stepfather left me plenty of money&mdash;money
      enough to pay my uncles for taking care of me, for my clothes and board,
      and now, during these last two years, for my studies in Boston. I never,
      never should have consented to go to that school if I hadn&rsquo;t supposed I
      was paying the expenses myself. I knew my uncles were not well-to-do; I
      knew they could not afford to&mdash;to do what they had already done for
      me, even before that. And now&mdash;last night&mdash;I was told that&mdash;that
      they were in great financial trouble, that they would probably be obliged
      to fail in business, and all because they had been spending their money on
      me, sacrificing themselves and their comfort and happiness in order that
      &lsquo;an adopted niece with extravagant ideas&rsquo; might be educated above her
      station; that is the way the gentleman who told me the story put it. Of
      course he didn&rsquo;t know he was talking to the niece,&rdquo; she added, with a
      pathetic little smile; &ldquo;but, oh, Judge, can&rsquo;t you see now why I must know
      the truth&mdash;all of the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers clasped and unclasped in her lap. The Judge laid his own hand
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, my dear,&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut! What&rsquo;s all
      this about your uncles failing in business? That isn&rsquo;t possible, is it?
      Tell me the whole thing, just as it was told to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mary told it, concluding by exhibiting Isaiah Chase&rsquo;s letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very bad, you see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isaiah never would have written
      if it had not been. It is hard enough to think that while I was enjoying
      myself in Europe and at school they were in such trouble and keeping it
      all to themselves. That is hard enough, when I know how they must have
      needed me. But if it should be true that it is their money&mdash;money
      they could not possibly spare&mdash;that I have been spending&mdash;wasting
      there in Boston, I&mdash;I&mdash;Please tell me, Judge Baxter! Have I any
      money of my own? Please tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge rose and walked up and down the floor, his brows drawn together
      and his right hand slapping his leg at each turn. After seven or eight of
      these turns he sat down again and faced his caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;suppose this story about your uncles&rsquo; financial and
      business troubles should be true, what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary met his look bravely. Her eyes were moist, but there was no
      hesitation in her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay at home and help them in any way I can,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There
      will be no more Boston and no more school for me. They need me there at
      home and I am going home&mdash;to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether it is your money or theirs which has paid for your education?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Of course I never should have gone away at all if I had not
      supposed my own money were paying the expenses. Judge, you haven&rsquo;t
      answered my question&mdash;and yet I think&mdash;I am afraid that you have
      answered it. It was their money that paid, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter was silent for a moment, as if in final deliberation. Then he
      nodded, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was their money. In fact, it has been their
      money which has paid for most things in your life. Shadrach Gould and
      Zoeth Hamilton aren&rsquo;t, maybe, the best business men in the world, but they
      come pretty near to being the best MEN, in business or out of it, that I
      have met during seventy odd years on this planet. I think, perhaps, it
      will be well for you to know just how good they have been to you. Now,
      listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began at the beginning, at the day of Marcellus Hall&rsquo;s funeral, when he
      read the letter to Shadrach and Zoeth, the letter intrusting Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      to their care. He told of Marcellus&rsquo;s unfortunate investments, of the loss
      of the latter&rsquo;s fortune, and how, when the estate was settled, there were
      but a few hundreds where it was expected there might be a good many
      thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any mistake, Mary,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Your uncles knew there
      was little or no money when they decided to take you. They took you simply
      for yourself, because they cared so much for you, not because they were to
      make a cent from the guardianship. Everything you have had for the past
      two years their money has paid for and you may be absolutely certain they
      never have grudged a penny of it. The last time I saw Captain Gould he was
      glorying in having the smartest and best girl in Ostable County. And Mr.
      Hamilton&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, please!&rdquo; she said chokingly. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t
      tell me any more just now. I&mdash;I want to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any more to tell,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I am going into the next
      room. I shall be back in a few minutes. Then, if you care to, we can talk
      a little more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he returned she had risen and was standing by the window looking out
      into the back yard. She was calm and even smiled a little as he entered,
      although the smile was a rather pitiful one. Of the two the Judge looked
      the more perturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed, after carefully closing the door behind him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been doing a little thinking my self, young lady, since I left you here.
      I&rsquo;ve been thinking that I had better take a trip to Canada or China or
      somewhere and start in a hurry, too. When your uncles find out that I told
      you this thing they have succeeded in keeping from you all this time&mdash;well,
      it will be high time for me to be somewhere else.&rdquo; He laughed and then
      added gravely: &ldquo;But I still think I was right in telling you. Under the
      circumstances it seems to me that you should know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should. If you had not told me I should have found it out,
      now that my suspicions were aroused. Thank you, Judge Baxter. Now I must
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go? Go where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home&mdash;to South Harniss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You&rsquo;re not going to South Harniss yet awhile. You&rsquo;re going to
      have dinner with my wife and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I can&rsquo;t. I must go at once. By the next train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any train until nearly four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; Then, noticing her look
      of disappointment, he went on to say: &ldquo;But that shan&rsquo;t make any
      difference. I&rsquo;ll send you over in my nephew&rsquo;s automobile. I&rsquo;m not
      sufficiently up-to-date to own one of the cussed&mdash;excuse me things,
      but he does and I borrow it occasionally. I don&rsquo;t drive it; good heavens,
      no! But his man shall drive you over and I&rsquo;ll guarantee you beat the
      train. If you don&rsquo;t, it won&rsquo;t be because you go too slow. Now, of course,
      you&rsquo;ll stay to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, Judge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I thank
      you very much, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t you see? I couldn&rsquo;t eat,
      or even try to&mdash;now. I want to get home&mdash;to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you shall, my dear. And in double-quick time, too. Here, Jesse,&rdquo;
       opening the door to the outer office and addressing the clerk, &ldquo;you step
      over and tell Samuel that I want to borrow his car and Jim for two hours.
      Tell him I want them now. And if his car is busy go to Cahoon&rsquo;s garage and
      hire one with a driver. Hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mary,&rdquo; turning to her, &ldquo;can you tell me any more about your
      plans, provided you have had time to make any? If this story about your
      uncles&rsquo; business troubles is true, what do you intend doing? Or don&rsquo;t you
      know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary replied that her plans were very indefinite, as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some ideas,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;some that I had thought I might use after
      I had finished school and come back to the store. They may not be worth
      much; they were schemes for building up the business there and adding some
      other sorts of business to it. The first thing I shall do is to see how
      bad the situation really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it isn&rsquo;t bad. Poor Zoeth certainly has had trouble enough in his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a significance in his tone which Mary plainly did not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trouble do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge looked at her, coughed, and then said hastily: &ldquo;Oh, nothing in
      particular; every one of us has troubles, I suppose. But, Mary, if&mdash;if
      you find that the story is true and&mdash;ahem&mdash;a little money might
      help to&mdash;er&mdash;tide the firm over&mdash;why, I&mdash;I think
      perhaps that it might be&mdash;ahem&mdash;arranged so that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be having difficulty in finishing the sentence. Mary did not
      wait to hear the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Judge,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Thank you, but I am hoping it may
      not be so bad as that. I am going back there, you know, and&mdash;well, as
      Uncle Shadrach would say, we may save the ship yet. At any rate, we won&rsquo;t
      call for help until the last minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Baxter regarded her with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach and Zoeth are rich in one respect,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve got
      you. But it is a wicked shame that you must give up your school and your
      opportunities to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;If you knew how glad I am to be able to do
      something, if it is only to give up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The car and Jim were at the door a few minutes later and Mary, having said
      good-by to the Judge and promised faithfully to keep him posted as to
      events at home, climbed into the tonneau and was whizzed away. Jim, the
      driver, after a few attempts at conversation, mainly concerning the
      &ldquo;unseasonableness&rdquo; of the weather, finding responses few and absently
      given, relapsed into silence. Silence was what Mary desired, silence and
      speed, and Jim obliged with the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the road by which, a dozen years before, she had driven in the old
      buggy she now rode again. Then, as now, she wondered what she should find
      at her journey&rsquo;s end. Here, however, the resemblance ceased, for whereas
      then she looked forward, with a child&rsquo;s anticipations, to nothing more
      definite than new sights and new and excitingly delightful adventures, now
      she saw ahead&mdash;what? Great care and anxiety and trouble certainly,
      these at the best; and at the worst, failure and disappointment and
      heartbreak. And behind her she was leaving opportunity and the pleasant
      school life and friends, leaving them forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was leaving Crawford, too, leaving him without a word of explanation.
      She had had no time to write even a note. Mrs. Wyeth, after protesting
      vainly against her guest&rsquo;s decision to leave for the Cape by the earliest
      train in the morning, had helped to pack a few essential belongings; the
      others she was to pack and send later on, when she received word to do so.
      The three, Mrs. Wyeth, Miss Pease, and Mary, had talked and argued and
      planned until almost daylight. Then followed an hour or two of uneasy
      sleep, a hurried breakfast, and the rush to the train. Mary had not
      written Crawford; the shock of what she had been told at the Howes&rsquo; and
      her great anxiety to see Judge Baxter and learn if what she had heard was
      true had driven even her own love story from her mind. Now she remembered
      that she had given him permission to call, not this evening but the next,
      to say good-by before leaving for the West. He would be disappointed, poor
      fellow. Well, she must not think of that. She must not permit herself to
      think of anyone but her uncles or of anything except the great debt of
      love and gratitude she owed them and of the sacrifice they had made for
      her. She could repay a little of that sacrifice now; at least she could
      try. She would think of that and of nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she wondered what Crawford would think or say when he found she
      had gone.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The main street of South Harniss looked natural enough as the motor car
      buzzed along it. It was but a few months since Mary had been there, yet it
      seemed ever so much more. She felt so much older than on those Christmas
      holidays. When the store of Hamilton and Company came in sight she sank
      down on the back seat in order not to be seen. She knew her uncles were,
      in all probability, there at the store, and she wished to see Isaiah and
      talk with him before meeting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah was in the kitchen by the cookstove when she opened the door. He
      turned, saw her, and stood petrified. Mary entered and closed the door
      behind her. By that time Mr. Chase had recovered sufficiently from his
      ossification to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;eh&mdash;by time!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I snum if it ain&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;Isaiah,&rdquo; she asked quickly, &ldquo;are you alone? Are my uncles,
      both of them, at the store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the cook and steward had not yet completely got over the effect of the
      surprise. He still stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS you, ain&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;by time, I do
      believe you&rsquo;ve come home, same as I asked you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve come home. How in the world could I be here if I hadn&rsquo;t?
      DON&rsquo;T stare at me like that, with your mouth open like a&mdash;like a
      codfish. Tell me, are Uncle Shad and Uncle Zoeth at the store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;Yes, I cal&rsquo;late they be. Ain&rsquo;t neither of &lsquo;em come home to
      dinner yet. I&rsquo;m expectin&rsquo; one of &lsquo;em &lsquo;most any minute. I&rsquo;ll run up and
      fetch &lsquo;em. Say! How in the nation did you get here this time of day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tell you by and by. No, I don&rsquo;t want you to get my uncles. I want
      to talk with you alone first. Now, Isaiah, sit down! Sit down in that
      chair. I want you to tell me just how bad things are. Tell me everything,
      all you know about it, and don&rsquo;t try to make the situation better than it
      is. And please HURRY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah, bewildered but obedient, sat down. The command to hurry had the
      effect of making him so nervous that, although he talked enough to have
      described the most complicated situation, his ideas were badly snarled and
      Mary had to keep interrupting in order to untangle them. And, after all,
      what he had to tell was not very definite. Business was bad at the store;
      that was plain to everyone in town. &ldquo;All hands&rdquo; were trading at the new
      stores where prices were lower, stocks bigger and more up-to-date, and
      selling methods far, far in advance of those of Hamilton and Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the only customers that stick by us,&rdquo; declared Isaiah, &ldquo;are folks
      like &lsquo;Rastus Young and the rest of the deadbeats. THEY wouldn&rsquo;t leave us
      for nothin&rsquo;&mdash;and nothin&rsquo;s what they pay, too, drat &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners had not told him of their troubles, but telling was not
      necessary. He had seen and heard enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are right on the ragged edge of goin&rsquo; on the rocks,&rdquo; vowed Isaiah.
      &ldquo;Zoeth, he&rsquo;s that thin and peaked &lsquo;twould make a sick pullet look fleshy
      alongside of him. And Cap&rsquo;n Shad goes around with his hands rammed down in
      his beckets&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his britches pockets, and he don&rsquo;t scurcely speak a word for hours at
      a stretch. And they&rsquo;re up all times of the night, fussin&rsquo; over account
      books and writin&rsquo; letters and I don&rsquo;t know what all. It&rsquo;s plain enough
      what&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;. Everybody in town is on to it. Why, I was up to the store
      t&rsquo;other day settin&rsquo; outside on the steps and Ab Bacheldor came along. He
      hates Cap&rsquo;n Shad worse&rsquo;n pizen, you know. &lsquo;Hello, Isaiah!&rsquo; he says to me,
      he says. &lsquo;Is that you?&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Course it&rsquo;s me,&rsquo; says I. Who&rsquo;d you think
      &lsquo;twas?&rsquo; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know but it might be the sheriff,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I
      understand he&rsquo;s settin&rsquo; round nowadays just a-waitin&rsquo;.&rsquo; And Zoeth was
      right within hearin&rsquo;, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup, that&rsquo;s what he said,&rdquo; went on Isaiah. &ldquo;But I got in one dig on my
      own hook. &lsquo;The sheriff don&rsquo;t wait much down to your house, Abner, does
      he?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;You bet he don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;he don&rsquo;t have to.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;d
      starve to death if he waited there long,&rsquo; says I. Ho, ho! His wife&rsquo;s the
      stingiest woman about her cookin&rsquo; that there is on the Cape. Why, one time
      she took a notion she&rsquo;d keep boarders and Henry Ryder, that drives the
      fruit cart, he started to board there. But he only stayed two days. The
      fust day they had biled eggs and the next day they had soup made out of
      the shells. Course that probably ain&rsquo;t true&mdash;Henry&rsquo;s an awful liar&mdash;but
      all the same&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind Henry Ryder, or Abner Bacheldor, either,&rdquo; interrupted Mary.
      &ldquo;How did you happen to send for me, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, that just came of itself, as you might say. I kept gettin&rsquo; more
      and more tittered up and worried as I see how things was goin&rsquo; and I kept
      wishin&rsquo; you was here, if &lsquo;twas only to have somebody to talk it over with.
      But I didn&rsquo;t dast to write and when you was home Christmas I never dast to
      say nothin&rsquo; because Cap&rsquo;n Shad had vowed he&rsquo;d butcher me if I told tales
      to you about any home troubles. That&rsquo;s it, you see! All through this their
      main idea has been not to trouble you. &lsquo;She mustn&rsquo;t know anything or
      she&rsquo;ll worry,&rsquo; says Zoeth, and Cap&rsquo;n Shad he says, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rsquo; They think
      an awful sight of you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary did not trust herself to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go on, Isaiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I kept thinkin&rsquo; and thinkin&rsquo; and one day last week Ezra Hopkins,
      that&rsquo;s the butcher cart feller, he and me was talkin&rsquo; and he says: &lsquo;Trade
      ain&rsquo;t very brisk up to the store, is it?&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Everybody says
      &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then if everybody knows so much what d&rsquo;ye ask me for?&rsquo; says I.
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get mad,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;But I tell you this, Isaiah,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;if
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop hadn&rsquo;t gone away to that fool Boston school things
      would have been different with Hamilton and Company. She&rsquo;s a smart girl
      and a smart business woman. I believe she&rsquo;d have saved the old fellers,&rsquo; 
      he says. &lsquo;She was up-to-date and she had the know-how,&rsquo; says he. Well, I
      kept thinkin&rsquo; what he said and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I wrote. For the land
      sakes don&rsquo;t tell Shad nor Zoeth that I wrote, but I&rsquo;m glad I done it. I
      don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s you can do anything, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s anybody can, but I&rsquo;m
      mighty glad you&rsquo;re here, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I am here, too, Isaiah,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;although I,
      too, don&rsquo;t know that I can do anything. But,&rdquo; she added solemnly, &ldquo;I am
      going to try very hard. Now we mustn&rsquo;t let Uncle Shad or Uncle Zoeth know
      that I have heard about their trouble. We must let them think I am at home
      for an extra holiday. Then I shall be able to look things over and perhaps
      plan a little. When I am ready to tell what I mean to do I can tell the
      rest. . . . Sshh! Here comes one of them now. It&rsquo;s Uncle Zoeth. Look
      happy, Isaiah! HAPPY&mdash;not as if you were choking to death! Well,
      Uncle Zoeth, aren&rsquo;t you surprised to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised he certainly was; at first, like Isaiah, he could scarcely
      believe she was really there. Then, naturally, he wished to know WHY she
      was there. She dodged the questions as best she could and Zoeth, innocent
      and truthful as always, accepted without a suspicion her vague explanation
      concerning an opportunity to run down and see them for a little while.
      Dinner was put on the table and then Isaiah hastened up to relieve
      Shadrach at the store in order that the partners and Mary might eat
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain arrived a few minutes later, red-faced, vociferous, and
      joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he shouted, throwing his arms about her and kissing her with a
      smack which might have been heard in Abner Bacheldor&rsquo;s yard, &ldquo;if THIS
      ain&rsquo;t a surprise! Zoeth said this mornin&rsquo; he felt as if somethin&rsquo; was
      goin&rsquo; to happen, and then Isaiah upset the tea kittle all over both my
      feet and I said I felt as if it HAD happened. But it hadn&rsquo;t, had it! Well,
      if it ain&rsquo;t good to look at you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! How&rsquo;d you happen to come
      this time of year? Has the schoolhouse foundered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary repeated the excuse she had given Mr. Hamilton. It was sufficient.
      The partners were too happy at having her with them to be overcurious
      concerning her reasons for coming. Captain Shad talked and joked and
      laughed and Zoeth nodded and smiled in his quiet way. If Mary had not
      known their secret she would not have guessed it but, as it was, she
      noticed how pale and worn Mr. Hamilton looked and how the Captain had
      become prone to fits of unwonted silence from which he seemed to arouse
      himself with an effort and, after a glance at her, to talk and laugh
      louder than ever, Once she ventured to ask how business was and it would
      have been almost funny if it had not been so pathetic, the haste with
      which they both assured her that it was about the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she announced her intention of going up to the store. Her
      uncles exchanged looks and then Zoeth said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you do that, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? Nice day like this I&rsquo;d be out of
      door if I was you. We don&rsquo;t need you at the store, do we, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more&rsquo;n a fish needs a bathin&rsquo; suit,&rdquo; declared the Captain, with
      conviction. &ldquo;You go see some of the girls and have a good time,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary declined to go and see any of the girls. She could have a better
      time at the store than anywhere else, she said. She went to the store and
      spent the afternoon and evening there, watching and listening. There was
      not much to watch, not more than a dozen customers during the entire time,
      and those bought but little. The hardest part of the experience for her
      was to see how eager her uncles were to please each caller and how
      anxiously each watched the other&rsquo;s efforts and the result. To see Zoeth at
      the desk poring over the ledger, his lips moving and the pencil trembling
      in his fingers, was as bad as, but no worse than, to see Captain Shadrach,
      a frown on his face and his hands in his pockets, pace the floor from the
      back door to the front window, stop, look up the road, draw a long breath
      that was almost a groan, then turn and stride back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock Mary, who had reasons of her own for wishing to be left
      alone in the store, suggested that she remain there while her uncles went
      home for supper. Neither Mr. Hamilton nor the Captain would consent, so
      she was obliged to go to the house herself and send Isaiah up once more to
      act as shopkeeper. But at eleven that night, after unmistakable sounds
      from their rooms were furnishing proofs that both partners of Hamilton and
      Company were asleep, she tiptoed downstairs, put on her coat and hat, took
      the store keys from the nail where Zoeth always hung them, and went out.
      She did not return until almost three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she spent, for the most part, at the store. She wrote several
      letters and, in spite of her uncles&rsquo; protests, waited upon several
      customers. That evening, as she sat behind the counter thinking, a boy
      whom Captain Shadrach identified as Zenas Atkins&rsquo; young-one rushed
      breathlessly into the store to announce between gasps that &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta
      Lathrop&rsquo;s wanted on the phone. It&rsquo;s long distance, too, and&mdash;and&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      got to scrabble &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re holdin&rsquo; the wire.&rdquo; Mary hurried out and to
      the telephone office. She had not answered Shadrach&rsquo;s question as to who
      she thought was calling. She did not know, of course, but she suspected,
      and for a cool-headed young business woman, a girl who had ruthlessly
      driven all thoughts except those of business from her mind, her heart beat
      surprisingly fast as she entered the closet which acted as a substitute
      for a telephone booth, and took down the receiver. Yet her tone was calm
      enough as she uttered the stereotyped &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wire hummed and sang, fragments of distant conversation became audible
      and were lost, and then a voice, the voice which she was expecting but, in
      a way, dreading to hear, asked: &ldquo;Hello! Is this Miss Lathrop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Crawford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just called at Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s and learned that you had gone. I am
      awfully disappointed. I leave for home tomorrow and I had counted on
      seeing you before I went. Why did you go without a word to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Wyeth tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me a good deal, but I want to know more. Is it true&mdash;that
      about your uncles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, that&rsquo;s too bad! I am mighty sorry to hear it. Look here,
      isn&rsquo;t there something I can do? Do they need&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh! we mustn&rsquo;t talk about it over the phone. No, there is nothing you
      can do. I have some plans partially worked out; something may come of
      them. Please don&rsquo;t ask more particulars now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I understand; I won&rsquo;t. But mayn&rsquo;t I come down and see you? I
      can start West the day after tomorrow just as well and that would give me
      time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Crawford, no. You mustn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to, whether or no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do I shall not see you&mdash;then or at any other time. But you
      won&rsquo;t, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mary, I won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s mighty hard, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was quite as hard for her, but she did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you write me&mdash;every day?&rdquo; he went on. . . . &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking what would be best for me to do,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;best for us
      both, I mean. I shall write you one letter surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ONE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One surely. I want you to understand just what my coming here means and
      what effect it may have upon my future. You should know that. Afterward,
      whether I write you or not will depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depend! Of course you&rsquo;ll write me! Depend on what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what seems right to me after I have had time to think, and after you
      have seen your father. I must go, Crawford. Thank you for calling me. I am
      glad you did. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Mary, don&rsquo;t go! Let me say this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Crawford! I&rsquo;d rather you wouldn&rsquo;t say any more. You understand
      why, I&rsquo;m sure. I hope you will have a pleasant trip home and find your
      father&rsquo;s health much improved. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hung up the receiver and hastened back to the store. Shadrach and
      Zoeth looked at her questioningly. Finally the former said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything important, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad, not very important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short interval of silence, then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wyeth callin&rsquo;, I presume likely, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach asked no more questions, and Zoeth asked none. Neither of them
      again mentioned Mary&rsquo;s call to the phone, either to her or to each other.
      And she did not refer to it. She had promised her Uncle Shadrach, when he
      questioned her the year before concerning Crawford, to tell him &ldquo;when
      there was anything to tell.&rdquo; But was there anything to tell now? With the
      task which she had set herself and the uncertainty before her she felt
      that there was not. Yet to keep silence troubled her. Until recently there
      had never been a secret between her uncles and herself; now there were
      secrets on both sides.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      At twelve o&rsquo;clock on a night late in the following week Captain Shadrach,
      snoring gloriously in his bed, was awakened by his partner&rsquo;s entering the
      room bearing a lighted lamp. The Captain blinked, raised himself on his
      elbow, looked at his watch which was on the chair by the bed&rsquo;s head, and
      then demanded in an outraged whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the nation are you prowlin&rsquo; around this hour of the night for?
      You don&rsquo;t want to talk about those divilish bills and credits and things,
      I hope. What&rsquo;s the use? Talkin&rsquo; don&rsquo;t help none! Jumpin&rsquo; fire! I went to
      bed so&rsquo;s to forget &lsquo;em and I was just beginnin&rsquo; to do it. Now you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth held up his hand. &ldquo;Sshh! sshh!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach! I
      didn&rsquo;t come to talk about those things. Shadrach, there&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      somethin&rsquo; queer goin&rsquo; on. Get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was out of bed in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he demanded, in a whisper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s queer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t exactly know. I heard somebody movin&rsquo; downstairs and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach grunted. &ldquo;Isaiah!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Walkin&rsquo; in his sleep again,
      I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! It ain&rsquo;t Isaiah. Isaiah ain&rsquo;t walked in his sleep since he was a
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s pretty nigh his second childhood now, judgin&rsquo; by the way he
      acts sometimes. It was Isaiah of course! Who else would be walkin&rsquo; around
      downstairs this time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, so I went and looked. Shadrach, it was
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Hush! Let me tell you! She had her things on, hat and all,
      and she took the lantern and lit it and went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went OUT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and&mdash;and up the road. Now, where&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach&rsquo;s answer was to stride to the window, pull aside the shade and
      look out. Along the lane in the direction of the village a fiery spark was
      bobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she goes now,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty nigh to the corner
      already. What in the world can she be up to? Where is she bound&mdash;at
      twelve o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth did not answer. His partner turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell me the whole of it while you&rsquo;re
      about it? You&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; back. Out with it! Do YOU know where
      she&rsquo;s bound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth looked troubled&mdash;and guilty. &ldquo;Why, no, Shadrach,&rdquo; he faltered,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but&mdash;but I kind of suspect. You see, she&mdash;she did
      the same thing last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She DID! And you never said a word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what to say. I heard her go and I looked out of the window
      and saw her. She come back about three. I thought sure she&rsquo;d speak of it
      this mornin&rsquo;, but she didn&rsquo;t and&mdash;and&mdash;But tonight I watched
      again and&mdash;Shadrach, she&rsquo;s taken the store keys. Anyhow, they&rsquo;re gone
      from the nail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain wiped his forehead. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to the store, then,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo;! That&rsquo;s a relief, anyhow. I was afraid&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;Whew! I don&rsquo;t know WHAT I didn&rsquo;t know! But what on earth has
      she gone to the store for? And last night too, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Shadrach, I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; and all I can think of is that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;that she suspicions how things are with us&mdash;somebody that
      does suspicion has dropped a hint and she has&mdash;has gone up to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do what? Chuck it overboard! Speak it out! To do what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look at the books or somethin&rsquo;. She knows the combination of the safe,
      you recollect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s eyes and mouth opened simultaneously. He made a dive
      for the hooks on the bedroom wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire of brimstone!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Give me my clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later an interested person&mdash;and, so far as that goes, at
      least every second person in South Harniss would have been interested had
      he or she been aware of what was going on&mdash;an interested and, of
      course, unscrupulous person peeping in under the shades of Hamilton and
      Company&rsquo;s window would have seen a curious sight. This person would have
      seen two elderly men sitting one upon a wooden chair and the other upon a
      wooden packing case and wearing guilty, not to say hang-dog, expressions,
      while a young woman standing in front of them delivered pointed and
      personal remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach and Zoeth, following their niece to the store, had peeped
      in and seen her sitting at the desk, the safe open, and account books and
      papers spread out before her. A board in the platform creaked beneath the
      Captain&rsquo;s weighty tread and Mary looked up and saw them. Before they could
      retreat or make up their minds what to do, she had run to the door, thrown
      it open, and ordered them to come in. Neither answered&mdash;they could
      not at the moment. The certainty that she knew what they had tried so hard
      to conceal kept them tongue-tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; repeated Mary. &ldquo;Come in! And shut the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came in. Also Captain Shadrach shut the door. Just why he obeyed
      orders so meekly he could not have told. His niece gave him little time to
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not exactly expect you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but, on the whole, I am glad
      you came. Now sit down, both of you, and listen to me. What do you mean by
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth sat, without a word. Shadrach, however, made a feeble attempt to
      bluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do WE mean by it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What do YOU mean, you mean!
      Perusin&rsquo; up here in the middle of the night without a word to your Uncle
      Zoeth and me, and&mdash;and haulin&rsquo; open that safe&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mary interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, Uncle Shad!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Sit down! Sit down on that box and
      listen to me! That&rsquo;s right. Now tell me! Why have you been telling me fibs
      for almost a year? Answer me! Why have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth looked at Shadrach and the latter looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fibs?&rdquo; stammered Mr. Hamilton. &ldquo;Fibs? Why&mdash;why, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fibs. I might use a stronger word and not exaggerate very much. You
      have led me to think that business was good, that you were doing as well
      or better than when I was here with you. I asked you over and over again
      and you invariably gave me that answer. And now I know that during all
      that time you have scarcely been able to make ends meet, that you have
      been worrying yourselves sick, that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad could stand it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t, neither!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I never was better in my life. I ain&rsquo;t
      had a doctor for more&rsquo;n a year. And then I only had him for the heaves&mdash;for
      the horse&mdash;a horse doctor, I mean. What are you talkin&rsquo; about! Sick
      nothin&rsquo;! If that swab of an Isaiah has&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Uncle Shad! I told you to listen. And you needn&rsquo;t try to change the
      subject or to pretend I don&rsquo;t know what I am talking about. I do know. And
      as for pretending&mdash;well, there has been pretending enough. What do
      you mean&mdash;you and Uncle Zoeth&mdash;by sending me off to school and
      to Europe and declaring up and down that you didn&rsquo;t need me here at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t need you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; vowed Zoeth eagerly. &ldquo;We got along
      fust-rate without you. And we wanted you to go to school and to Europe.
      You see, it makes us feel proud to know our girl is gettin&rsquo; a fine
      education and seein&rsquo; the world. It ain&rsquo;t any more than she deserves, but
      it makes us feel awful pleased to know she&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for the store,&rdquo; broke in the Captain, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ve been
      pawin&rsquo; over them books and they&rsquo;ve kind of&mdash;kind of gone to your
      head. I don&rsquo;t wonder at it, this time of night! Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s all
      right. We may be a little mite behind in some of our bills, but&mdash;er&mdash;but.
      . . . DON&rsquo;T look at me like that, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! What do you do it for? Stop
      it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t stop it. I know all about Hamilton
      and Company&rsquo;s condition; perhaps I know it better than you do. This is the
      fifth night that I have been working over those books and I should know,
      at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The FIFTH night! Do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t tell me what I wanted to know; I had to
      see these books for myself and at night was the only time I could do it.
      But never mind that now,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk of that later. Other
      things come first. Uncle Shad and Uncle Zoeth, I know not only about the
      affairs of Hamilton and Company, but about my own as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth leaned forward and stared at her. He seemed to catch the
      significance of the remark, for he looked frightened, whereas Shadrach was
      only puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you know what, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo; faltered Zoeth. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; went on Mary, &ldquo;that I know where the money came from which has
      paid my school bills and for my clothes and my traveling things and all
      the rest. I know whose money has paid all my bills ever since I was seven
      years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach rose from his chair. He was as frightened as his partner now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talkin&rsquo; about, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You know!
      You don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;! You stop sayin&rsquo; such things! Why don&rsquo;t you stop
      her, Zoeth Hamilton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth was speechless. Mary went on as if there had been no interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I haven&rsquo;t a penny of my own and never did have
      and that you two have done it all. I know all about it&mdash;at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If these two men had been caught stealing they could not have looked more
      guilty. If, instead of being reminded that their niece had spent their
      money, they had been accused of misappropriating hers they could not have
      been more shaken or dumbfounded. Captain Shadrach stood before her, his
      face a fiery red and his mouth opening and shutting in vain attempts at
      articulation. Zoeth, his thin fingers extended in appeal, was the first to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk so! PLEASE don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I shall, Uncle Zoeth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mean to do more
      than talk from now on, but I must talk a little first. I&rsquo;m not going to
      try to tell you what it means to me to learn after all these years that I
      have been dependent on you for everything I have had, home and luxuries
      and education and opportunities. I realize now what sacrifices you must
      have made&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t, neither!&rdquo; roared the Captain, in frantic protest. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t, I
      tell you. Somebody&rsquo;s been tellin&rsquo; lies, ain&rsquo;t they, Zoeth? Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Uncle Shad! Someone HAS been telling me&mdash;er&mdash;fibs&mdash;I
      said that at the beginning; but they&rsquo;re not going to tell me any more. I
      know the truth, every bit of it, about Father&rsquo;s losing his money in stocks
      and&mdash;Uncle Shad, where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad was halfway to the door. He answered over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; home,&rdquo; he vowed, &ldquo;and when I get there I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to choke that
      dummed tattle-tale of an Isaiah Chase! I&rsquo;ll talk to YOU after I&rsquo;ve done
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary ran after him and caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back, Uncle Shad!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Come back, sit down, and don&rsquo;t be
      foolish. I don&rsquo;t want you to talk to me! I am going to talk to you, and
      I&rsquo;m not half through yet. Besides, it wasn&rsquo;t Isaiah who told me, it was
      Judge Baxter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Baxter! Why, the everlastin&rsquo; old&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! He couldn&rsquo;t help telling me, I made him do it. Be still, both of
      you, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did tell them, beginning with her meeting with Mr. Green at the Howe
      dinner, then of her stop at Ostable and the interview with Baxter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have found it all out, you see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to try to
      thank you&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t, if I did try. But I am going to take my turn
      at the work and the worry. To begin with, of course, you understand that I
      am through with Boston and school, through forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an excited and voluble protest, of course, but she paid no heed
      whatever to commands or entreaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am through,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I shall stay here and help you. I am only a
      girl and I can&rsquo;t do much, perhaps, but I truly believe I can do something.
      I am a sort of silent partner now; you understand that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked doubtful and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had my way,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d go straight back to that school and
      stay there long&rsquo;s we could rake or scrape enough together to keep you
      there. And I know Zoeth feels the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sartin do,&rdquo; agreed Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed softly. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t your way, you see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      have had it for ever so long and now I am going to have mine. Your new
      silent partner is going to begin to boss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since he entered the door of his store that night&mdash;or
      morning&mdash;Shadrach smiled. It wasn&rsquo;t a broad smile nor a very gay one,
      but it was a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;ya-as,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;I want to know, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! I am gettin&rsquo; 
      some along in years, but my memory ain&rsquo;t failed much. If I could remember
      any day or hour or minute since Zoeth and me h&rsquo;isted you into the old
      buggy to drive you from Ostable here&mdash;if I could remember a minute of
      that time when you HADN&rsquo;T bossed us, I&mdash;well, I&rsquo;d put it down in the
      log with a red ink circle around it. No, sir-ee! You&rsquo;ve been OUR skipper
      from the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Zoeth smiled now and Mary laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t objected; you haven&rsquo;t minded being&mdash;what shall I
      call it?&mdash;skipped&mdash;by me, have you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain grinned. &ldquo;Mind it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Umph! The only time when we
      really minded it was these last two years when we ain&rsquo;t had it. We minded
      missin&rsquo; it, that&rsquo;s what we minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t miss it any more. Now help me put these things back in
      the safe and we&rsquo;ll go home. Yes, home! Tomorrow morning&mdash;this
      morning, I mean&mdash;we&rsquo;ll talk and I&rsquo;ll tell you some of my plans. Oh,
      yes! I have plans and I am in hopes they may do great things for Hamilton
      and Company. But no more talk tonight. Remember, the skipper is back on
      board!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So to the house they went and to bed, the Captain and Mr. Hamilton under
      protest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Neither Mary nor the Captain nor Mr. Hamilton slept much of the few hours
      until daylight, and Captain Shadrach, who was devoured with curiosity
      concerning the plans, would have asked particulars before breakfast, but
      Mary would not listen to questions. It was not until breakfast was over
      and they were back in the store that she consented to discuss the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The safe was reopened and the books and papers spread out upon the desk.
      Mary took up one of the sheets of paper; it was covered with rows of
      figures in her handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it seems to me that the first thing is to find out
      exactly where we stand. When I say &lsquo;we,&rsquo;&rdquo; she added, with a nod of great
      importance, &ldquo;I mean &lsquo;we,&rsquo; because, as I told you last night, I am a silent
      partner in the business now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be so terrible much silence,&rdquo; observed Shadrach dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Another remark of that kind and I shall set you to sweeping out,
      Uncle Shad. Now, Uncle Zoeth, according to the books this is what we owe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read from the paper in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the total, Uncle Zoeth, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked. Zoeth groaned and
      admitted that he cal&rsquo;lated it was nigh enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But this,&rdquo; holding up another sheet of paper, &ldquo;is what is owed us,
      and it is almost as much as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Shadrach&rsquo;s turn to groan. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis if we could get a-hold of it,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;The heft of the gang on that list ain&rsquo;t got a cent and the bulk
      of the rest of &lsquo;em wouldn&rsquo;t have if they paid what they owed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some that can pay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Jeremiah Clifford, for instance.
      According to the books he owes us over a hundred and ten dollars and part
      of the account is three years old. Mr. Clifford owns property. He can&rsquo;t be
      a poor man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain sniffed. &ldquo;His wife owns the property,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every stick&rsquo;s
      in her name. Jerry Clifford&rsquo;s got enough, but he loves it too well to let
      go of it. Mean! Why, say! In the old days, when fishin&rsquo; schooners used to
      run from South Harniss here, Jerry he was owner and skipper of a little
      hooker and Solon Black went one v&rsquo;yage with him. There was another fo&rsquo;mast
      hand besides Jerry and Solon aboard and Solon swears that all the hearty
      provision Jerry put on board for a four-day trip was two sticks of smoked
      herrin&rsquo;. For two days, so Solon vows, they ate the herrin&rsquo; and the other
      two they chewed the sticks. That may be stretchin&rsquo; it a mite, but anyhow
      it goes to show that Jerry Clifford don&rsquo;t shed money same as a cat does
      its hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth put in a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he&rsquo;ll pay pretty soon,&rdquo; he observed plaintively. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
      sayin&rsquo; it for over a year, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Shadrach. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only a difference of one letter
      between &lsquo;sayin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;payin&rsquo;,&rsquo; but there ain&rsquo;t but two between &lsquo;trust&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;bust.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary spoke. &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall see Mr. Clifford myself. And
      I shall see some of these others, too. Now about our own bills&mdash;those
      we owe. I have a list of the principal creditors. Mr. Green&rsquo;s firm is one
      of them; we owe them most of all, it seems. I think I shall go and see Mr.
      Green myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land sakes, what for?&rdquo; demanded Shadrach. &ldquo;He knows how we&rsquo;re
      fixed, Zoeth wrote him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I want to talk with him, nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what for? You ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; beggin&rsquo; him to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going begging at all. When I talked with him at the Howes&rsquo; he,
      not knowing in the least who I was or that I was your niece, expressed
      sympathy for Hamilton and Company and wished there were some way of
      helping us out of our trouble&mdash;something he could do, you know. I&rsquo;m
      not sure there isn&rsquo;t something he can do. At any rate, I am going to see
      him. I shall start for Boston Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth ventured an observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be considerable surprised to see you, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;I think he will,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Surprised and a little
      embarrassed. But I imagine his embarrassment will make him all the more
      anxious to be of service to me, and that&rsquo;s what I want from him&mdash;service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the partners asked hundreds more questions concerning the plans.
      Mary&rsquo;s answers were still disappointingly vague. Before she could tell
      just what she meant to do, she said she must be sure, and she was not sure
      yet. A great deal would depend upon her Boston trip. They must be patient
      until she returned from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were patient&mdash;that is to say, Zoeth was really so and Captain
      Shadrach was as patient as it was his nature to be. Mary was absent nearly
      a week. When she returned she had much to tell. She had visited Mr. Green
      at his office on Commercial Street. His surprise and embarrassment were
      all that she had prophesied. He offered profuse apologies for his blunder
      at the Howes&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if I had known of your relationship to Captain Gould and Mr.
      Hamilton,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I should never&mdash;Really, I am&mdash;I assure you
      I hadn&rsquo;t the slightest idea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was floundering like a stranded fish. Mary helped him off the shoals by
      taking the remainder of his apologies for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I am very glad you told me, Mr.
      Green. It was high time I knew. Don&rsquo;t say another word about it, please. I
      have come to you to ask advice and, perhaps, help of a sort. May I have a
      little of your time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Green seized the opportunity thus offered. Indeed, she might have
      time, all the time she wanted. Anything in his power to do&mdash;and so
      on. Being a bachelor and something of an elderly beau who prided himself
      upon making a good impression with the sex, it had annoyed him greatly,
      the memory of his mistake. Also he had been distinctly taken with Mary and
      was anxious to reinstate himself in her opinion. So his willingness to
      atone was even eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it happens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not at all busy this afternoon. I can give
      you the rest of the day, if you wish. Now what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary explained that she had come to speak with him concerning her uncles&rsquo; 
      business affairs, his house being Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s largest creditor.
      She told of her investigations, of the condition in which she had found
      the accounts, and of her determination to remain at South Harniss and work
      for the upbuilding of the concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am not a business person like yourself, Mr. Green,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I am only a girl. But I worked in my uncles&rsquo; store and, in a way, managed
      it for two years or more before I came to Boston to school. Beside that I
      have talked during these last few days with some of South Harniss&rsquo;s most
      prominent people&mdash;permanent residents, not summer people. From what
      they and others tell me I am convinced that the sole reason why my uncles&rsquo; 
      business has fallen behind is because of a lack of keeping up to the times
      in the face of competition. Everyone likes Uncle Zoeth and Uncle Shadrach
      and wishes them well&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t help that, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made this assertion with such evident pride and with such absolute
      confidence that Mr. Green, although inclined to smile, felt it might be
      poor judgment to do so. So he agreed that there was no doubt of Shadrach&rsquo;s
      and Zoeth&rsquo;s universal popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Mary, &ldquo;they are dears, both of them, and they think
      everyone else is as honest as they are, which is a mistake, of course. So
      some people impose on them and don&rsquo;t pay their bills. I intend to stop
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She evidently expected her listener to make some comment, so he said, &ldquo;Oh,
      indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Mary. &ldquo;I intend to stop their trusting everyone under the
      sun and I shall try my hardest to collect from those they have already
      trusted. There is almost enough due to pay every bill we owe, and I
      believe two-thirds of that is collectible if one really goes after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will go after it, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I most certainly shall. You are smiling, Mr. Green. I suppose it sounds
      like a joke, a girl like myself making such statements about things men
      are supposed to understand and women not to understand at all. It isn&rsquo;t a
      joke in this case, because I think I understand my uncles business better
      than they do. I think I can collect what is owed us, pay what we owe, and
      make money there in South Harniss. But to do that I must have time and, by
      and by, credit, for we need goods. And that is what I came to talk to you
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had brought with her copies of the Hamilton and Company trial balance,
      also a list of the firm&rsquo;s debtors and creditors. These she put upon the
      desk before Mr. Green and ran a finger down the pages with explanatory
      remarks such as, &ldquo;This is good, I know,&rdquo; &ldquo;This can be collected but it may
      take a lawyer to get it,&rdquo; or, as in the case of &lsquo;Rastus Young&rsquo;s
      long-standing indebtedness, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t worth anything and shouldn&rsquo;t be
      counted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, in conclusion, &ldquo;we aren&rsquo;t in such a VERY bad state;
      it isn&rsquo;t hopeless, anyway. Now here are the accounts we owe. Yours is the
      largest. Here are the others. All these bills are going to be paid, just
      as I said, but they can&rsquo;t be paid at all unless I have time. I have been
      thinking, thinking very hard, Mr. Green&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Green nodded. &ldquo;I can see that,&rdquo; he put in, good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, this is what I want to ask you: Will you give us six months
      more to pay the whole of this bill in? I don&rsquo;t think we shall need so much
      time, but I want to be sure. And if at the end of two months we have paid
      half of it, will you give us credit for another small bill of goods for
      the summer season, so that we may be stocked and ready? The summer is our
      best season, you see,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Green nodded. Her businesslike manner he found amusing, although he by
      no means shared her confidence in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be very glad to extend the time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may remember I
      told you the other evening that so far as our house was concerned, we
      should probably be willing to sell your uncles indefinitely, for old
      times&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His visitor frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are not asking it for old times&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is the new times
      I am interested in. And please understand this isn&rsquo;t sentiment but
      business. If you do not believe what I ask to be a safe business risk,
      that one your firm would be justified in accepting from anybody, then you
      mustn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Green hesitated. &ldquo;Suppose I do not accept that risk,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall go and see some other creditors, the principal ones, and
      make them similar propositions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose they don&rsquo;t accept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they will, most of them. If they don&rsquo;t&mdash;well, then there is
      another way. My uncles own their house and store. They have been thinking
      of selling their property to pay their debts. I should hate to have them
      sell, and I don&rsquo;t believe it is necessary. I have been talking with Judge
      Baxter over at Ostable&mdash;I stopped there on my way to Boston&mdash;and
      he suggested that they might mortgage and raise money that way. It could
      be done, couldn&rsquo;t it? Mortgages are a kind of business I don&rsquo;t know
      anything about. They sound horrid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes they are. Miss Lathrop, if I were you I shouldn&rsquo;t sell or
      mortgage yet. I am inclined to believe, judging by this balance sheet and
      what you say, that you have a chance to pull Hamilton and Company out of
      the fire, and I&rsquo;m very sure you can do it if anyone can. Are you going to
      be in the city for a day or two? Good! Then will you let me consider this
      whole matter until&mdash;say&mdash;Thursday? By that time I shall have
      made up my mind and may have something to say which will be worth while.
      Can you come in Thursday afternoon at two? And will you? Very well. Oh,
      don&rsquo;t thank me! I haven&rsquo;t done anything yet. Perhaps I shall not be able
      to, but we shall hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary went straight to Mrs. Wyeth&rsquo;s home on Pinckney Street and once more
      occupied her pleasant room on the third floor. In spite of her
      determination not to care she could not help feeling a little pang as she
      walked by the Misses Cabot&rsquo;s school and remembered that she would never
      again enjoy the privileges and advantages of that exclusive institution.
      She wondered how the girls, her classmates, had felt and spoken when they
      heard the news that she had left them and returned to Cape Cod and
      storekeeping. Some would sneer and laugh&mdash;she knew that&mdash;and
      some might be a little sorry. But they would all forget her, of course.
      Doubtless, most of them had forgotten her already.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fact that all had not forgotten was proved that very evening when,
      as she and Mrs. Wyeth and Miss Pease were sitting talking together in the
      parlor, Maggie, the maid, answering the ring of the doorbell, ushered in
      Miss Barbara Howe. Barbara was, as usual, arrayed like the lilies of the
      field, but her fine petals were decidedly crumpled by the hug which she
      gave Mary as soon as she laid eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bad girl!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you were in town? And
      why didn&rsquo;t you answer my letter&mdash;the one I wrote you at South
      Harniss? I didn&rsquo;t hear a word and only tonight, after dinner, I had the
      inspiration of phoning Mrs. Wyeth and trying to learn from her where you
      were and what you meant by dropping all your friends. Maggie answered the
      phone and said you were here and I threw on my things&mdash;yes, &lsquo;threw&rsquo; 
      is the word; nothing else describes the process&mdash;and came straight
      over. How DO you do? And WHAT are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary said she was well and that she had been too busy to reply to Miss
      Howe&rsquo;s letter. But this did not satisfy. Barbara wanted to know why she
      had been busy and how, so Mary told of her determination to remain in
      South Harniss and become a business woman, Barbara was greatly excited and
      enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be perfectly splendid!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I only wish I were going
      to do it instead of having to stay at that straight-up-and-down school and
      listen to Prissy&rsquo;s dissertations on Emerson. She told the Freshman class
      the other day that she had had the honor of meeting Mr. Emerson when very
      young&mdash;when SHE was young, she meant; she always tells every Freshman
      class that, you know&mdash;and one of the Freshies spoke up and asked if
      she ever met him afterwards when he was older. They said her face was a
      picture; I wish I might have seen it. But do tell me more about that
      wonderful store of yours. I am sure it will be a darling, because anything
      you have anything to do with is sure to be. Are you going to have a
      tea-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;I think not. There&rsquo;s too
      much competition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you ought to have one. Not of the ordinary kind, you know, but
      the&mdash;the other kind, the unusual kind. Why, I have a cousin&mdash;a
      second&mdash;no, third cousin, a relative of Daddy&rsquo;s, she is&mdash;who
      hadn&rsquo;t much money and whose health wasn&rsquo;t good and the doctor sent her to
      live in the country. Live there all the time! Only fancy! Oh, I forgot you
      were going to do the same thing. Do forgive me! I&rsquo;m so sorry! WHAT a
      perfect gump I am! Oh, dear me! There I go again! And I know you abhor
      slang, Mrs. Wyeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me more about your cousin, Barbara,&rdquo; put in Mary, before the shocked
      Mrs. Wyeth could reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she went to the country and took an old house, the funniest old thing
      you ever saw. And she put up the quaintest little sign! And opened a
      tea-room and gift shop. I don&rsquo;t know why they call them &lsquo;gift shops.&rsquo; They
      certainly don&rsquo;t give away anything. Far, far from that, my dear! Daddy
      calls this one of Esther&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Robbers&rsquo; Roost&rsquo; because he says she
      charges forty cents for a gill of tea and two slices of toast cut in eight
      pieces. But I tell him he doesn&rsquo;t pay for the tea and toast alone&mdash;it
      is the atmosphere of the place. He says if he had to pay for all his
      atmosphere at that rate he would be asphyxiated in a few months. But he
      admires Esther very much. She makes heaps and heaps of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then her tea-room and gift shop is a success?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A success! Oh, my dear! It&rsquo;s a scream of a success! Almost any day in
      summer there are at least a dozen motor cars outside the door. Everybody
      goes there; it&rsquo;s the proper thing to do. I know all this because it isn&rsquo;t
      very far from our summer home in Clayton&mdash;in the mountains, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she made a success,&rdquo; mused Mary. &ldquo;Were there other tea-rooms about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dozens! But they&rsquo;re not original; hers is. They haven&rsquo;t the&mdash;the
      something&mdash;you know what I mean, Esther has the style, the knack, the&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t say it, but you know. And you would have it, too; I&rsquo;m perfectly sure
      you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was evidently much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I might meet your cousin,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you can. She is here in Boston now, buying for the summer. I&rsquo;ll
      phone her and we three will lunch together tomorrow. Don&rsquo;t say you won&rsquo;t;
      you&rsquo;ve just got to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mary, rather reluctantly, consented to make one of the luncheon party.
      Afterward she was glad that she did, for Miss Esther Hemingway&mdash;this
      was the cousin&rsquo;s name&mdash;was an interesting person. She told Mary all
      about her tea-room and gift shop, how she started in business, the
      mistakes she made at first, and the lessons she had learned from
      experience. Because Barbara had asked her to do so she brought with her
      photographs of the establishment, its attractive and quaint exterior and
      its equally delightful interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole secret,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is in keeping everything in good taste and
      simple. Choose the right location, fit up your rooms in taste and
      cheerfully, serve the best you can find, and sell the unusual and the
      attractive things that other people do not have, or at least are not
      likely to have. Then charge adequate prices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adequate being spelled A double D,&rdquo; observed Barbara significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary parted from Miss Hemingway with a new idea in her head, an idea that
      sometime or other she meant to put into practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday afternoon she called upon Mr. Green. That gentleman, having
      had his opportunity to think, was ready with a proposition. Briefly it was
      this: He had personally seen the principal creditors of Hamilton and
      Company&mdash;they were all Boston business houses&mdash;and he and they
      had agreed to make the following offer: Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s credit upon
      debts already owed was to be extended six months. Mary was to go home,
      endeavor to collect what money she could, and with it buy for cash
      whatever goods were needed for the summer season. If that season was a
      success and the business promised well for the future, then arrangements
      could be made for future buying and for paying the old debt a little at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Green, &ldquo;this postpones the mortgaging or
      selling for a time at least, and you always have it to fall back on if you
      can&rsquo;t make your new undertaking pay. I believe you can. I advise you to
      accept. Your other creditors feel the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not add, as he might have done, that the opinion of those other
      creditors had been influenced almost entirely by his own and that in one
      or two instances he had been obliged practically to underwrite the payment
      of Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s indebtedness before gaining consent. He had
      talked with Mr. Howe, who in turn had called his daughter into
      consultation, and Barbara&rsquo;s enthusiastic praise of her friend had
      strengthened the favorable impression which the girl had already made upon
      both gentlemen. &ldquo;Do you know, I believe she may win out,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Howe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am inclined to think she will,&rdquo; concurred Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she will!&rdquo; declared Barbara hotly. &ldquo;No one who ever knew her
      would be silly enough to think she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hence Mr. Green&rsquo;s underwriting expedition and the proposition to Mary as
      the representative of Hamilton and Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary accepted, of course. She was very grateful and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you, Mr. Green. I can&rsquo;t promise anything, but
      if trying hard will win, I can promise that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, that&rsquo;s all right. I know you&rsquo;ll try, and I think you&rsquo;ll
      succeed. Now, why don&rsquo;t you go up and pick out some of those summer goods?
      You don&rsquo;t need them yet, and you needn&rsquo;t pay for them yet, but now is the
      time to select. Give my regards to your uncles when you see them and tell
      them I wish them luck. I may be motoring down the Cape this summer and if
      I do I shall drop in on you and them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had news to tell when she reached South Harniss. It was listened to
      with attention, if not entirely in silence. Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s
      ejaculations of &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire, how
      you talk!&rdquo; served as punctuation marks during the narration. When she had
      finished her story, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Uncle Zoeth and Uncle Shad&mdash;now that you&rsquo;ve heard the whole
      of it, and know what my plan is, what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both answers were characteristic. Zoeth drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Almighty sent you to us, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he vowed. &ldquo;There was a time a
      little spell ago when I begun to think He&rsquo;d pretty nigh deserted us. I was
      almost discouraged and it shook my trust&mdash;it shook my trust. But now
      I can see He was just tryin&rsquo; us out and in His good time He sent you to
      haul us off the shoals. He&rsquo;ll do it, too; I know it and I&rsquo;ll thank Him
      tonight on my knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head. &ldquo;By fire!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I always said
      you was a wonder. You&rsquo;ve given us a chance to get clear of the breakers,
      anyhow, and that&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; we&rsquo;d never have done ourselves. Now, if you
      can collect that money from Jeremiah Clifford I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I swan
      to man I&rsquo;ll believe anything&rsquo;s possible, even Jonah&rsquo;s swallowin&rsquo; the
      whale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Shadrach!&rdquo; protested his partner. &ldquo;If you wouldn&rsquo;t be so irreverent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll behave. But it&rsquo;s just as I say: if Mary-&rsquo;Gusta can get
      Jerry Clifford to pay up I&rsquo;ll swallow Jonah and the whale, too. &lsquo;Twas
      Moses that hit the rock and the water gushed out, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it? Um&mdash;hm!
      Well, that was somethin&rsquo; of a miracle, but strikin&rsquo; Jerry Clifford for ten
      cents and gettin&rsquo; it would be a bigger one. Why, that feller&rsquo;s got fists
      like&mdash;like one of those sensitive plants my mother used to have in
      the settin&rsquo;-room window when I was a boy. You touch a leaf of one of those
      plants and &lsquo;twould shrivel up tight. Jerry&rsquo;s fists are that way&mdash;touch
      one of &lsquo;em with a nickel and &lsquo;twill shut up, but not until the nickel&rsquo;s
      inside. No, sir! Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew all this, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; suggested Mary, &ldquo;why in the world did
      you sell Mr. Clifford at all? If he wouldn&rsquo;t pay, why sell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hamilton answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always did pay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see, he had to have groceries and
      clothes and such and whenever he needed more and thought he owed us so
      much we wouldn&rsquo;t put more on the bill he&rsquo;d pay a little on account. That
      way we managed to keep up with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly up with him,&rdquo; commented the Captain. &ldquo;We was always a couple
      of laps astern, but we could keep him in sight. Now the new stores have
      come and he can get trusted there he don&rsquo;t buy from us&mdash;or pay,
      either. What&rsquo;s the use? That&rsquo;s what he thinks, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary considered. &ldquo;The mean old sinner!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I should judge, Uncle
      Shad, that what you told me once, when I was a little girl, about the Free
      Masons might apply to Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s pocketbook. You said that once in
      Masonry a man never got out. A dollar in Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s pocketbook never
      gets out, either, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach chuckled. &ldquo;You bet it don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got a life
      sentence. And, so fur as that goes, they generally open a Mason lodge
      meetin&rsquo; with prayer, but &lsquo;twould take more&rsquo;n that to open Jerry&rsquo;s
      pocketbook, I&rsquo;LL bet you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, nevertheless,&rdquo; declared Mary, laughing, &ldquo;I mean to make him pay our
      bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did make the tight-fisted one pay up eventually, but months were to
      elapse before that desirable consummation was reached. In the meantime she
      set herself to collecting other amounts owed Hamilton and Company and to
      building up the trade at the store. The collecting was not so difficult as
      she had expected. The Captain and Mr. Hamilton had been reluctant to ask
      their friends and neighbors to be prompt in their payments, and largely
      through carelessness accounts had been permitted to drop behind. Mary
      personally saw the debtors and in most cases, by offering slight discounts
      or by accepting installments, she was able to obtain at least the greater
      part of the money due. In some cases she could obtain nothing and expected
      nothing, but these cases, among them that of &lsquo;Rastus Young, were rather to
      be considered in the light of good riddance even at the price. As Shadrach
      said, it was worth a few dollars not to have to listen to &lsquo;Rastus or Mrs.
      &lsquo;Rastus cry over their troubles whenever they wanted to hold up the firm
      for more plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last time &lsquo;Rastus was in to buy anything,&rdquo; declared the Captain, &ldquo;he shed
      so blamed many tears into my rubber boots that I got wet feet and sent the
      boots to the cobbler&rsquo;s to have &lsquo;em plugged. I cal&rsquo;lated they leaked; I
      didn&rsquo;t realize &lsquo;twas Rat workin&rsquo; me out of four dollars worth of groceries
      by water power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The collections, then, those from Mr. Young and his ilk excepted, were
      satisfactory. Mary was enabled to buy and pay for a modest assortment of
      summer supplies, those she had selected while in Boston. The store she had
      thoroughly cleaned and renovated. The windows were kept filled with
      attractive displays of goods, and the prices of these goods, as set forth
      upon tickets, were attractive also. Business began to pick up, not a great
      deal at first, but a little, and as May brought the first of the
      early-bird summer cottagers to South Harniss, the silent partner of
      Hamilton and Company awaited the coming of what should be the firm&rsquo;s
      busiest season with hope and some confidence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      During all this time she had heard from Crawford at least once a week. He
      would have written oftener than that, had she permitted it. And in spite
      of her determination so bravely expressed in their interview over the
      telephone, she had written him more than the one letter she had promised.
      In that letter&mdash;her first&mdash;she told him the exact situation
      there at home; of her discovery that her uncles were in trouble, that the
      small, but to them precious, business they had conducted so long was in
      danger, and of her determination to give up school and remain at South
      Harniss where, she knew, she was needed. Then she went on to tell of her
      still greater discovery, that instead of being a young woman of
      independent means, she was and always had been dependent upon the bounty
      of her uncles.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can imagine how I felt when I learned this [she wrote], when I thought
      of all the kindness I had accepted at their hands, accepted it almost as
      if it was my right, thinking as I did that my own money paid. And now to
      learn that all the time I had nothing and they had given of their own when
      they had so little, and given it so cheerfully, so gladly. And, Crawford,
      when I told them what I had done, they would not accept thanks, they would
      not let me even speak of the great debt I owed them. So far from that they
      acted as if they were the ones who owed and as if I had caught them in
      some disgraceful act. Why, if they could, they would have sent me back to
      Boston and to school, while they remained here to work and worry until the
      bankruptcy they expected came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you wonder that I feel my first and whole duty is to them and that
      nothing, NOTHING must be permitted to interfere with it? I am going to
      stay here and try to help. Perhaps I shall succeed, and perhaps, which is
      just as probable, I may fail; but at any rate while my uncles live and
      need me I shall not leave them. They gave all they had to me when there
      was no real reason why they should give anything. The very least I can do
      is to be with them and work for them now when they are growing old.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure you must understand this and that, therefore, you will forget&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. &ldquo;Forget&rdquo; was a hard word to write. Fortunately she had written
      it at the top of a page, so she tore up that sheet and began the line
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure you will understand and that you will see my duty as I see it
      myself. It seems to me clear. Everyone has duties, I suppose, but you and
      I have ours very plainly shown us, I think. Yours is to your father and
      mine to my uncles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing that letter to an end was a difficult task. There were things
      which must be said and they were so very hard to say. At last, after many
      attempts:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not referred [she wrote] to what you said to me when we last met.
      It seems almost useless to refer to it, doesn&rsquo;t it? You see how I am
      placed here, and I have written you what I mean to do. And please
      understand I am doing it gladly, I am happy in having the opportunity to
      do it; but it does mean that for years my life and interest must be here
      with them. Even if I were sure of my own feelings&mdash;and perhaps I am
      not really sure&mdash;I certainly should not think of asking one I cared
      for to wait so long. You have your future to think of, Crawford, and you
      must think of it. And there is your father. Of course, I don&rsquo;t know, but I
      somehow feel certain that he will not wish you to marry me. Don&rsquo;t you
      think it better for us both to end it now? It seems so hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which, she flattered herself, was brave and sensible and right. And,
      having reached this commendable conclusion and sealed and posted the
      letter, she came back to the house, went upstairs to her room, and,
      throwing herself upon the bed, cried bitterly for many minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in a way, her tears were wasted. It takes two to make a bargain and
      although she might notify Crawford Smith that his case was hopeless, it by
      no means followed that that young gentleman would accept the notification
      as final. His reply to her letter was prompt and convincing. All the
      references to ending it were calmly brushed aside. There could be but two
      endings, one being their marriage&mdash;this, of course, the logical and
      proper ending&mdash;and the other Mary&rsquo;s notifying him that she did not
      love him. Anything else was nonsense and not worth consideration. Wait! He
      would wait fifty years if necessary, provided she would wait for him. He
      was about to take up his studies again, but now he would feel that he was
      working for her. His father, he was sorry to say, was not at all well. He
      was very nervous, weak and irritable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came home [he wrote] fully determined to tell him of you and my
      determination to marry you&mdash;always provided you will have me, you
      know&mdash;on the very night of my arrival. But when I saw how poor old
      Dad was feeling and after the doctor told me how very necessary it was
      that his nervous system be allowed a complete rest, I decided I must wait.
      So I shall wait; perhaps I shall not tell him for months; but just as soon
      as he is able to hear, I shall speak, and I am sure he will say, &ldquo;Good
      luck and God bless you.&rdquo; But if he doesn&rsquo;t, it will make not the slightest
      difference. If you will have me, Mary dear, nothing on this earth is going
      to stop my having you. That&rsquo;s as settled and solid a fact as the Rocky
      Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pleaded for a letter at least once a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      You needn&rsquo;t put a word of love in it [he wrote]. I know how conscientious
      you are, and I know perfectly well that until your mind is made up you
      won&rsquo;t feel it right to encourage me in the least. But do please write, if
      only to tell me how you are getting on with Hamilton and Company. I only
      wish I were there to help you pull those fine old uncles of yours out of
      the hot water. I know you&rsquo;ll do it, though. And meanwhile I shall be
      digging away out here and thinking of you. Please write OFTEN.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mary, after considerable thought and indecision, did write, although
      Crawford&rsquo;s suggestion that her letters have no word of love in them was
      scrupulously followed. And so, while the summer came and went, the letters
      crossed and the news of the slow but certain building up of the business
      of Hamilton and Company was exchanged for that of Edwin Smith&rsquo;s steady
      regaining of health and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s business was reviving. Even the skeptics could
      see the signs. The revival began before the summer residents arrived in
      South Harniss, but after the latter began to come and the cottages to
      open, it was on in earnest. John Keith helped to give it its first big
      start. Mrs. Wyeth wrote him of Mary&rsquo;s leaving her school work to go to the
      rescue of Shadrach and Zoeth, and the girl&rsquo;s pluck and uncomplaining
      acceptance of the task she considered set for her made Keith&rsquo;s eyes
      twinkle with admiration as he read the letter. The family came early to
      South Harniss and this year he came with them. One of his first acts after
      arrival was to stroll down to the village and enter Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s
      store. Mary and the partners were there, of course. He shook hands with
      them cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; he said, addressing Shadrach, &ldquo;how is the new hand taking
      hold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach grinned. &ldquo;Hand?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve got any new
      hand, Mr. Keith. Ain&rsquo;t, have we, Zoeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth did not recognize the joke. &ldquo;He means Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I cal&rsquo;late,
      Shadrach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; splendid, Mr. Keith. I don&rsquo;t know how we
      ever got along without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; put in his partner promptly; &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s how. But, Mr.
      Keith, you hadn&rsquo;t ought to call Mary-&rsquo;Gusta a &lsquo;hand.&rsquo; Zoeth and me are the
      hands aboard this craft. She&rsquo;s skipper, and engineer, and purser, and&mdash;yes,
      and pilot, too. And don&rsquo;t she make us tumble up lively when she whistles!
      Whew! Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the boss, then, is she?&rdquo; observed Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boss! I guess SO! She&rsquo;s got US trained! Why, I&rsquo;ve got so that I jump out
      of bed nights and run round the room in my sleep thinkin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s just
      hollered to me there&rsquo;s a customer waitin&rsquo;. Oh, she&rsquo;s a hard driver,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta is. Never had a fust mate aboard drove harder&rsquo;n she does. And
      it&rsquo;s havin&rsquo; its effect on us, too. Look at Zoeth! He&rsquo;s agin&rsquo; fast; he&rsquo;s a
      year older&rsquo;n he was twelve months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith laughed, Mary smiled, and Mr. Hamilton, judging by the behavior of
      the company that there was a joke somewhere on the premises, smiled too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind Uncle Shad, Mr. Keith,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;He talks a great
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talkin&rsquo;s all the exercise my face gets nowadays,&rdquo; declared the Captain
      instantly. &ldquo;She keeps me so busy I don&rsquo;t get time to eat. What do you
      think of the store, Mr. Keith? Some improvement, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith, who had already noticed the trim appearance of the store and the
      neat and attractive way in which the goods were displayed, expressed his
      hearty approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is business?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiptop!&rdquo; declared Shadrach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s improvin&rsquo; consider&rsquo;ble,&rdquo; said Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a little better, but it must be far better before I am satisfied,&rdquo;
       said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the cottage trade?&rdquo; asked Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not so very good. There aren&rsquo;t many cottagers here yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Keith reached home he called his wife into consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gertrude,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;where do we buy our household supplies, groceries
      and the like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Boston, most of them. The others&mdash;those I am obliged to buy here
      in South Harniss&mdash;at that new store, Baker&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to buy them all of Hamilton and Company hereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;THAT old-fogy place! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the partners, Captain Gould and the other old chap, are having a
      hard struggle to keep going and I want to help them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Keith tossed her head. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;I know why you are so
      interested. It is because of that upstart girl you think is so wonderful,
      the one who has been boarding with Clara Wyeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, that&rsquo;s just it. She has given up her studies and her
      opportunities there in Boston and has come down here to help her uncles.
      Clara writes me that she was popular there in the school, that the best
      people were her friends, and you know of her summer in Europe with Letitia
      Pease. Letitia isn&rsquo;t easy to please and she is enthusiastic about Mary
      Lathrop. No ordinary girl could give up all that sort of thing and come
      back to the village where everyone knows her and go to keeping store
      again, and do it so cheerfully and sensibly and without a word of
      complaint. She deserves all the help and support we and our friends can
      give her. I mean to see that she has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Keith looked disgusted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly infatuated with that girl,
      John Keith,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is ridiculous. If I were like some women I
      should be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were like some men you might be. Now, Gertrude, you&rsquo;ll buy in future
      from Hamilton and Company, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. When your chin sets that way I know you&rsquo;re going to be
      stubborn and I may as well give in first as last. I&rsquo;ll patronize your
      precious Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, but I WON&rsquo;T associate with her. You needn&rsquo;t ask
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might wait until she asks it first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! tut! Really, John, you disgust me. I wonder you don&rsquo;t order Sam to
      marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what Clara writes he might not have needed any orders if he had
      received the least encouragement from her. Sam might do worse; I imagine
      he probably will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, because John Keith&rsquo;s chin was set, the Keith custom shifted to
      Hamilton and Company. And because the Keiths were wealthy and influential,
      and because the head of the family saw that that influence was brought to
      bear upon his neighbors and acquaintances, their custom followed. Hamilton
      and Company put a delivery wagon&mdash;a secondhand one&mdash;out on the
      road, and hired a distinctly secondhand boy to drive it. And Mary and
      Shadrach and Zoeth and, in the evenings, the boy as well, were kept busy
      waiting on customers. The books showed, since the silent partner took
      hold, a real and tangible profit, and the collection and payment of old
      debts went steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The partners, Shadrach and Zoeth, were no longer silent and glum. The
      Captain whistled and sang and was in high spirits most of the time. At
      home he was his old self, chaffing Isaiah about the housekeeping, taking a
      mischievous delight in shocking his friend and partner by irreverent
      remarks concerning Jonah or some other Old Testament personage, and
      occasionally, although not often, throwing out a sly hint to Mary about
      the frequency of letters from the West. Mary had told her uncles of
      Crawford&rsquo;s leaving Boston and returning to Nevada because of his father&rsquo;s
      ill health. The only item of importance she had omitted to tell was that
      of the proposal of marriage. She could not speak of that even to them.
      They would ask what her answer was to be, and if she loved Crawford. How
      could she answer that&mdash;truthfully&mdash;without causing them to feel
      that they were blocking her way to happiness? They felt that quite keenly
      enough, as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Captain Shad declared the illness of the South Harniss postmaster&mdash;confined
      to his bed with sciatica&mdash;to be due to his having &ldquo;stooped to pick up
      one of them eighty-two page Wild West letters of yours, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, and
      &lsquo;twas so heavy he sprained his back liftin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; Mary only laughed and
      ventured the opinion that the postmaster&rsquo;s sprained back, if he had one,
      was more likely due to a twist received in trying to read both sides of a
      postcard at once. Which explanation, being of the Captain&rsquo;s own brand of
      humor, pleased the latter immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s what &lsquo;twas.
      Seth [the postmaster] is pure rubber so far as other folks&rsquo; mail is
      concerned; maybe he stretched the rubber too far this time and it
      snapped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth did not joke much&mdash;joking was not in his line&mdash;but he
      showed his relief at the improvement in the firm&rsquo;s affairs in quieter but
      as unmistakable ways. When Mary was at the desk in the evenings after the
      store had closed, busy with the books, he would come and sit beside her,
      saying little but occasionally laying his hand gently on her shoulder or
      patting her arm and regarding her with a look so brimful of love and
      gratitude that it made her feel almost guilty and entirely unworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Uncle Zoeth,&rdquo; she protested, on one such occasion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at
      me like that. I&mdash;I&mdash;Really, you make me feel ashamed. I haven&rsquo;t
      done anything. I am not doing half enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; too much, I&rsquo;m afraid, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; 
      up everything a girl like you had ought to have and that your Uncle
      Shadrach and I had meant you should have. You&rsquo;re givin&rsquo; it up just for us
      and it ain&rsquo;t right. We ain&rsquo;t worthy of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Uncle Zoeth! Please! When I think what you have given up for
      me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. You came to your Uncle Shadrach and to me
      just when we needed somethin&rsquo; to keep our lives sweet. Mine especial was
      bitter and there was danger &lsquo;twould always be so. And then we brought you
      over from Ostable in the old buggy and&mdash;and the Almighty&rsquo;s sunshine
      came with you. You was His angel. Yes, sir! His angel, that&rsquo;s what you
      was, only we didn&rsquo;t know it then. I was pretty sore and bitter in those
      days, thought I never could forget. And yet&mdash;and yet, now I really am
      forgettin&rsquo;&mdash;or, if I don&rsquo;t forget, I&rsquo;m more reconciled. And you&rsquo;ve
      done it for me, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was puzzled. &ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Do you mean the business
      troubles, Uncle Zoeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth seemed to waken from a sort of dream. &ldquo;Business troubles?&rdquo; he
      repeated. &ldquo;No, no; long, long afore that these troubles were, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
      Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about &lsquo;em. I can&rsquo;t talk about &lsquo;em even now&mdash;and I
      mustn&rsquo;t think. There are some troubles that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo; He caught
      his breath and his tone changed. &ldquo;I called you an angel just now, dearie,&rdquo;
       he went on. &ldquo;Well, you was and you are. There are angels in this world&mdash;but
      there&rsquo;s devils, too&mdash;there&rsquo;s devils, too. There; the Lord forgive me!
      What am I talkin&rsquo; about? We&rsquo;ll forget what&rsquo;s gone and be thankful for
      what&rsquo;s here. Give your old uncle a kiss, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was happy in Mary&rsquo;s society and happy in the steady improvement of the
      business, but the girl and Captain Shadrach were a little worried
      concerning his general health. For years he had not been a very strong or
      active man, but now he looked paler and more frail than ever. He walked to
      and from the store and house several times a day, but he retired almost as
      soon as he entered the house at night and his appetite was not good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His nerves ain&rsquo;t back where they&rsquo;d ought to be,&rdquo; declared Shadrach. &ldquo;He
      was awful shook up when it looked as if Hamilton and Company was goin&rsquo; to
      founder. He didn&rsquo;t keep blowin&rsquo; off steam about it the way I did&mdash;my
      safety-valve&rsquo;s always open&mdash;but he kept it all inside his biler and
      it&rsquo;s put his engine out of gear. He&rsquo;ll get along all right so long&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s
      smooth sailin&rsquo;, but what I&rsquo;m afraid of is a rock showin&rsquo; up in the channel
      unexpected. The doctor told me that Zoeth mustn&rsquo;t worry any more and he
      mustn&rsquo;t work too hard. More&rsquo;n all, he mustn&rsquo;t have any scares or shocks or
      anything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to see that he doesn&rsquo;t have any,&rdquo; said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin sure we must, but you can&rsquo;t always see those things in time to
      head &lsquo;em off. Now take my own case. I had a shock this mornin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Rastus
      Young paid me a dollar on account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT? &lsquo;Rastus Young PAID you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he paid it, exactly. He borrowed the dollar of one
      of those summer fellers over at Cahoon&rsquo;s boardin&rsquo; house and he was tellin&rsquo; 
      Ab Bacheldor about it at the corner by the post-office. Ab, naturally,
      didn&rsquo;t believe any sane man would lend Rastus anything, so he wanted
      proof. &lsquo;Rastus hauled the dollar out of his pocket to show, and I who
      happened to be standin&rsquo; behind &lsquo;em without their knowin&rsquo; it reached out
      and grabbed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? Why, Uncle Shad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I told &lsquo;Rastus I&rsquo;d credit his account with it, but I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I
      hadn&rsquo;t ought to give it back to the summer feller. Anyhow, gettin&rsquo; it was
      a shock, same as I said at the beginnin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Rastus says he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sue
      me. I told him I&rsquo;d have sued HIM long ago if I&rsquo;d supposed he could STEAL a
      dollar, let alone borrow one.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late in August when Mary received the letter from Crawford in which
      he told of his determination to wait no longer but to tell his father of
      his love for her. Edwin Smith was much better. By way of proof, his son
      inclosed a photograph which he had taken of his father sitting beneath a
      tree on the lawn of their home. The picture showed Mr. Smith without his
      beard, which had been shaved off during his illness. Either this or the
      illness itself had changed him a great deal. He looked thinner and, which
      was odd under the circumstances, younger. Mary, looking at this
      photograph, felt more than ever the impossible conviction that somewhere
      or other at some time in her life she must have met Mr. Edwin Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in my next letter [wrote Crawford], I shall have news to tell. And I
      am sure it will be good news. &ldquo;Ask your father first,&rdquo; you said. Of course
      you remember that, and I have remembered it every moment since. Now I am
      going to ask him. After that you will give me your answer, won&rsquo;t you? And
      it can&rsquo;t be anything but yes, because I won&rsquo;t let it be.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mary&rsquo;s feelings were when she received this letter, whether or not
      she slept as soundly that night and other nights immediately following,
      whether or not the sight of Isaiah returning from the post-office at mail
      times caused her breath to come a little quicker and her nerves to thrill&mdash;these
      are questions the answers to which must be guessed. Suffice it to say that
      she manifested no marked symptoms of impatience and anxiety during that
      week and when at last Isaiah handed her another letter postmarked Carson
      City the trembling of the hand which received it was so slight as to be
      unnoticed by Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put aside the letter until that night when she was alone in her room.
      Then she opened it and read what Crawford had written. His father had not
      only refused consent to his son&rsquo;s contemplated marriage but had manifested
      such extraordinary agitation and such savage and unreasonable obstinacy
      that Crawford was almost inclined to believe his parent&rsquo;s recent illness
      had affected his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the only explanation I can think of [he wrote]. It seems as if he
      must be insane. And yet he seemed rational enough at the beginning of our
      first interview and during most of the second. Even when I had broken the
      news that there was a girl in whom I felt an especial interest he did not
      show any sign of the outbreak that came afterward. It wasn&rsquo;t until I began
      to tell how I first met you there at South Harniss, who you were, and
      about Captain Gould and Mr. Hamilton, that I noticed he was acting
      queerly. I was head over heels in my story, trying to make plain how
      desperate my case was and doing my best to make him appreciate how
      tremendously lucky his son was to have even a glimmer of a chance to get a
      girl like you for a wife, when I heard him make an odd noise in his
      throat. I looked up&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know where I had been looking before&mdash;certainly
      not at him&mdash;and there he was, leaning back in his chair, his face as
      white as his collar, and waving a hand at me. I thought he was choking, or
      was desperately ill or something, and I sprang toward him, but he waved me
      back. &ldquo;Stop! Wait!&rdquo; he said, or stammered, or choked; it was more like a
      croak than a human voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come here! Let me be! What are you trying
      to tell me? Who&mdash;who is this girl?&rdquo; I asked him what was the matter&mdash;his
      manner and his look frightened me&mdash;but he wouldn&rsquo;t answer, kept
      ordering me to tell him again who you were. So I did tell him that you
      were the daughter of the Reverend Charles Lathrop and Augusta Lathrop, and
      of your mother&rsquo;s second marriage to Captain Marcellus Hall. &ldquo;But he died
      when she was seven years old,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;and since that time she has
      been living with her guardians, the two fine old fellows who adopted her,
      Captain Shadrach Gould and Zoeth Hamilton. They live at South Harniss on
      Cape Cod.&rdquo; I had gotten no further than this when he interrupted me. &ldquo;She&mdash;she
      has been living with Zoeth Hamilton?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;With Zoeth Hamilton! Oh,
      my God! Did&mdash;did Zoeth Hamilton send you to me?&rdquo; Yes, that is exactly
      what he said: &ldquo;Did Zoeth Hamilton send you to me?&rdquo; I stared at him. &ldquo;Why,
      no, Dad,&rdquo; I said, as soon as I could say anything. &ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t. I
      have met Mr. Hamilton but once in my life. What IS the matter? Sit down
      again. Don&rsquo;t you think I had better call the doctor?&rdquo; I thought surely his
      brain was going. But no, he wouldn&rsquo;t answer or listen. Instead he looked
      at me with the wildest, craziest expression and said: &ldquo;Did Zoeth Hamilton
      tell you?&rdquo; &ldquo;He told me nothing, Dad,&rdquo; I said, as gently as I could. &ldquo;Of
      course he didn&rsquo;t. I am almost a stranger to him. Besides, what in the
      world was there to tell? I came to you because I had something to tell. I
      mean to marry Mary Lathrop, if she will have me&mdash;&rdquo; I got no further
      than that. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he fairly screamed. &ldquo;No! No! No! Oh, my God, no!&rdquo; And
      then the doctor came running in, we got Dad to bed, and it was all over
      for that day, except that I naturally was tremendously upset and
      conscience-stricken. I could see that the doctor thought I was to blame,
      that I had confessed something or other&mdash;something criminal, I
      imagine he surmised&mdash;to Dad and that it had knocked the poor old chap
      over. And I couldn&rsquo;t explain, because what I had told him was not for
      outsiders to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, after a terribly anxious night and a worrisome forenoon the doctor
      told me that father was himself again and wanted to see me at once. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      said all I can against it,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sort of
      rumpus you two had yesterday, but it came dangerously near being the
      finish for him. And it must not be repeated; I&rsquo;m making that as emphatic
      as I can.&rdquo; I assured him that so far as I was concerned there would not be
      a scene, and then went in to Dad&rsquo;s room. He looked white enough and sick
      enough but he was rational and his mind was keen and clear. He got me to
      tell the whole story about you all over again and he asked a lot of
      questions; in fact, he cross-examined me pretty thoroughly. When I had
      finished his tone was calm, but I noticed that his hand was shaking and he
      seemed to be holding himself in. &ldquo;And so you think you want to marry this
      down-east country girl, do you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; said I. He
      laughed, a forced laugh&mdash;didn&rsquo;t sound like his at all&mdash;and he
      said: &ldquo;Well, my boy, you&rsquo;ll get over it. It&rsquo;s a whole lot better to get
      over it now than to do so by and by when it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s a good thing
      I called you home when I did. You stay here and keep on with your studies
      and I&rsquo;ll keep on getting into shape again. By next summer, when we go on
      our fishing trip, you&rsquo;ll have forgotten all about your Down-Easter.&rdquo; Well,
      THAT was a staggerer, coming from him. It didn&rsquo;t sound like him at all,
      and again I had that feeling that his mind was going. You see, Mary, I
      never asked Dad for anything I didn&rsquo;t get&mdash;never. Now, I wasn&rsquo;t
      asking, I was just telling him what I had made up my mind to have, and he
      treated me this way. I answered him calmly and quietly, telling him I was
      serious and what you meant to me. He wouldn&rsquo;t listen at first; then when
      he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t agree. Pleaded with me&mdash;he was lonesome, I was
      his only son, he needed me, he couldn&rsquo;t share me with anyone else, and so
      on. There is no use going into all the details. We didn&rsquo;t get any nearer
      an agreement, we did get nearer and nearer to bad temper on my part and
      shouts and hysterics on his. So I left him, Mary. That was last night. I
      knew Dad was inclined to be stubborn, and I knew he had strong prejudices,
      but I never imagined he could behave like this to me. And I am sure he
      would not if he were himself. So I shall say no more to him on the subject
      for a day or two. Then, when he is better, as I am hoping he may be soon,
      he and I will have another talk. But understand, Mary dear, my mind was
      made up before I spoke to him at all. What he says or what he does will
      make no difference, so far as you and I are concerned. I know you are a
      believer in duty; well, so am I. I would stick by Dad through thick and
      thin. If I knew he was right in asking me to do or not to do a thing, even
      if I knew he had been wrong in asking other things, I would stick by him
      and try to do as he asked. But not this. I love Dad, God knows I do, but I
      love you, Mary, and as I have vowed to myself every day since I last saw
      you, I am going to marry you if you will only have me. As for Dad&mdash;well,
      we&rsquo;ll hope within a day or two I may have better news to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary read and reread the long letter. Then she leaned back in her chair
      and with the letter in her lap sat there&mdash;thinking. She had been
      right in her forebodings; it was as she had expected, had foreseen: Edwin
      Smith, man of affairs, wealthy, arbitrary, eccentric, accustomed to having
      his own way and his prejudices, however absurd, respected&mdash;a man with
      an only son for whom, doubtless, plans definite and ambitious had been
      made, could not be expected calmly to permit the upsetting of those plans
      by his boy&rsquo;s marriage to a poor &ldquo;Down-Easter.&rdquo; So much she had foreseen
      from the first, and she had never shared Crawford&rsquo;s absolute confidence in
      his parent&rsquo;s acquiescence. She had been prepared, therefore, to read that
      Mr. Smith had refused his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to be prepared for a probability and to face a certainty are quite
      different. It was the certainty she was facing now. Unless Mr. Smith
      changed his mind, and the chances were ten to one against that, he and his
      son would quarrel. Crawford had inherited a portion of his father&rsquo;s
      stubbornness; he was determined, she knew. He loved her and he meant what
      he said&mdash;if she would have him he would marry her in spite of his
      father. It made her proud and happy to know that. But she, too, was
      resolute and had meant what she said. She would not be the cause of a
      separation between father and son. And, besides, marriage had become for
      her a matter of the distant future; for the present her task was set there
      at South Harniss.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do? It was hard for Crawford, poor fellow. Yes, but it was
      hard for her, too. No one but she knew how hard. He would write her again
      telling her that his decision was unchanged, begging her to say she loved
      him, pleading with her to wait for him. And she would wait&mdash;Oh, how
      gladly, how joyfully she could wait&mdash;for him!&mdash;if she knew she
      was doing right in permitting him to wait for her. If she was sure that in
      permitting him to give up his father&rsquo;s love and his home and money and all
      that money could buy she was justified. There is a love which asks and a
      love which gives without asking return; the latter is the greater love and
      it was hers. She had written Crawford that perhaps she was not sure of her
      feeling toward him. That was not true. She was sure; but because she was
      fearful that his knowledge might be the means of entailing a great
      sacrifice on his part, she would not tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do? She considered, as the little Mary-&rsquo;Gusta used to
      consider her small problems in that very room. And the result of her
      considerations was rather unsatisfactory. There was nothing she could do
      now, nothing but wait until she heard again from Crawford. Then she would
      write.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brushed her eyes with her handkerchief and read the letter again.
      There were parts of it which she could not understand. She was almost
      inclined to adopt Crawford&rsquo;s suggestion that his father&rsquo;s mind might have
      been affected by his illness. Why had he received so passively the news
      that his son had fallen in love and yet become so violent when told the
      object of that love? He did not know her, Mary Lathrop; there could be no
      personal quality in his objection. And what could he have meant by asking
      if Zoeth Hamilton had sent Crawford to him? That was absolutely absurd.
      Zoeth, and Shadrach, too, had talked with Mary of Crawford&rsquo;s people in the
      West, but merely casually, as of complete strangers, which, of course,
      they were. It was all strange, but explainable if one considered that Mr.
      Smith was weak and ill and, perhaps, flighty. She must not think any more
      about it now&mdash;that is, she must try not to think. She must not give
      way, and above all she must not permit her uncles to suspect that she was
      troubled. She must try hard to put it from her mind until Crawford&rsquo;s next
      letter came.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that letter did not come. The week passed, then another, but there was
      no word from Crawford. Mary&rsquo;s anxiety grew. Each day as Isaiah brought the
      mail she expected him to give her an envelope addressed in the familiar
      handwriting, but he did not. She was growing nervous&mdash;almost fearful.
      And then came a happening the shock of which drove everything else from
      her mind for the time and substituted for that fear another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Tuesday and one o&rsquo;clock. Mary and Captain Shadrach, having had an
      early dinner, had returned to the store. Zoeth, upon their arrival, went
      down to the house for his own meal. Business, which had been very good
      indeed, was rather slack just then and Shadrach and Mary were talking
      together. Suddenly they heard the sound of rapid footsteps in the lane
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hoofin&rsquo; it up to the main road at that rate?&rdquo; demanded the Captain,
      lounging lazily toward the window. &ldquo;Has the town pump got on fire or is
      somebody goin&rsquo; for the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward to look. His laziness vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Jumpin&rsquo; Judas!&rdquo; he cried, springing to the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Isaiah, and
      runnin&rsquo; as if the Old Boy was after him! Here! You! Isaiah! What&rsquo;s the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah pounded up the platform steps and staggered against the doorpost.
      His face flamed so red that, as Shadrach said afterward, it was &ldquo;a wonder
      the perspiration didn&rsquo;t bile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&mdash;Oh, dear me! What shall
      I do? He&mdash;he&mdash;he&rsquo;s there on the floor and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, my
      godfreys! I&rsquo;m all out of wind! What SHALL I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk!&rdquo; roared the Captain. &ldquo;Talk! Use what wind you&rsquo;ve got for that!
      What&rsquo;s happened? Sing out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s all alone there!&rdquo; panted Mr. Chase. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t speak,
      scurcely&mdash;only moans. I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s he ain&rsquo;t dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dead? Who? Who? Who?&rdquo; The irate Shadrach seized his steward by the
      collar and shook him, not too gently. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Somebody
      will be next door to dead right here in a minute if you don&rsquo;t speak up
      instead of snortin&rsquo; like a puffin&rsquo; pig. What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah swallowed, gasped and waved a desperate hand. &ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; he
      protested. &ldquo;Zoeth&mdash;he&mdash;he&rsquo;s down in a heap on the kitchen floor.
      He&rsquo;s had a&mdash;a stroke or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God A&rsquo;mighty!&rdquo; cried Shadrach, and bolted out of the door. Mary followed
      him and a moment later, Mr. Chase followed her. The store was left to take
      care of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found poor Zoeth not exactly in a heap on the floor of the kitchen,
      but partially propped against one of the kitchen chairs. He was not
      unconscious but could speak only with difficulty. They carried him to the
      bedroom and Isaiah was sent on another gallop after the doctor. When the
      latter came he gave his patient a thorough examination and emerged from
      the sickroom looking grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must get a nurse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is likely to last a long while. It
      is a slight paralytic stroke, I should say, though what brought it on I
      haven&rsquo;t the least idea. Has Mr. Hamilton had any sudden shock or fright or
      anything of that sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not, so far as anyone knew. Isaiah, being questioned, told of
      Zoeth&rsquo;s coming in for dinner and of his&mdash;Isaiah&rsquo;s&mdash;handing him
      the morning&rsquo;s mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fetched it myself down from the post-office,&rdquo; said Isaiah. &ldquo;There was a
      couple of Hamilton and Company letters and the Wellmouth Register and one
      of them circulum advertisements about So-and-So&rsquo;s horse liniment, and, and&mdash;yes,
      seems to me there was a letter for Zoeth himself. He took &lsquo;em all and sot
      down in the kitchen to look &lsquo;em over. I went into the dinin&rsquo;-room. Next
      thing I knew I heard him say, &lsquo;O God!&rsquo; just like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast heavin&rsquo;, Isaiah!&rdquo; put in Captain Shadrach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re way off your
      course. Zoeth never said that. That&rsquo;s the way I talk, but he don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He done it this time,&rdquo; persisted Isaiah. &ldquo;I turned and looked through the
      doorway at him and he was standin&rsquo; in the middle of the kitchen floor.
      Seems to me he had a piece of white paper in his hand&mdash;seem&rsquo;s if he
      did. And then, afore I could say a word, he kind of groaned and sunk down
      in&mdash;in a pile, as you might say, right on the floor. And I couldn&rsquo;t
      get him up, nor get him to speak to me, nor nothin&rsquo;. Yet he must have come
      to enough to move after I left and to crawl acrost and lean against that
      chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse liniment circular and the Wellmouth Register were there on the
      kitchen table just where Mr. Hamilton had laid them. There, also, were the
      two letters addressed to Hamilton and Company. Of the letter which Isaiah
      seemed to remember as addressed to Zoeth personally, there was no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure there was such a letter, Isaiah?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase was not sure; that is to say, he was not sure more than a minute
      at a time. The minute following he was inclined to think he might have
      been mistaken, perhaps it was yesterday or the day before or even last
      week that his employer received such a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shadrach lost patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure &lsquo;twan&rsquo;t last Thanksgivin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Are you sure about
      anything? Are you sure how old you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by godfreys, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; roared Isaiah in desperation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so upsot
      ever since I looked into that kitchen and see the poor soul down on the
      floor there that&mdash;that all I&rsquo;m sure of is that I ain&rsquo;t sure of
      nothin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I blame you much, Isaiah,&rdquo; grunted the Captain.
      &ldquo;Anyway, it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference about that letter, so fur as I
      see, whether there was one or not. What did you want to know for, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary hesitated. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I&mdash;perhaps it is foolish, but
      the doctor said something about a shock being responsible for this
      dreadful thing and I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;I thought perhaps there might have
      been something in that letter which shocked or alarmed Uncle Zoeth. Of
      course it isn&rsquo;t probable that there was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any letter he&rsquo;d get of that
      kind. There&rsquo;s nobody to write it. He ain&rsquo;t got any relations nigher than
      third cousin, Zoeth ain&rsquo;t. Anyhow, we mustn&rsquo;t stop to guess riddles now.
      I&rsquo;ll hunt up the letter by and by, if there was one and I happen to think
      of it. Now I&rsquo;ve got to hunt up a nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was found, a Mrs. Deborah Atkins, of Ostable, and she arrived
      that night, bag and baggage, and took charge of the patient. Deborah was
      not ornamental, being elderly and, as Captain Shadrach said, built for
      tonnage more than speed; but she was sensible and capable. Also, her fee
      was not excessive, although that was by no means the principal reason for
      her selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what it costs,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Get the best you can. It&rsquo;s for
      Uncle Zoeth, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach&rsquo;s voice shook a little as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t likely to forget,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Zoeth and I&rsquo;ve cruised together for
      a good many years and if one of us has to go under I&rsquo;d rather &lsquo;twas me. I
      haven&rsquo;t got much money but what I&rsquo;ve got is his, and after that so long as
      I can get trusted. But there,&rdquo; with an attempt at optimism, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
      fret, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Nobody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; under yet. We&rsquo;ll have Zoeth up on deck
      doin&rsquo; the fishers&rsquo; hornpipe in a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was soon plain to everyone, the Captain included, that many times
      two weeks must elapse before Mr. Hamilton would be able to appear on deck
      again, to say nothing of dancing hornpipes. For days he lay in partial
      coma, rallying occasionally and speaking at rare intervals but evidently
      never fully aware of where he was and what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will recover, I think,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;but it will be a slow job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary did not again refer to the letter regarding which Isaiah&rsquo;s memory was
      so befogged. In fact, she forgot it entirely. So also did Captain Shad.
      For both the worry of Zoeth&rsquo;s illness and the care of the store were
      sufficient to drive trifles from their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for Mary there was another trouble, one which she must keep to
      herself. Three weeks had elapsed since Crawford&rsquo;s letter, that telling of
      his two fateful interviews with his father, and still no word had come
      from him. Mary could not understand his silence. In vain she called her
      philosophy to her rescue, striving to think that after all it was best if
      she never heard from him again, best that a love affair which could never
      end happily were ended at once, best that he should come to see the
      question as his father saw it&mdash;best for him, that is, for his future
      would then be one of ease and happiness. All this she thought&mdash;and
      then found herself wondering why he had not written, imagining all sorts
      of direful happenings and feeling herself responsible.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening, about a week after Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s sudden seizure, Mary was in
      her room alone. She had again reread Crawford&rsquo;s latest letter and was
      sitting there trying to imagine the scene as he had described it. She was
      trying to picture Edwin Smith, the man who&mdash;as his son had so often
      told her&mdash;indulged that son&rsquo;s every whim, was kindness and parental
      love personified, and yet had raved and stormed like a madman because the
      boy wished to marry her, Mary Lathrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, opened the drawer of her bureau, and took out the photograph of
      Mr. Smith, the one which showed him without his beard, the one taken since
      his illness. Crawford had written that this photograph, too, had been
      taken on the sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s prejudice against photos is as keen as ever,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;He would
      slaughter me on the spot if he knew I had snapped him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face in the picture was not that of the savage, unrelenting parent of
      the old plays, who used to disinherit his sons and drive his daughters out
      into blinding snowstorms because they dared thwart his imperial will.
      Edwin Smith was distinctly a handsome man, gray-haired, of course, and
      strong-featured, but with a kind rather than a stern expression. As Mary
      had said when she first saw his likeness, he looked as if he might have
      had experiences. In this photograph he looked very grave, almost sad, but
      possibly that was because of his recent sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at the picture when Isaiah&rsquo;s voice was heard outside the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Chase. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t turned in yet, have you?
      Can I speak with you a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Isaiah,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah entered. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; special,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was just goin&rsquo; to
      tell you that Debby T. cal&rsquo;lates Zoeth is a little mite easier tonight.
      She just said so and I thought you&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By &ldquo;Debby T.&rdquo; Isaiah meant Mrs. Atkins. Mary understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Isaiah,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am ever so glad to hear it. Thank you
      for telling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Hello! who&rsquo;s tintype&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had caught sight of the photograph upon the arm of Mary&rsquo;s chair. He
      picked it up and looked at it. She heard him gasp. Turning, she saw him
      staring at the photograph with an expression of absolute amazement&mdash;amazement
      and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Isaiah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah, not taking his eyes from the picture, extended it in one hand and
      pointed to it excitedly with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For godfreys mighty sakes!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get what? The photograph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes, yes! Where&rsquo;d you get it? Where&rsquo;d it come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sent to me. What of it? What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah answered neither question. He seemed to have heard only the first
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SENT to you!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop, have you been tryin&rsquo; to
      find out&mdash;Look here! who sent you Ed Farmer&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary stared at him. &ldquo;WHOSE picture?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What are you talking
      about, Isaiah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah thrust the photograph still closer to the end of her nose. Also he
      continued to point at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sent you Ed Farmer&rsquo;s picture?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Where&mdash;where&rsquo;d you
      get it? You tell me, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked him over from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to send for Uncle Shad or the doctor,&rdquo; she said,
      slowly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t stop hopping up and down and waving your arms as if
      they worked by strings I shall probably send for both. Isaiah Chase,
      behave yourself! What is the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah, during his years as sea cook, had learned to obey orders. Mary&rsquo;s
      tone had its effect upon him. He dropped one hand, but he still held the
      photograph in the other. And he stared at it as if it possessed some sort
      of horrible charm which frightened and fascinated at the same time. Mary
      had never seen him so excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ed Farmer!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, I swan to man! I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;Say,
      it IS him, ain&rsquo;t it, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? But of course &lsquo;tis! I can see &lsquo;tis with
      my own eyes. My godfreys mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know you were a blue ribboner, Isaiah,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I should be suspicious. That photograph was sent me from the
      West. It is a picture of a gentleman named Edwin Smith, someone I have
      never seen and I&rsquo;m perfectly sure you never have. Why in the world it
      should make you behave as if you needed a strait-jacket I can&rsquo;t see. Does
      Mr. Smith resemble someone you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah&rsquo;s mouth fell open and remained so as he gazed first at the
      photograph and then at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ed&mdash;Edwin Smith,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Edwin Smith! I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know no
      Edwin Smith. Look here, now; honest, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, AIN&rsquo;T that a picture of
      Ed Farmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed. &ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who is Ed Farmer, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah did not answer. He was holding the photograph near the end of his
      own nose now and examining it with eager scrutiny, muttering comments as
      he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t him it&rsquo;s a better picture than if &lsquo;twas,&rdquo; was one of his
      amazing observations. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem as if two folks could look so much alike
      and not be. And yet&mdash;and yet I can see&mdash;I can see now&mdash;this
      feller&rsquo;s hair&rsquo;s pretty nigh white and Ed&rsquo;s was dark brown. But then if
      this feller was Ed he&rsquo;d be&mdash;he&rsquo;d be&mdash;let&rsquo;s see&mdash;he&rsquo;d be all
      of thirty-five years older than he was thirty-five years ago and that
      would account&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do be still, Isaiah!&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;You are perfectly idiotic. That
      man&rsquo;s name is Smith, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase heaved a sigh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sartin &lsquo;tis?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then I cal&rsquo;late it must be. But if Ed Farmer had lived all these
      years and had had his tintype took he wouldn&rsquo;t get one to favor him more
      than that does, I bet you. My, it give me a start, comin&rsquo; onto me so
      unexpected!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is Ed Farmer?&rdquo; asked Mary. The name had meant nothing to her so
      far. And yet, even as she spoke she remembered. Her expression changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; she cried, eagerly. &ldquo;Why, Isaiah, do you mean the man
      in that old photograph I found in the garret ever and ever so long ago?
      The one you told me was a&mdash;a blackguard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah, still staring at Mr. Smith&rsquo;s likeness, answered emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one I meant. My, this feller does
      look like him, or the way I cal&rsquo;late he would look if he lived as long as
      this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. We don&rsquo;t any of us know around here. I ain&rsquo;t laid eyes on
      him since the day afore it happened. I remember just as well as if &lsquo;twas
      yesterday. He come out of the office onto the wharf where I was workin&rsquo; 
      and he says to me, &lsquo;Isaiah,&rsquo; he says, knockin&rsquo; on the head of a barrel
      with his hand&mdash;the right hand &lsquo;twas, the one that had the bent
      finger; he got it smashed under a hogshead of salt one time and it never
      came straight again&mdash;&lsquo;Isaiah,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a nice day, ain&rsquo;t it.&rsquo; 
      And I answered up prompt&mdash;I liked him fust-rate; everybody liked him
      them days&mdash;&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;this is a good enough day to go see
      your best girl in.&rsquo; I never meant nothin&rsquo; by it, you understand, just a
      sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;twas, but it seemed to give him a kind of start. He looked at me
      hard. &lsquo;Did anyone tell you where I was goin&rsquo;?&rsquo; says he, sharp. &lsquo;Why, no,&rsquo; 
      says I. &lsquo;Why should they?&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t answer, just kept on starin&rsquo; at me.
      Then he laughed and walked away. I didn&rsquo;t know where he was goin&rsquo; then,
      but I know now, darn him! And the next day he went&mdash;for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped speaking. Mary waited a moment and then asked, quietly: &ldquo;Went
      where, Isaiah? Where did he go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah, who was standing, the photograph still in his hand, started,
      turned and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, where did this Mr. Farmer go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. He went away, that&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t ask me any more
      questions. I&rsquo;ve been talkin&rsquo; too much, anyhow, I cal&rsquo;late. Cap&rsquo;n Shad
      would skin me alive if he knew I&rsquo;d said as much as I have. Say,
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, don&rsquo;t you say nothin&rsquo; to either him or Zoeth, will you? You
      see&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a kind of little secret we have amongst us and&mdash;and
      nobody else is in on it. &lsquo;Twas this plaguey tintype got me to talkin&rsquo;. No
      wonder neither! I never see such a look on two folks. I&mdash;there,
      there! Good night, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed the photograph on the bureau and hurried out of the room. Mary
      called after him, but he would neither stop nor answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had gone Mary took up the photograph, seated herself once more in
      the chair, and studied the picture for a long time. Then she rose and,
      lamp in hand, left the room, tiptoed along the hall past the door of
      Captain Shadrach&rsquo;s room, and up the narrow stairs to the attic, her old
      playground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her playthings were there still, arranged in her customary orderly fashion
      along the walls. Rose and Rosette and Minnehaha and the other dolls were
      seated in their chairs or the doll carriage or with their backs against
      Shadrach&rsquo;s old sea chest. She had never put them away out of sight.
      Somehow it seemed more like home to her, the knowledge that though she
      would never play with them again, they were there waiting for her in their
      old places. While she was away at school they had been covered from the
      dust by a cloth, but now the cloth had been taken away and she herself
      dusted them every other morning before going up to the store. As Shadrach
      said, no one but Mary-&rsquo;Gusta would ever have thought of doing such a
      thing. She did, because she WAS Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the dolls did not interest her now. She tiptoed across the garret
      floor, taking great care to avoid the boards which creaked most, and
      lifted the lid of the old trunk which she had first opened on that
      Saturday afternoon nearly ten years before. She found the pocket on the
      under side of the lid, opened it and inserted her hand. Yes, the
      photograph of Hall and Company was still there, she could feel the edge of
      it with her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it out, and closed the pocket and then the trunk, and tiptoed
      down the stairs and to her room again. She closed the door, locked it&mdash;something
      she had never done in her life before&mdash;and placing the photograph she
      had taken from the trunk beside that sent her by Crawford, sat down to
      compare them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as she looked at the two photographs her wonder at Isaiah&rsquo;s odd
      behavior ceased. It was not strange that when he saw Mr. Edwin Smith&rsquo;s
      likeness he was astonished; it was not remarkable that he could scarcely
      be convinced the photograph was not that of the mysterious Ed Farmer. For
      here in the old, yellow photograph of the firm of &ldquo;Hall and Company,
      Wholesale Fish Dealers,&rdquo; was Edgar S. Farmer, and here in the photograph
      sent her by Crawford was Edwin Smith. And save that Edgar S. Farmer was a
      young man and Edwin Smith a man in the middle sixties, they were almost
      identical in appearance. Each time she had seen Mr. Smith&rsquo;s photograph she
      had felt certain she must have met the original. Here was the reason&mdash;this
      man in the other photograph. The only difference was the difference of
      age. Edwin Smith had a nose like Edgar Farmer&rsquo;s, and a chin like his and
      eyes like his. And Isaiah had just said that Edgar Farmer had a crooked
      finger on his right hand caused by an accident with a hogshead of salt.
      Mary remembered well something Crawford had told her, that his father had
      a finger on the right hand which had been hurt in a mine years before he,
      Crawford, was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be, of course&mdash;it could not be&mdash;and yet&mdash;Oh,
      WHAT did it mean?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his own room at the end of the second-story hall, over the kitchen, Mr.
      Chase was sitting reading the local paper before retiring. It was a habit
      he had, one of which Captain Shadrach pretended to approve highly. &ldquo;Best
      thing in the world, Isaiah,&rdquo; declared the Captain. &ldquo;Sleep&rsquo;s what everybody
      needs and I can&rsquo;t think of any surer way of gettin&rsquo; to sleep than readin&rsquo; 
      the South Harniss news in that paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not this unkind joke was deserved is not material; at all
      events Isaiah was reading the paper when he was very much startled by a
      knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who is it?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mary,&rdquo; whispered a voice outside the door. &ldquo;I want to speak with
      you, Isaiah. You&rsquo;re not in bed, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah reluctantly relinquished the paper. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
      in bed. What&rsquo;s the matter? Zoeth ain&rsquo;t no worse, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me in and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in. You don&rsquo;t need no lettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary entered. She was very grave and very earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the nation,&rdquo; began Isaiah, &ldquo;are you prowlin&rsquo; around this hour of
      the night for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Isaiah, you must tell me everything now. There&rsquo;s no use to say you
      won&rsquo;t&mdash;you MUST. Who was Edgar Farmer and what wrong did he do my
      uncles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah said nothing; he did not attempt to answer. Instead he gaped at her
      with such an expression of guilty surprise, fright, and apprehension that
      at any other time she would have laughed. Just now, however, she was far
      from laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; she said, impatiently. &ldquo;I mean it. I want you to tell me all
      about this Edgar Farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I told you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me a very little. Now I want to know the rest. Everyone else in
      this family knows it and it is time I did. I&rsquo;m not a child any more. Tell
      me the whole story, Isaiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t neither. Oh, by godfreys, this is what I get by sayin&rsquo; more&rsquo;n I
      ought to! And yet how could I help it when I see that tintype? It&rsquo;s just
      my luck! Nobody else but me would have had the dratted luck to have that
      picture stuck into their face and eyes unexpected. And &lsquo;twas just so when
      you found that other one years ago up attic. I had to be the one you
      sprung it on! I had to be! But I shan&rsquo;t tell you nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will. You must tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then I shall go straight to Uncle Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To who? To CAP&rsquo;N SHAD! Oh, my godfreys mighty! You go to him and see what
      he&rsquo;ll say! Just go! Why, he&rsquo;d shut up tighter&rsquo;n a clam at low water and
      he&rsquo;d give you fits besides. Go to Cap&rsquo;n Shad and ask about Ed Farmer! My
      soul! You try it! Aw, don&rsquo;t be foolish, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be foolish, Isaiah. If I go to Uncle Shad I shall tell
      him that it was through you I learned there was such a person as the
      Farmer man and that there was a secret connected with him, that it was a
      disagreeable secret, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Land sakes alive! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, DON&rsquo;T talk so! Why, if you told
      Cap&rsquo;n Shad he&rsquo;d&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what he wouldn&rsquo;t do to me. If he knew I
      told you about Ed Farmer he&rsquo;d&mdash;I swan to man I believe he&rsquo;d pretty
      nigh kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll soon know what he will do, for unless you tell me the whole
      story, I shall certainly go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surely shall. And if he won&rsquo;t tell me I shall go to someone outside the
      family&mdash;to Judge Baxter, perhaps. He would tell me, I&rsquo;m sure, if I
      asked. No, Isaiah, you tell me. And if you do tell me all freely and
      frankly, keeping nothing back, I&rsquo;ll say nothing to Uncle Shad or Uncle
      Zoeth. They shall never know who told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase wrung his hands. Ever since he had been cook at the white house
      by the shore he had had this duty laid upon him, the duty of keeping his
      lips closed upon the name of Edgar Farmer and the story connected with
      that name. When Captain Shadrach first engaged him for his present
      situation the Captain had ordered him never to speak the name or mention
      the happenings of that time. And after little Mary Lathrop became a
      regular and most important member of the family, the command was repeated.
      &ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t ever know if we can help it, Isaiah,&rdquo; said Shadrach,
      solemnly. &ldquo;You know Zoeth and how he feels. For his sake, if nothin&rsquo; else,
      we mustn&rsquo;t any of us drop a hint so that she will know. She&rsquo;ll find out, I
      presume likely, when she gets older; there&rsquo;ll be some kind soul around
      town that&rsquo;ll tell her, consarn &lsquo;em; but WE shan&rsquo;t tell her; and if YOU
      tell her, Isaiah Chase, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I declare to man I&rsquo;ll heave you
      overboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now after all these years of ignorance during which the expected had
      not happened and no one of the village gossips had revealed the secret to
      her&mdash;now, here she was, demanding that he, Isaiah Chase, reveal it,
      and threatening to go straight to Captain Gould and tell who had put her
      upon the scent. No wonder the cook and steward wrung his hands in despair;
      the heaving overboard was imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, earnest and determined as she was to learn the truth, the truth
      which she was beginning to believe might mean so much to her, nevertheless
      could not help pitying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Isaiah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look so tragic. There isn&rsquo;t
      anything so dreadful about it. Have you promised&mdash;have you given your
      word not to tell? Because if you have I shan&rsquo;t ask you to break it. I
      shall go to Judge Baxter instead&mdash;or to Uncle Shad. But of course I
      shall be obliged to tell how I came to know&mdash;the little I do know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase did not like the prospect of her going to the Captain, that was
      plain. For the first time his obstinacy seemed to waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I ever give my word,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I never
      promised nothin&rsquo;, as I recollect. Cap&rsquo;n Shad he give me orders&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, of course he did. Well, now I&rsquo;M giving you orders. And I
      promise you, Isaiah, if it ever becomes necessary I&rsquo;ll stand between you
      and Uncle Shad. Now tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah sat down upon the bed and wiped his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lordy!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;I wisht my mouth had been sewed up afore ever I
      said a word about any of it. . . . But&mdash;but . . . Well,&rdquo; desperately,
      &ldquo;what is it you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know everything. Begin at the beginning and tell me who Mr.
      Farmer was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase marked a pattern on the floor with his slippered foot. Then he
      began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He come from up Cape Ann way in the beginnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rest of the
      firm was Cape Codders, but he wan&rsquo;t. However, he&rsquo;d been a-fishin&rsquo; and he
      knew fish and after the firm was fust started and needed an extry
      bookkeeper he applied and got the job. There was three of &lsquo;em in Hall and
      Company at fust, all young men they was, too; your stepfather, Cap&rsquo;n
      Marcellus Hall, he was the head one; and Mr. Zoeth, he was next and Cap&rsquo;n
      Shad next. &lsquo;Twan&rsquo;t until three or four year afterwards that Ed Farmer was
      took in partner. He was so smart and done so well they give him a share
      and took him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody liked him, too. He was younger even than the rest, and fine
      lookin&rsquo; and he had a&mdash;a kind of way with him that just made you like
      him. The way the business was handled was somethin&rsquo; like this: Cap&rsquo;n
      Marcellus, your stepfather, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, he and Cap&rsquo;n Shad done the
      outside managin&rsquo;, bossin&rsquo; the men&mdash;we had a lot of &lsquo;em on the wharf
      them days, too, and there was always schooners unloadin&rsquo; and carts loadin&rsquo; 
      up and fellers headin&rsquo; up barrels&mdash;Oh, Hall and Company&rsquo;s store and
      docks was the busiest place on the South Shore. You ask anybody that
      remembers and they&rsquo;ll tell you so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cap&rsquo;n Marcellus and Cap&rsquo;n Shad was sort of outside bosses, same as
      I said, and Zoeth he was sort of general business boss, &lsquo;tendin&rsquo; to the
      buyin&rsquo; supplies and payin&rsquo; for &lsquo;em and gettin&rsquo; money and the like of that,
      and Ed&mdash;Edgar Farmer, I mean&mdash;he was inside office boss, lookin&rsquo; 
      out for the books and the collections and the bank account and so on.
      Marcellus and Zoeth and Cap&rsquo;n Shad was old chums and had been for years;
      they was as much to each other as brothers and always had been; but it
      wan&rsquo;t so very long afore they thought as much of Farmer as they did of
      themselves. He was that kind&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t help takin&rsquo; a notion to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I get to talkin&rsquo; about Hall and Company I could talk for a month of
      Sundays. Them was great days&mdash;yes, sir, great days for South Harniss
      and the fish business. Why I&rsquo;ve seen, of a Saturday mornin&rsquo; in the
      mackerel season, as many as forty men ashore right here in town with money
      in their pockets and their hats on onesided, lookin&rsquo; for fun or trouble
      just as happened along. And Cap&rsquo;n Marcellus and his partners was looked up
      to and respected; not much more&rsquo;n boys they wan&rsquo;t, but they was big-bugs,
      I tell you, and they wore beaver hats to church on Sunday, every man jack
      of &lsquo;em. Fur&rsquo;s that goes, I wore one, too, and you might not think it, but
      &lsquo;twas becomin&rsquo; to me if I do say it. Yes, sir-ee! &lsquo;Twas a kind of curl-up
      brim one, that hat was, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the hat now, Isaiah,&rdquo; interrupted Mary. &ldquo;Tell me about Mr.
      Farmer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked offended. &ldquo;I am tellin&rsquo; you, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I
      tellin&rsquo; you fast as I can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are. We won&rsquo;t argue about it. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, where was I? You&rsquo;ve put me clear off my course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were just going to tell me what Mr. Farmer did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What he did! What didn&rsquo;t he do, you&rsquo;d better say! The blackguard! He
      smashed the firm flat, that&rsquo;s what he done! And he run off with
      Marcellus&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcellus&rsquo;s sister! My stepfather&rsquo;s sister! I didn&rsquo;t know he ever had a
      sister. Are you sure he had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I sure! What kind of talk&rsquo;s that? Course I&rsquo;m sure! She was younger
      than Marcellus and pretty&mdash;say, she WAS pretty! Yes, the outside of
      her figurehead was mighty hard to beat, everybody said so; but the inside
      was kind of&mdash;well, kind of rattly, as you might say. She&rsquo;d laugh and
      talk and go on and Ed Farmer he&rsquo;d hang over the desk there in the office
      and look at her. Just look&mdash;and look&mdash;and look. How many times
      I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;em that way! It got so that folks begun to talk a little mite.
      Marcellus didn&rsquo;t, of course; he idolized that girl, worshiped her like a
      vain thing, so&rsquo;s to speak. And Cap&rsquo;n Shad, course he wouldn&rsquo;t talk because
      he&rsquo;s always down on tattle-tales and liars, but I&rsquo;ve always thought he was
      a little mite suspicious and troubled. As for poor Zoeth&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s
      always his kind that are the last to suspect. And Zoeth was as innocent
      then as he is now. And as good, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then one day it come out, come down on us like the mainmast goin&rsquo; by
      the board. No, come to think of it, it didn&rsquo;t come all to once that way.
      Part of it did, but the rest didn&rsquo;t. The rest kind of leaked out along
      slow, gettin&rsquo; a little mite worse every day. I can see it just as plain as
      if &lsquo;twas yesterday&mdash;Marcellus and Shadrach in the office goin&rsquo; over
      the books and addin&rsquo; up on pieces of paper, and it gettin&rsquo; worse and worse
      all the time. And the whole town a-talkin&rsquo;! And poor Zoeth lyin&rsquo; in his
      bedroom there to home, out of his mind and ravin&rsquo; distracted and beggin&rsquo; 
      and pleadin&rsquo; with his partners not to chase &lsquo;em, to let &lsquo;em go free for
      her sake. And the doctor a-comin&rsquo;! And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary began to feel that she, too, was in danger of raving distraction.
      Between her anxiety to hear the story and her forebodings and growing
      suspicions she was becoming more and more nervous as Isaiah rambled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Wait, please, Isaiah!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. What had
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah regarded her with surprise and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I been tellin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; he snapped, testily. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I this minute told
      you? This Ed Farmer had cleared out and run off and he&rsquo;d took with him
      every cent of Hall and Company&rsquo;s money that he could rake and scrape. He&rsquo;d
      been stealin&rsquo; and speculatin&rsquo; for years, it turned out. &lsquo;Twas him, the dum
      thief, him and his stealin&rsquo;s that made the firm fail. Wan&rsquo;t that enough to
      happen, I&rsquo;d like to know? But that wan&rsquo;t all; no, sir, that wan&rsquo;t the
      worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, evidently expecting his hearer to make some comment. She was
      leaning forward, her eyes fixed upon his face, but she did not speak. Mr.
      Chase, judging by her expression that he had created the sensation which,
      as story-teller, he considered his due, went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir-ee! that wan&rsquo;t the worst of it. You and me might have thought
      losin&rsquo; all our money was the worst that could be, but Marcellus and
      Shadrach didn&rsquo;t think so. Marcellus was pretty nigh stove in himself&mdash;there
      was nothin&rsquo; on earth he loved the way he loved that sister of his&mdash;but
      when he and Cap&rsquo;n Shad thought of poor Zoeth they couldn&rsquo;t think of much
      else. Shadrach had liked her and Marcellus had loved her, but Zoeth had
      fairly bowed down and worshiped the ground she trod on. Anything she
      wanted, no matter what, she could have if &lsquo;twas in Zoeth&rsquo;s power to get it
      for her. He&rsquo;d humored her and spiled her as if she was a child and all he
      asked for doin&rsquo; it was that she&rsquo;d pat him on the head once in a while,
      same as you would a dog. And now she&rsquo;d gone&mdash;run off with that thief!
      Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary interrupted again. &ldquo;Wait! Wait, Isaiah,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I tell you I
      don&rsquo;t understand. You say&mdash;you say Captain Hall&rsquo;s sister had gone
      with Mr. Farmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin! she run off with him and nobody&rsquo;s laid eyes on either of &lsquo;em
      since. That was why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop! What I don&rsquo;t understand is why Uncle Zoeth was so stricken by
      the news. Why had HE humored and spoiled her? Was he in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah stared at her in blank astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love with her!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Course he was! Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be? Wan&rsquo;t
      she his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about the sensation now. The color slowly faded from
      Mary&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His WIFE?&rdquo; she repeated slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin! They&rsquo;d been married &lsquo;most five year. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? She was a
      good deal younger&rsquo;n he was, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! What&mdash;what was her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that neither? That&rsquo;s funny. Her name was Patience&mdash;Patience
      Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last doubt was gone. Clear and distinct to Mary&rsquo;s mind came a sentence
      of Crawford&rsquo;s: &ldquo;I saw her name first on the gravestone and it made an
      impression on me because it was so quaint and old-fashioned. &lsquo;Patience,
      wife of Edwin Smith.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard very little of Isaiah&rsquo;s story thereafter. Scattered sentences
      reached her ears. Isaiah was telling how, because of Zoeth&rsquo;s pleading and
      the latter&rsquo;s desire to avoid all the public scandal possible, no attempt
      was made to trace the fugitives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went West somewheres,&rdquo; said Isaiah. &ldquo;Anyhow &lsquo;twas supposed they did
      &lsquo;cause they was seen together on the Chicago train by an Orham man that
      knew Farmer. Anybody but Marcellus and your uncles, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, would
      have sot the sheriff on their track and hauled &lsquo;em back here and made that
      Farmer swab give up what he stole. I don&rsquo;t imagine he had such a terrible
      lot with him, I cal&rsquo;late the heft of it had gone in stock speculatin&rsquo;, but
      he must have had somethin&rsquo; and they could have got a-holt of that. But no,
      Zoeth he says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t follow &lsquo;em! For her sake and mine&mdash;don&rsquo;t make
      the shame more public than &lsquo;tis.&rsquo; You see, Zoeth was the same then as he
      is now; you&rsquo;d have thought HE was to blame to hear him talk. He never said
      a word against her then nor since. A mighty good man, your Uncle Zoeth
      Hamilton is, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Saint on earth, I call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell how Marcellus and Shadrach had fought to keep the firm
      on its feet, how for a time it struggled on against the load of debt left
      it by their former partner, only to go down at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcellus went down with it, as you might say,&rdquo; continued Isaiah.
      &ldquo;Between losin&rsquo; his sister and losin&rsquo; his business he never was the same
      man afterwards, though he did make consider&rsquo;ble money in other ways. Him
      and Cap&rsquo;n Shadrach both went back to seafarin&rsquo; again and after a spell I
      went with &lsquo;em. Poor Zoeth, when he got on his feet, which took a long
      spell, he started a little store that by and by, when Cap&rsquo;n Shad joined in
      with him, was Hamilton and Company, same as now. And when Shadrach come I
      come too, as cook and steward, you understand. But from that day to this
      there&rsquo;s been two names never mentioned in this house, one&rsquo;s Patience
      Hall&rsquo;s and t&rsquo;other&rsquo;s Ed Farmer&rsquo;s. You can see now why, when I thought that
      tintype was his, I was so took aback. You see, don&rsquo;t you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?
      Why! Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had risen from her chair, taken up the lamp, and was on her way to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to my room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good night, Isaiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you goin&rsquo; now for? I could tell you a lot more partic&rsquo;lars if
      you wanted to hear &lsquo;em. Now I&rsquo;ve told so much I might as well tell the
      rest. If I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be hove overboard for tellin&rsquo; I might as well make a
      big splash as a little one. If you got any questions to ask, heave ahead
      and ask &lsquo;em. Fire away, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he added, recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mary shook her head. She did not even turn to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I may ask them some other time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Not now. Thank you
      for telling me so much. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alone in her own room once more she sat down to think. It was plain enough
      now. All the parts of the puzzle fitted together. Edwin Smith having been
      proved to be Edgar Farmer, everything was explainable. It had seemed queer
      to her, Mr. Smith&rsquo;s aversion to the East, his refusal to come East even to
      his son&rsquo;s graduation; but it was not at all queer that Edgar Farmer, the
      embezzler, should feel such an aversion, or refuse to visit a locality
      where, even after all these years, he might be recognized. It was not odd
      that he disliked to be photographed. And it certainly was not strange that
      he should have behaved as he did when his son announced the intention of
      marrying her, Mary Lathrop, stepdaughter of one of his former partners and
      victims&rsquo; and adopted niece and ward of the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a terrible surprise and shock Crawford&rsquo;s communication must have been
      to him! The dead past, the past he no doubt had believed buried forever,
      had risen from the tomb to confront him. His only son, the boy he
      idolized, who believed him to be a man of honor, whose love and respect
      meant more than the world to him&mdash;his only son asking to marry the
      ward of the man whom he had wronged beyond mortal forgiveness, asking to
      marry her and intimating that he would marry her whether or no. And the
      secret which he had guarded so jealously, had hidden from his son and the
      world with such infinite pains, suddenly threatening to be cried aloud in
      the streets for all, his boy included, to hear. Mary shuddered as she
      realized what the man must have felt. It must have seemed to him like the
      direct hand of avenging Providence. No wonder he at first could not
      believe it to be merely accident, coincidence; no wonder that he asked if
      Zoeth Hamilton had sent Crawford to him, and had demanded to know what
      Zoeth Hamilton had told.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dreadful, it was pitiful. She found herself pitying Edwin Smith&mdash;or
      Edgar Farmer&mdash;even though she knew the retribution which had come
      upon him was deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pitied him&mdash;yes; but now she could spare little pity for others,
      she needed as much herself. For minute by minute, as she sat there
      thinking out this great problem just as the little Mary-&rsquo;Gusta used to
      think out her small ones, her duty became clear and more clear to her
      mind. Edgar Farmer&rsquo;s secret must be kept. For Crawford&rsquo;s sake it must be.
      He need not&mdash;he must not&mdash;learn that the father he had honored
      and respected all his life was unworthy of that honor and respect. And her
      uncles&mdash;they must not know. The old skeleton must not be dug from its
      grave. Her Uncle Zoeth had told her only a little while before that he was
      learning to forget, or if not to forget at least to be more reconciled.
      She did not understand him then; now she did. To have him learn that Edgar
      Farmer was alive, that his son&mdash;Oh, no, he must not learn it! Ill as
      he was, and weak as he was likely to be always, the shock might kill him.
      And yet sooner or later he would learn unless the secret remained, as it
      had been for years, undisclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to keep it still a secret was, she saw clearly, her duty. She might
      rebel against it, she might feel that it was wicked and cruel, the
      spoiling of her life to save these others, but it was her duty
      nevertheless. Because she loved Crawford&mdash;and she was realizing now
      that she did love him dearly, that there could never be another love in
      the world for her&mdash;-she must send him away, she must end the affair
      at once. If she did that she could save him from learning of his father&rsquo;s
      disgrace, could avert the otherwise inevitable quarrel between them, could
      make his career and his future secure. And her uncles would be happy, the
      skeleton would remain undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she must do it. But it was so hard to do. Philosophy did not help in
      the least. She had tried to convince herself when she gave up her school
      work that it meant the end of her romance also. She had tried to tell
      Crawford so. But she had been weak, she had permitted herself to hope. She
      had realized that for the present, perhaps for years, she must work for
      and with the old men who had been father and mother both to her, but&mdash;he
      had said so&mdash;Crawford would wait for her, and some day&mdash;perhaps&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But now there was no perhaps&mdash;now she knew. She must receive no more
      letters from him. She must never see him again. The break must be absolute
      and final. And there was but one way to bring that about. He had said
      repeatedly that only her declaration that she did not love him would ever
      prevent his marrying her. Very well, then for his sake she must lie to
      him; she must tell him that very thing. She must write him that she had
      been considering the matter and had decided she could never love him
      enough to become his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost two o&rsquo;clock when she reached this decision but she sat down
      at her desk to write then and there the letter containing it, the last
      letter she would ever write him. And when the morning light came streaming
      in at the windows she still sat there, the letter unwritten. She had made
      many beginnings, but not an end. She must try again; she was too tired,
      too nervous, too hopeless and heartbroken to make another attempt that
      morning, but before the day was over it should be done. She threw herself
      down upon the bed but she could not sleep. Why had she been selected to
      bear this burden? What had she done that God should delight to torture her
      in this way?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      That difficult letter was never written. In the afternoon, business at the
      store being rather quiet and Mrs. Atkins, the nurse, desiring an hour&rsquo;s
      leave to do an errand in the village, Mary had taken her place in the
      sickroom. Zoeth was improving slowly, so the doctor said, but he took very
      little interest in what went on, speaking but seldom, asking few
      questions, and seeming to be but partially sensible of his surroundings.
      Best not to try to rouse him, the physician said. Little by little he
      would gain mentally as well as physically and, by and by, there was reason
      to hope, would be up and about again. Probably, however, he would never be
      so strong as he had been before his sudden seizure, the cause of which&mdash;if
      there had been a definite cause&mdash;was still unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then he was asleep and Mary, sitting in the rocking-chair by the bed,
      was thinking, thinking, thinking. If she could only stop thinking for a
      little while! Uncle Zoeth, there on the bed, looked so calm and peaceful.
      If only she might have rest and peace again! If she might be allowed to
      forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened gently and Mr. Chase appeared. He beckoned to her to come
      out. With a glance at the patient, she tiptoed from the room into the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Isaiah?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah seemed to be excited about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a surprise for you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      somebody downstairs to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner was so important and mysterious that Mary was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone to see me?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s somebody you wan&rsquo;t expectin&rsquo; to see, I bet you!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I
      know I wan&rsquo;t. When I opened the door and see him standin&rsquo; there I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw him? Who? Who is it, Isaiah? Stop that ridiculous winking this
      instant. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that young Crawford Smith feller from way out West, that&rsquo;s who &lsquo;tis.
      Ah, ha! I told you you&rsquo;d be surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was surprised, there could be no doubt of that. For a moment she stood
      perfectly still. Had it not been that the hall was almost dark in the
      shadows of the late afternoon Isaiah would have noticed how pale she had
      become. But it was evident that he did not notice it, for he chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d be some surprised,&rdquo; he crowed. &ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you comin&rsquo; 
      on down to see him? Seems to me if I had a beau&mdash;excuse me, a
      gentleman friend&mdash;who come a-cruisin&rsquo; all the way from t&rsquo;other side
      of creation to see me I wouldn&rsquo;t keep him waitin&rsquo; very long. Ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary did not answer at once. When she did she was surprised to find that
      she was able to speak so calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be down in a moment,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isaiah, will you please go in
      and stay with Uncle Zoeth until I come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked chagrined and disappointed. Visitors from the far West were
      rare and especially rare was a young gentleman who Mr. Chase, with what
      Captain Shadrach termed his &ldquo;lovesick imagination,&rdquo; surmised was
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s beau. He wished to see more of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, say, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful busy. I don&rsquo;t see how I can
      set along of Zoeth&mdash;Say, Mary&rsquo;Gusta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mary had gone. She was hurrying along the hall toward her own room. So
      Isaiah, remembering that the doctor had said Mr. Hamilton must not be left
      alone, grumblingly obeyed orders and went in to sit beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her own room Mary stood, white and shaken, striving to regain her
      composure. She must regain it, she must be cool and calm in order to go
      through the ordeal she knew was before her. His coming could mean but one
      thing: his father had still refused consent and he had come to tell her so
      and to beg her to wait for him in spite of it. If only he had written
      saying he was coming, if she had been forewarned, then she might have been
      more ready, more prepared. Now she must summon all her resolution and be
      firm and unwavering. Her purpose was as set and strong as ever, but ah, it
      would be so hard to tell him! To write the letter she had meant to write
      would have been easy compared to this. However, it must be done&mdash;and
      done now. She went down the stairs and entered the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting in the rocker by the window and when she came into the room
      he sprang to his feet and came toward her. His face, or so it seemed to
      her, showed some traces of the trouble and anxiety through which he had
      passed so recently. He was a little thinner and he looked less boyish. He
      held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mary,&rdquo; he cried, eagerly, &ldquo;here I am. Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized both her hands in his. She disengaged them gently. Her manner
      seemed odd to him and he regarded her in a puzzled way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;AREN&rsquo;T you glad?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why, Mary, what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled sadly and shook her head. &ldquo;Oh, Crawford,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why did
      you come? Or, at least, why didn&rsquo;t you write me you were coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;because I was afraid if I did
      you would write me not to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you would. So I took no chances but just came instead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? To see you, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Crawford, please don&rsquo;t joke. You know I asked you not to come here.
      When we last spoke together, over the telephone, I told you that if you
      came here I should not see you. And yet you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His manner changed. He was serious enough now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because&mdash;well, because I felt that I must. I had
      many things to tell you, Mary, and something to ask. And I could neither
      tell nor ask in a letter. Dad and I have quarreled&mdash;we&rsquo;ve parted
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had expected to hear it, but it shocked and grieved her, nevertheless.
      She knew how he had loved his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Crawford,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Sit down and tell me all about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her. There was little more to tell than he had written. His father
      had not become more reconciled to the idea of his marrying Mary. Instead
      his opposition was just as violent and, to his son&rsquo;s mind, as unreasonably
      absurd. Day after day Crawford waited, hoping that time would bring a
      change or that his own arguments might have an effect, but neither time
      nor argument softened Edwin Smith&rsquo;s obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He behaved like a madman at times,&rdquo; declared Crawford. &ldquo;And at others he
      would almost beg me on his knees to give you up. I asked him why. I told
      him over and over again that he should be proud to have such a girl for
      his daughter-in-law. I said everything I could. I told him I would do
      anything for him&mdash;anything he asked&mdash;except give you up. That I
      would not do. And it was the only thing he seemed to wish me to do. Talked
      about bringing shame and disgrace on his head and mine&mdash;and all sorts
      of wild nonsense. When I asked what he meant by disgrace he could not tell
      me. Of course he couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was true, of course he could not tell. Mary knew, and she realized
      once more the tortures which the man must have suffered, must be suffering
      at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So at last we parted,&rdquo; said Crawford. &ldquo;I left word&mdash;left a letter
      saying that, so far as I could see, it was best that I went away. We could
      not agree apparently, he and I, upon the one point which, as I saw it, was
      the most important decision of my life. And I had made that decision. I
      told him how much I hated to leave him; that I loved him as much as I ever
      did. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I shall not give up my happiness and my future merely
      to gratify your unreasonable whim.&rsquo; Then I came away and started East to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, evidently expecting Mary to make some comment or ask a
      question, but she was silent. After a moment he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made any definite plans as yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have another year
      at the Medical School&mdash;or should have it. I am hoping that I may be
      able to go back to the Harvard Med. here in Boston and work my way
      through. Other chaps have done it and I&rsquo;m sure I can. And after that&mdash;well,
      after that I must take my chance at finding a location and a practice,
      like any other young M.D. But first of all, Mary, I want you to tell me
      that you will wait for me. It&rsquo;s a lot to ask; I know how much. But will
      you, Mary dear? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come here for&mdash;to get you to say
      that you will. After that I can face anything&mdash;yes, and win out,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked at him. His face was aglow with earnestness and his voice
      shook as he finished speaking. He rose and held out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, Mary?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him no longer. She was afraid to do so&mdash;afraid of her
      own weakness. But no sign of that weakness showed itself in her tone as
      she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Crawford,&rdquo; she said, gently. &ldquo;I wish I could, but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t! Can&rsquo;t wait for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could wait for you, it isn&rsquo;t that. If it were merely a question of
      waiting&mdash;if that were all&mdash;how easy it would be! But it isn&rsquo;t.
      Crawford, you must go back to your father. You must go back to him and
      forget all about me. You must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her for a moment. Then he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget you!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Mary, are you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, Crawford! Don&rsquo;t make this any harder for both of us than it
      has to be. You must go back to your father and you must forget me. I can
      not marry you, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mary,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Of course I know you can&rsquo;t&mdash;now.
      I know how you feel about your duty to your uncles. I know they need you.
      I am not asking that you leave them. I ask only that you say you will wait
      until&mdash;until by and by, when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Crawford! No, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary! You&mdash;Oh, but you must say it! Don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t love
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. He put his hands upon her shoulders. She could feel them
      tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love me, Mary?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Look up! Look at me! DON&rsquo;T you
      love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look up, but she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Crawford,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Not enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him catch his breath, and she longed&mdash;Oh, how she longed!&mdash;to
      throw her arms about him, tell him that it was all a lie, that she did
      love him. But she forced herself not to think of her own love, only of
      those whom she loved and what disgrace and shame and misery would come
      upon them if she yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not enough?&rdquo; she heard him repeat slowly. &ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t love me?
      Oh, Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Crawford,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how sorry. Please&mdash;please
      don&rsquo;t think hardly of me, not too hardly. I wish&mdash;I wish it were
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for a moment. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand. Is there someone else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! There isn&rsquo;t anyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;But you told me&mdash;You have let me think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! I told you I was not sure of my own feelings. I&mdash;I am sure
      now. I am so sorry you came. I should have written you. I had begun the
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again silence. Then he laughed, a short, bitter laugh with anything but
      mirth in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;WHAT a fool I have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Crawford, don&rsquo;t speak so. . . . Oh, where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I don&rsquo;t know. What difference does it make where I go? Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Crawford! Wait! It makes a difference to your father where you go.
      It makes a difference to me. I&mdash;I value your friendship very highly.
      I hoped I might keep that. I hoped you would let me be your friend, even
      though the other could not be. I hoped that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minute before she had asked him to forget her, but she did not
      remember that, nor did he. He was standing by the door, looking out. For a
      moment he stood there. Then he turned and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Mary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have behaved like a cad, I&rsquo;m afraid. When
      a fellow has been building air castles and all at once they tumble down
      upon his head he&mdash;well, he is likely to forget other things. Forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand. She could keep back the tears no longer; her eyes
      filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing for me to forgive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you will forgive me,
      that is all I ask. And&mdash;and let me still be your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Bless you, Mary! I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t talk any more now. You&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
       with an attempt at a smile&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to give me a little time to
      get my bearings, as your Uncle Shad would say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and won&rsquo;t you go back to your father? I shall feel so much
      happier if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. Then he nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose it is the thing I ought to
      do. Dad will be happy, at any rate. Oh, Mary, CAN&rsquo;T you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Crawford, no. Yes, your father will be happy. And&mdash;and by and by
      you will be, too, I know. Are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I had better. I don&rsquo;t feel like meeting anyone and your
      Uncle Shad will be here soon, I suppose. Your man here&mdash;Isaiah&mdash;told
      me of Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s sickness. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor Uncle Zoeth! He is gaining a little, however. Crawford, I won&rsquo;t
      ask you to stay. Perhaps it will be best for both of us if you do not. But
      won&rsquo;t you write me just once more? Just to tell me that you and your
      father are reconciled? I should like to know that. And do forgive me&mdash;Oh,
      do! I HAD to say it, Crawford!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you, Mary. Of course you had to say it. . . . But . . . Well,
      never mind. Yes, I&rsquo;ll write, of course. I hope . . . No, I can&rsquo;t say that,
      not now. I&rsquo;d better go at once, I think, before I . . . Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand, pressed it tightly, took his hat from the table and
      his bag from the floor and swung out of the door. In the doorway she stood
      looking after him. At the gate he turned, waved his hand, and hurried on.
      He did not look back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at half-past six Captain Shadrach, having left Annabel and the boy in
      charge of the store, came home for supper, Isaiah had some news to tell
      him. It was surprising news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;Well, well, I want to know! All
      the way from out West, eh? Sho! Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the funny part of it, he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Gone where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is he come and said he wanted to see Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&mdash;I
      went up and told her and she come down to see him. I stayed up along of
      Zoeth until Debby T. came back from her shoppin&rsquo; cruise. Then I come
      downstairs again and his hat and bag was gone. There wan&rsquo;t nobody here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was Mary-&rsquo;Gusta? Where is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up in her room, I cal&rsquo;late. I heard her movin&rsquo; round there a spell ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach went up the stairs, along the hall, and knocked at Mary&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked a faint voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your Uncle Shad, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Can I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered. There was no lamp and the room was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, by the window, Uncle Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in the rocker by the window. He could not see her face,
      but as he bent and kissed her cheek he found it wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us! You&rsquo;ve been cryin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Oh, no, I haven&rsquo;t! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! Yes, you have, too. Settin&rsquo; alone up here in the dark and
      cryin&rsquo;! Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop, come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen from the rocking-chair, but he seized her in his arms, sat
      down in the chair himself, and lifted her to his knee just as he used to
      do when she was the little Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there, dearie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell your Uncle Shad. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, Uncle Shad, dear. I was&mdash;I&rsquo;m feeling just a little
      silly this afternoon, I guess. You mustn&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t ask&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell. That young feller from out West,
      the feller with the uncommon name&mdash;Brown&mdash;Jones&mdash;Oh, no,
      Smith, that was it&mdash;he came cruisin&rsquo; around here and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad, how did you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bird told me. A long-legged bird without much hair on top&mdash;a
      bald-headed eagle, I cal&rsquo;late he must be. Hops round our kitchen daytimes
      and roosts in the attic nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaiah! Of course he would tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would&mdash;BEIN&rsquo; Isaiah. Well, this Smith critter, he came
      and&mdash;and&mdash;well, I guess you&rsquo;ll have to tell me the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell. He came and&mdash;and then he went away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went away&mdash;where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out to Carson City, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he comin&rsquo; back any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Don&rsquo;t you want him to come, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Shad, please don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t feel as if I could answer. Don&rsquo;t
      ask me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, dearie; don&rsquo;t you answer nothin&rsquo;. You set still here and be
      my baby. I ain&rsquo;t had a chance to baby you for a long spell and it seems
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence. Suddenly the Captain felt the head which nestled against his
      shoulder stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shadrach,&rdquo; said Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, &ldquo;what do you do when you want to
      forget?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Want to forget? Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! Cal&rsquo;late I turn to and sail in and
      work a little harder, maybe. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. . . But I am much obliged for the suggestion. Now I am going
      to work. I shall begin tomorrow morning. I wish it was tomorrow right
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. Jumpin&rsquo; fire! Don&rsquo;t wish time away; some of us ain&rsquo;t got too much
      to spare. But ain&rsquo;t you BEEN workin&rsquo;, for mercy sakes? I should say you
      had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another interval of silence. Then Mary said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad, a good while ago, when you asked me about&mdash;about him, I
      promised you I would tell when there was anything to tell. I am going to
      keep my promise. He came today and asked me&mdash;asked me to marry him&mdash;not
      now, of course, but by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was not greatly surprised. Nevertheless it was a moment before he
      spoke. Mary felt his arms tighten about her and she realized a little of
      the struggle he was making. Yet his tone was brave and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I kind of cal&rsquo;lated that would come some
      day or other. It&rsquo;s all right, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Zoeth and me have talked it
      over and all we want is to see you happy. If you said yes to him, Zoeth
      and I&rsquo;ll say &lsquo;God bless you&rsquo; to both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached for his hand and lifted it to her lips. &ldquo;I know you would,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;All your lives you have been thinking of others and not of
      yourselves. But I didn&rsquo;t say yes, Uncle Shad. I am not going to be married
      now or by and by. I don&rsquo;t want to be. I am the silent partner of Hamilton
      and Company. I am a business woman and I am going to work&mdash;REALLY
      work&mdash;from now on. No, you mustn&rsquo;t ask me any more questions. We&rsquo;ll
      try to forget it all. Kiss me, Uncle Shad, dear. That&rsquo;s it. Now you go
      down to supper. I shall stay here; I am not hungry tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Shad did ask more questions, of course. He asked no more that
      evening&mdash;he judged it wisest not to do so; but the next day, seizing
      an opportunity when he and his niece were alone, he endeavored to learn a
      little more concerning her reasons for dismissing Crawford. The Captain
      liked young Smith, he had believed Mary liked him very much, and, although
      he could not help feeling a guilty sense of relief because the danger that
      he and Zoeth might have to share her affections with someone else was, for
      the time at least, out of the way, he was puzzled and troubled by the
      abruptness of the dismissal. There was something, he felt sure, which he
      did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t askin&rsquo; anything&mdash;that is,
      I don&rsquo;t mean to put my oar in about what you told me last night, but&mdash;well,
      you see, Zoeth and me was beginnin&rsquo; to feel that &lsquo;twas pretty nigh a
      settled thing between you and that young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary was sitting at the desk&mdash;she and her uncle were at the store
      together&mdash;and she looked up from the ledger over which she had been
      bending and shook her head reproachfully. She looked tired and worn, so it
      seemed to Captain Shadrach, as if she had not slept well the night before,
      or perhaps for several nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Why, you told me&mdash;You know what you told me, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. What
      do you ask that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I think you have forgotten the most important part of it. I told
      you we were going to forget it all. And we are. We are not going to speak
      of it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do just tell me this much; if you don&rsquo;t I shan&rsquo;t rest in peace: you
      didn&rsquo;t send him away on account of Zoeth and me? It wan&rsquo;t just because you
      thought we needed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Uncle Shad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s over with; it&rsquo;s done with forever. If you really care
      about me, Uncle Shad&mdash;and sometimes, you know, I almost suspect that
      you really do&mdash;you will never, NEVER say another word about it. Now
      come here and tell me about this account of Heman Rodger&rsquo;s. Isn&rsquo;t it time
      we tried to get a payment from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, although still uneasy and far from satisfied, asked no more
      questions of his niece. It was evident that nothing was to be gained in
      that way. He did, however, question Isaiah to learn if the latter had
      noticed anything unusual in Crawford&rsquo;s manner or if Crawford had said
      anything concerning his reason for coming on at that time, but Isaiah had
      noticed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; grunted Shadrach, rather impatiently, for the mystery in the
      affair irritated him. &ldquo;Of course, you didn&rsquo;t notice. YOU wouldn&rsquo;t notice
      if your head came off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase drew himself up. &ldquo;If I hove out such a statement as that,&rdquo; he
      observed, scornfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d call me a fool. &lsquo;If my head come off!&rsquo; How
      could I notice anything if my head was off? You tell me that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His employer grinned. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you could do it about as well as you can
      with it on, Isaiah,&rdquo; he said, and walked away, leaving the cook and
      steward incoherently anxious to retort but lacking ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Shadrach was obliged to give up the riddle. Lovers&rsquo; quarrels were by no
      means unusual, he knew that, and many young love affairs came to nothing.
      Mary had never told him that she cared for Crawford. But she had never
      said she did not care for him. And now she would say nothing except that
      it was &ldquo;done with forever.&rdquo; The Captain shook his head and longed for
      Zoeth&rsquo;s counsel and advice. But Zoeth would not be able to counsel or
      advise for months.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Mary seemed bent upon proving the truth of her statement that she
      was henceforth to be solely a business woman. The summer being over&mdash;and
      it had been, everything considered, a successful one for Hamilton and
      Company&mdash;it became time to buy fall and winter goods, also goods for
      the holidays. Mary went to Boston on a buying expedition. When she
      returned and informed her uncle what and how much she had bought, he
      looked almost as if he had been listening to the reading of his death
      warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; Judas!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you bought all
      them things and&mdash;and got TRUSTED for &lsquo;em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did, Uncle Shad. It is the only way I could buy them; and, so
      far as that goes, everyone was glad to sell me. You see, our paying our
      bills up there in a shorter time than I asked for has made a very good
      impression. I could have bought ever and ever so much more if I had
      thought it best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire! Well, I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t think it best. What in the nation
      we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do with all we have got I don&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do with it? Why, sell it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Urn&mdash;yes, I cal&rsquo;lated that was the idea, probably; but who&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; 
      to buy it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lots of people. You&rsquo;ll see. I am going to advertise this fall,
      advertise in the papers. Oh, we&rsquo;ll make Baker&rsquo;s Bazaar and the rest worry
      a little before we&rsquo;re through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain was inclined to fear that the most of the worrying would be
      done by Hamilton and Company, but he expressed no more misgivings.
      Besides, if anyone could sell all those goods, that one was his
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, he was perfectly sure of that. He believed her quite capable
      of performing almost any miracle. Had she not pulled the firm off the
      rocks where he and his partner had almost wrecked it? Wasn&rsquo;t she the most
      wonderful young woman on earth? Old as he was, Captain Shad would probably
      have attempted to thrash any person who expressed a doubt of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the goods were sold, all of them and more. The advertisements,
      temptingly worded, appeared in the county weeklies, and circulars were
      sent through the mails. Partly by enterprise and partly through influence&mdash;Mr.
      Keith helped here&mdash;Mary attained for Hamilton and Company the
      contract for supplying the furniture and draperies for the new hotel which
      a New York syndicate was building at Orham Neck. It was purely a
      commission deal, of course&mdash;everything was purchased in Boston&mdash;and
      Hamilton and Company&rsquo;s profit was a percentage, but even a small
      percentage on so large a sale made a respectable figure on a check and
      helped to pay more of the firm&rsquo;s debts. And those debts, the old ones,
      were now reduced to an almost negligible quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secondhand horse and wagon still continued to go upon their rounds,
      but the boy had been replaced by an active young fellow whose name was
      Crocker and who was capable of taking orders as well as delivering them.
      When Captain Shadrach was told&mdash;not consulted concerning but told&mdash;the
      wages this young man was to receive, he was, as he confided to Isaiah
      afterward, &ldquo;dismasted, stove in, down by the head and sinkin&rsquo; fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop!&rdquo; he cried, in amazement. &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; stark loony?
      Payin&rsquo; that Simmie Crocker fourteen dollars a WEEK for drivin&rsquo; team and
      swappin&rsquo; our good sugar and flour for sewin&rsquo;-circle lies over folks&rsquo; back
      fences! I never heard such a thing in my life. Why, Baker&rsquo;s Bazaar don&rsquo;t
      pay the man on their team but ten a week. I know that &lsquo;cause he told me so
      himself. And Baker&rsquo;s Bazaar&rsquo;s got more trade than we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And that is exactly why we need a better man than they have, so that
      WE can get more trade. Simeon Crocker is an ambitious young chap. He isn&rsquo;t
      going to be contented with fourteen long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he ain&rsquo;t, eh? Well, I ain&rsquo;t contented with it now, I tell you that.
      Fourteen dollars a week for drivin&rsquo; cart! Jumpin&rsquo; fire! Why, the cart
      itself ain&rsquo;t worth more&rsquo;n fifteen and for twenty-five I&rsquo;d heave in the
      horse for good measure. But I&rsquo;d never get the chance,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;unless I
      could make the trade in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed and patted his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, confidently, &ldquo;Sim Crocker at fourteen
      a week is a good investment. He will get us a lot of new business now, and
      next summer&mdash;well, I have some plans of my own for next summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Christmas business was very good indeed. Shadrach, Mary, Annabel, and
      Simeon were kept busy. Customers came, not only from South Harniss, but
      from West and East Harniss and even from Orham and Bayport. The newspaper
      advertisements were responsible for this in the beginning, but those who
      first came told others that the best stock of Christmas goods in Ostable
      County was to be found at the store of Hamilton and Company, in South
      Harniss, and so the indirect, word-of-mouth advertising, which is the best
      and most convincing kind, spread and brought results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas itself was a rather dreary day. Zoeth, although improving, was
      not yet strong enough to leave his room, and so the Christmas dinner
      lacked his presence at the table. Mary and Shadrach sat with him for an
      hour or so, but the doctor and nurse had cautioned them against exciting
      him, so, although the Captain joked continually, his jokes were rather
      fickle and in his mind was his partner&rsquo;s prophecy of two years before&mdash;that
      the tide which had, up to that time, been coming in for them, would soon
      begin to go out. Shadrach could not help feeling that it had been going
      out, for poor Zoeth at any rate. The doctor declared it was coming in
      again, but how slowly it came! And how far would it come? This was the
      first Christmas dinner he had eaten in years without seeing Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s
      kindly, patient face at the other side of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mary, although she tried to appear gay and lighthearted, laughing at
      her uncle&rsquo;s jokes and attempting a few of her own, was far from happy.
      Work, Captain Shad&rsquo;s recipe for producing forgetfulness, had helped, but
      it had not cured. And when, as on a holiday like this, or at night after
      she had gone to bed, there was no work to occupy her mind, she remembered
      only too well. Crawford had written her, as he promised, after his return
      home. He wrote that he and his father were reconciled and that he had
      resumed his studies. The letter was brave and cheerful, there was not a
      hint of whining or complaint in it. Mary was proud of him, proud of his
      courage and self-restraint. She could read between the lines and the
      loneliness and hopelessness were there but he had done his best to conceal
      them for her sake. If he felt resentment toward her, he did not show it.
      Lonely and hopeless as she herself was, her heart went out to him, but she
      did not repent her decision. It was better, ever and ever so much better,
      as it was. He would forget and be happy by and by, and would never know
      his father&rsquo;s shameful story. And poor Uncle Zoeth would never know,
      either. As for her&mdash;well, she must work, work harder than ever. Thank
      God there were six working days in the week!
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer that letter. After much deliberation she fought down
      the temptation and decided not to do so. What was the use? If one wished
      to forget, or wished someone else to forget, if it was a real wish and not
      merely pretending, the way to bring about that result was to do nothing to
      cause remembrance. Letters, even the letters of friends, the most platonic
      letters, were reminders. She had begged for Crawford&rsquo;s friendship&mdash;she
      could not bring herself to let him go without hearing that he forgave her
      and would think of her as a friend&mdash;but now she vowed she would not
      be so silly and childish as to torture him or herself unnecessarily. She
      would not do it. And so she did not write.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Christmas came the long, dull winter. It was the most discouraging
      season the silent partner of Hamilton and Company had yet put in in her
      capacity as manager. There were no cottagers to help out with their
      custom, very few new customers, no fresh faces in the store, the same
      dreary, deadly round from morning till night. She tried her hardest and,
      with the able assistance of Sim Crocker who was proving himself a
      treasure, did succeed in making February&rsquo;s sales larger than January&rsquo;s and
      those of March larger than either. But she looked forward to April and the
      real spring with impatience. She had a plan for the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in March that she experienced a great satisfaction and gave
      Shadrach the surprise and delight of his life by collecting the firm&rsquo;s
      bill against Mr. Jeremiah Clifford. Mr. Clifford, it will be remembered,
      had owed Hamilton and Company one hundred and ten dollars for a long time.
      There was every indication that he was perfectly satisfied with the
      arrangement and intended to owe it forever. Mary had written, had called
      upon him repeatedly, had even journeyed to Ostable and consulted her
      friend Judge Baxter. The Judge had promised to look into the matter and he
      did so, but his letter to her contained little that was hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is money there [wrote the Judge]. The man Clifford appears to be in
      very comfortable circumstances, but he is a shrewd [there were indications
      here that the word &ldquo;rascal&rdquo; had been written and then erased] person and,
      so far as I can learn, there is not a single item of property, real or
      otherwise, that is in his own name. If there were, we might attach that
      property for your debt, but we cannot attach Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s holdings. All
      I can advise is to discontinue selling him more goods and to worry him all
      you can about the old bill. He may grow tired of being dunned and pay, if
      not all, at least something on account.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mary read this portion of the letter to her Uncle Shadrach his scorn
      was outspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get tired!&rdquo; he scoffed. &ldquo;Jerry Clifford get tired of bein&rsquo; dunned! DON&rsquo;T
      talk so foolish! Why, he gets fat on that kind of thing; it&rsquo;s the main
      excitement he has, that and spendin&rsquo; a cent twice a day for newspapers.
      Did you ever watch Jerry buy a paper? No? Well, you go up to Ellis&rsquo;s some
      day when the mornin&rsquo; papers are put out for sale and watch him. He&rsquo;ll
      drive up to the door with that old hoopskirt of a horse of his&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what the critter looks like, one of them old-fashioned hoop-skirts; there
      was nothin&rsquo; to them but framework and a hollow inside, and that&rsquo;s all
      there is to that horse.&mdash;Well, Jerry he&rsquo;ll drive up and come in to
      the paper counter, his eyes shinin&rsquo; and his nerves all keyed up and one
      hand shoved down into his britches pocket. He&rsquo;ll stand and look over the
      papers on the counter, readin&rsquo; as much of every one as he can for nothin&rsquo;,
      and then by and by that hand&rsquo;ll come out of his pocket with a cent in it.
      Then the other hand&rsquo;ll reach over and get hold of the paper he&rsquo;s
      cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to buy, get a good clove hitch onto it, and then for a minute
      he&rsquo;ll stand there lookin&rsquo; first at the cent and then at the paper and
      rubbin&rsquo; the money between his finger and thumb&mdash;he&rsquo;s figgerin&rsquo; to
      have a little of the copper smell left on his hand even if he has to let
      go of the coin, you see&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;what ridiculous nonsense you do talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense about it. It&rsquo;s dead serious. It ain&rsquo;t any joke to Jerry, you
      can bet on that. Well, after a spell, he kind of gets his spunk up to make
      the plunge, as you might say, lays down the penny&mdash;Oh, he never
      throws it down; he wouldn&rsquo;t treat real money as disrespectful as that&mdash;grabs
      up the paper and makes a break for outdoors, never once lookin&rsquo; back for
      fear he might change his mind. When he drives off in his buggy you can see
      that he&rsquo;s all het up and trembly, like one of them reckless Wall Street
      speculators you read about. He&rsquo;s spent a cent, but he&rsquo;s had a lovely
      nerve-wrackin&rsquo; time doin&rsquo; it. Oh, a feller has to satisfy his cravin&rsquo; for
      excitement somehow, and Jerry satisfies his buyin&rsquo; one-cent newspapers and
      seein&rsquo; his creditors get mad. Do you suppose you can worry such a critter
      as that by talkin&rsquo; to him about what he owes? Might as well try to worry a
      codfish by leanin&rsquo; over the rail of the boat and hollerin&rsquo; to it that it&rsquo;s
      drownin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you may be right, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;but I shan&rsquo;t give up hope. My chance may come some day, if I wait and
      watch for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It came unexpectedly and in a rather odd manner. One raw, windy March
      afternoon she was very much surprised to see Sam Keith walk into the
      store. Sam, since his graduation from college, was, as he expressed it,
      &ldquo;moaning on the bar&rdquo; in Boston&mdash;that is to say, he was attending the
      Harvard Law School with the hope, on his parents&rsquo; part, that he might
      ultimately become a lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary. &ldquo;Is this you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam grinned cheerfully. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis I,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I am here. That is to say,
      the handsome youth whose footfalls you hear approaching upon horseback is
      none other than our hero. Mary, you are, as usual, a sight to be thankful
      for. How do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary admitted that she was in good health and then demanded to know what
      he was doing down on the Cape at that time of the year. He sat down in a
      chair by the stove and propped his feet against the hearth before
      replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Haven&rsquo;t you guessed?&rdquo; he asked, in mock amazement. &ldquo;Dear me! I&rsquo;m
      surprised. I should have thought the weather would have suggested my
      errand. Hear that zephyr; doesn&rsquo;t it suggest bathing suits and outing
      flannels and mosquitoes and hammock flirtations? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The zephyr was a sixty-mile-an-hour March gale. Sam replied to his own
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it does not. Right, my child; go up head. But, honest
      Injun, I am down here on summer business. That Mr. Raymond, Dad&rsquo;s friend,
      who was visiting us this summer is crazy about the Cape. He has decided to
      build a summer home here at South Harniss, and the first requisite being
      land to build it on he has asked Dad to buy the strip between our own
      property and the North Inlet, always provided it can be bought. Dad asked
      me to come down here and see about it, so here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary considered. &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, after a moment, &ldquo;I know the land you
      mean. Who owns it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;But I do know now. I asked the
      first person I met after I got off the train and oddly enough he turned
      out to be the owner himself. It was old Clifford&mdash;Isaiah, Elisha,
      Hosea&mdash;Jeremiah, that&rsquo;s it. I knew it was one of the prophets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Clifford owns that land. I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I. He didn&rsquo;t tell me at first that he did own it. Asked me
      what I wanted to know for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell him?&rdquo; asked Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since Mr. Keith&rsquo;s arrival that young gentleman&rsquo;s easy
      assurance seemed a little shaken. He appeared to feel rather foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, to be honest, I did,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I was an idiot, I suppose,
      but everyone asks about everyone&rsquo;s else business down here and I didn&rsquo;t
      think. He kept talking and pumping and before I realized it I told him
      about Raymond&rsquo;s being so anxious to get that property, being dead set on
      it and all that, and about my being commissioned to buy at any reasonable
      figure. And then, after a while, he astonished me by saying he owned the
      land himself. Confound it! I suppose he&rsquo;ll jam the price away up after
      what I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then you haven&rsquo;t bought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I was willing, but for some reason he wouldn&rsquo;t sell at once&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      even talk price. Wanted to think it over, he said. I can&rsquo;t wait now, but I
      am coming down again on Monday and we shall close the deal then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Mary told Shadrach what Sam had said. The Captain looked
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Jerry Clifford owned that land,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
      he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he does, Uncle Shad. He wouldn&rsquo;t have told Sam he did own it if
      he didn&rsquo;t. What in the world would he gain by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothin&rsquo;, I presume likely. But he must have bought it mighty recent.
      Last I heard Jimmie G. owned that piece. &lsquo;Twas part of the property his
      father left him. Next time I see Jimmie I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, three days later, when Jimmie G.&mdash;his last name was Peters&mdash;passed
      the store the Captain hailed him and, inviting him in, went straight to
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you sell Jerry Clifford that North Inlet land of yours, Jim?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie G. looked surprised. &ldquo;How in time did you know I had sold it?&rdquo; he
      demanded. &ldquo;It beats all how things get around in this town. I never sold
      that land until day afore yesterday evenin&rsquo; and the deed didn&rsquo;t pass till
      yesterday, and yet you know the whole business. Not that I care; &lsquo;twas
      Jerry wanted it kept still. Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad whistled. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I see. Yes, yes. When
      Jerry told Sam he owned that land he . . . Humph! It&rsquo;s just another case
      of the boy lied, that&rsquo;s all. Tut, tut, tut! When you get ahead of Jerry
      Clifford you&rsquo;ve got to turn out early, ain&rsquo;t you? I hope you got a good
      price for the land, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t; that is, not very big. What&rsquo;s up, anyway? What are you
      hintin&rsquo; at, Cap&rsquo;n Shad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the Captain could answer, Mary, who had been listening to the
      conversation, broke in to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Peters,&rdquo; she cried eagerly, &ldquo;would you mind telling me this: Whose
      name is the new deed in, Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s or his wife&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie G. laughed. &ldquo;Why, that was kind of funny, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know
      Jerry, Cap&rsquo;n Shad; he never has nothin&rsquo; in his own name&mdash;it&rsquo;s all in
      his wife&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s a principle of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it a lack of principle,&rdquo; grunted Shadrach. &ldquo;Never mind, Jim; go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was in a terrible rush to close the sale, for some reason or
      other,&rdquo; went on Peters, &ldquo;and I forgot, myself, and had the deed made in
      the name of Jeremiah Clifford. He made a big row at first, but it seemed
      as if he couldn&rsquo;t wait for me to have it changed, so he handed over his
      check and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Wait, please, Mr. Peters!&rdquo; broke in Mary, her eyes flashing with
      excitement. &ldquo;Just tell me if I understand you correctly. You sold that
      land to Mr. Clifford and he owns it now IN HIS OWN NAME?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;sartin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary waited to hear no more. She ran out of the store and to the
      post-office. A few minutes later she was talking with Judge Baxter over
      the telephone. When she returned the Captain was curious to know where she
      had been, but she would not tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wait, Uncle Shad; I think something is going to
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It happened on Monday morning. Mary was at the desk; Simeon was in the
      back room getting ready his early morning orders, and Captain Shad was
      standing by the window looking out. Suddenly Mary heard him utter an
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke as if you were in pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder. I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; at somethin&rsquo; that gives me a pain. That wizened-up
      landshark of a Jerry Clifford is in sight, bound to the post-office, I
      cal&rsquo;late. Goin&rsquo; to put a one-cent stamp on a letter and let the feller
      that gets it pay the other cent, I suppose. He always asks the postmaster
      to lick the stamp, so&rsquo;s to save the wear and tear on his own tongue.
      That&rsquo;s a fact. . . . No,&rdquo; he added, a moment later, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to the
      office; he&rsquo;s turnin&rsquo; down the lane here. . . . Eh! Jumpin&rsquo; fire of
      brimstone, I do believe&mdash;WHAT in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s step was upon the platform of the store and in another
      moment the door opened and the tight-fisted one himself appeared. Shadrach
      said nothing; he could only stare in amazement. It had been more than two
      years since Jeremiah had crossed that threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he crossed it now. And, after a look about the place, ignoring the
      Captain completely, he walked over to the desk. He did not look happy.
      Mary, on the contrary, looked very much pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Clifford,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah, who was a little thin man, looked up at her from under his heavy
      gray eyebrows and above his spectacles. He did not acknowledge the
      salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; he grunted savagely. &ldquo;You think you&rsquo;re smart, don&rsquo;t ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach started forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&mdash;&rdquo; he began. Mary held up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interfere, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;This is Mr. Clifford&rsquo;s affair
      and mine. We understand each other perfectly.&rdquo; Then, turning to the
      frowning Jeremiah, she said: &ldquo;Why, yes, thank you, Mr. Clifford, I do
      think I am rather clever&mdash;just now. Don&rsquo;t you think I am, yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the visitor ignored the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you go and stick an attachment on that land of mine for?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t need to ask me that, Mr. Clifford. The amount is one
      hundred and ten dollars and sixty-three cents. I remember it and I should
      imagine you must; certainly it has been called to your attention often
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! Well, you can keep your darned old attachment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; and you can keep your land&mdash;what is left, I mean. I think
      you will keep it for some time&mdash;after I tell Mr. Keith the facts. He
      will be here this afternoon, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that Jeremiah was quite aware of the time of Sam Keith&rsquo;s
      arrival. His teeth&mdash;the few remaining&mdash;snapped together and, as
      Captain Shadrach said afterwards, he looked as if undecided whether to
      bite or put back his head and howl. Apparently he decided that howling was
      safer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to pay that bill of yours, anyhow,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, and we were calculating that you would,&rdquo; said Mary sweetly.
      &ldquo;Your calculations and ours are proving true, Mr. Clifford. That&rsquo;s nice,
      isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the direction of the back room, where Simeon was busy with his
      orders, came the sound of a smothered laugh. Shadrach, upon whom
      understanding of the situation was just beginning to dawn, slapped his
      knee. Mr. Clifford looked positively venomous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I pay that bill&mdash;that&mdash;what was it?&mdash;that hundred and
      ten dollars you say I owe you&mdash;do I get that attachment off my land
      right away?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you pay the one hundred and ten dollars&mdash;and the sixty-three
      cents&mdash;I shall phone Judge Baxter the next minute,&rdquo; said Mary
      promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah hesitated no longer. He had considered the situation in all its
      phases before leaving home and the one hundred and ten dollars was but a
      small item compared to his expected profit on the sale of the North Inlet
      land. He reached into his pocket, produced a long, dingy leather
      pocketbook wound about with twine, unwound the twine, opened the
      pocketbook and produced a blank check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a pen and ink,&rdquo; he snarled, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll fill this in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain reached for the pen and ink bottle, but Mary interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cash, if you please,&rdquo; she said sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah looked at her steadily for what seemed a long time. Then she was
      surprised to see the corner of his lip twitch and notice a grim twinkle in
      his eye. Also there was a grudging note of admiration in his voice when he
      next spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo; no chances, be you?&rdquo; he said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve taken enough already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford did not answer. He replaced the blank check in his pocketbook
      and, from another compartment, extracted some bills rolled in a tight
      little cylinder and wound about with elastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you be,&rdquo; he said shortly. Then, turning to Shadrach, he added:
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I get nothin&rsquo; off for payin&rsquo; cash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the back room came a vigorous &ldquo;Haw, haw!&rdquo; Even Mary laughed aloud. As
      for Captain Shad, he could only stare, struck speechless by his visitor&rsquo;s
      audacity. Mary, when she had finished laughing, answered for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall deduct the interest we might have charged you, Mr. Clifford,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;Thank you. There is your change and there is the receipted
      bill. Now, I shall call up Judge Baxter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she returned from the post-office Jeremiah was still there. Shadrach,
      all smiles, was doing up parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are those, Uncle Shad?&rdquo; asked Mary. Mr. Clifford answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I thought I might as well buy a little sugar and flour and such,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Always come in handy, they do. Send &lsquo;em up when you get to it.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand was on the door, but Mary called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clifford,&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;just a minute, please. Are you in any hurry
      for these things&mdash;the sugar and the rest of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I be, &lsquo;special&rsquo;; why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing, except that if you were in a hurry I should advise your
      paying for them. I told you, you remember, that we weren&rsquo;t taking
      chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Jeremiah stood there glowering. Then he did another
      astonishing thing. He took out the pocketbook once more and from it
      extracted a two-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it out of that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and send me a receipted bill afterwards.
      I always cal&rsquo;late to know what I&rsquo;ve paid for. And say, you&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      your name&mdash;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, if you get tired of workin&rsquo; for Shad Gould
      and Zoeth Hamilton, come round and see me. I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;I mean my wife&rsquo;s
      got&mdash;two or three mortgages that&rsquo;s behind on the interest. I ain&rsquo;t
      been able to collect it for her yet, but&mdash;but, by time, I believe YOU
      could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out and the next moment Mary was almost smothered in her uncle&rsquo;s
      embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this&mdash;after THIS,&rdquo; roared Shadrach, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe anything&rsquo;s
      possible if you&rsquo;ve got a hand in it, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. If YOU&rsquo;D been Jonah
      you&rsquo;d have put the whale in your pocket and swum ashore.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Early in April, when Mary announced that she was ready to put into
      operation her biggest and most ambitious plan, suggested the year before
      by Barbara Howe&mdash;the tea-room and gift-shop plan&mdash;the Captain
      did not offer strenuous opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much sense in it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I know what
      it&rsquo;s all about. Nigh as I can make out you&rsquo;re figgerin&rsquo; to open up some
      kind of a high-toned eatin&rsquo; house. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, Uncle Shad, not exactly,&rdquo; explained Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it&mdash;a drinkin&rsquo; house? I presume likely that&rsquo;s it, bein&rsquo; 
      as you call it a &lsquo;tea-room.&rsquo; Kind of a temperance saloon, eh? Can&rsquo;t a
      feller get coffee in it, if he wants to? I don&rsquo;t wake up nights much
      hankerin&rsquo; for tea myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Uncle Shad: A tea-room&mdash;at least a tearoom of the sort I
      intend to have&mdash;is a place where the summer people, the women and
      girls especially, will come and sit at little tables and drink tea and eat
      cakes and ice cream and look off at the ocean, if the weather is pleasant&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and at the fog, if &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t; and talk about their neighbor&rsquo;s clothes
      and run down the characters of their best friends. Yes, yes, I see; sort
      of a sewin&rsquo; circle without the sewin&rsquo;. All right, heave ahead and get your
      tea-room off the ways if you want to. If anybody can make the thing keep
      afloat you can, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mary, thus encouraged, went on to put her scheme into effect. She had
      been planning the details for some time. About halfway down the lane
      leading to the house from the store was another small story-and-a-half
      dwelling of the old-fashioned Cape Cod type. It stood upon a little hill
      and commanded a wide view of ocean and beach and village. There were some
      weather-beaten trees and a tangle of shrubs about it. It had been
      untenanted for a good while and was in rather bad repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary arranged with the owner, a Bayport man, to lease this house and land
      at a small rental for three years. In the lease was included consent to
      the making of necessary alterations and repairs and the privilege of
      purchasing, at a price therein named, at the end of the three years,
      should the tenant wish to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with the aid of soap and water, white paint and whitewash, attractive
      but inexpensive wall papers, and odds and ends of quaint old furniture, of
      which the parlor and best bedroom of the Gould-Hamilton home supplied the
      larger quantity, she proceeded to make over the interior of the little
      building. To every bit of nautical bric-a-brac, pictures of old sailing
      ships and sea curios she gave especial prominence. Then the lawn was
      mowed, the tangled shrubbery untangled and clipped and pruned; cheap but
      pretty lattices made to look like the shrouds of a ship, over which
      climbing roses were supposed&mdash;some day&mdash;to twine, were placed
      against the walls, and rustic tables set about under the trees and the
      grape arbor with ship lanterns hung above them. The driveway down to the
      lane was rolled and hardened, and a sign, painted by Joshua Bemis, the
      local &ldquo;House, Boat and Sign Painter, Tinsmith and Glazier&rdquo;&mdash;see Mr.
      Bemis&rsquo;s advertisement in the Advocate&mdash;was hung on a frame by the
      gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Shad&rsquo;s remarks when he first saw that sign may be worth quoting.
      Mary had not consulted him concerning it; she deemed it best not to do so.
      When it was in place, however, she led him out to inspect. Shadrach
      adjusted his spectacles and read as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     THE FOR&rsquo;ARD LOOKOUT
        TEA AND GIFTS
     DAINTY THINGS TO EAT
     PRETTY THINGS TO BUY
         ALL&rsquo;S WELL!
</pre>
    <p>
      There was the picture of a full-rigged ship, with every stitch set alow
      and aloft, sailing through a sea of thick green and white paint toward a
      kind of green wall with green feather dusters growing out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach subjected this work of art to a long and searching stare. At last
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carryin&rsquo; every rag she can h&rsquo;ist,&rdquo; he observed; &ldquo;nobody at the wheel,
      land dead ahead and breakers under the bows. Looks to me as if &lsquo;twas
      liable to be a short v&rsquo;yage and a lively one. But the for&rsquo;ard lookout says
      all&rsquo;s well and he ought to know; he&rsquo;s had more experience aboard gift-shop
      ships, I presume likely, than I have. What&rsquo;s those bristly things stickin&rsquo; 
      up along shore there&mdash;eel grass or tea grounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first few weeks after the tea-room was really &ldquo;off the ways&rdquo; the
      optimistic declaration of the For&rsquo;ard Lookout seemed scarcely warranted by
      the facts. Mary was inclined to think that all was by no means well. In
      fitting out the new venture she had been as economical as she dared, but
      she had been obliged to spend money and to take on a fresh assortment of
      debts. Then, too, she had engaged the services of a good cook and two
      waitresses, so there was a weekly expense bill to consider. And the number
      of motor cars which turned in at the new driveway was disappointingly
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the number grew larger. As people had talked about Hamilton and
      Company&rsquo;s assortment of Christmas goods, so now they began to talk about
      the &ldquo;quaintness and delightful originality&rdquo; of the For&rsquo;ard Lookout. The
      tea was good; the cakes and ices were good; on pleasant days the view was
      remarkably fine, and the pretty things in the gift shop were temptingly
      displayed. So, as May passed and June came, and the cottages and hotels
      began to open, the business of the new tea-room and gift shop grew from
      fair to good and from that to very good indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary divided her time between the store and the tearoom, doing her best to
      keep a supervising eye on each. She was in no mood to meet people and kept
      out of the way of strangers as much as possible; even of her former
      acquaintances who came to the For&rsquo;ard Lookout she saw but few. If she had
      not been too busy she might have found it amusing, the contrasting studies
      in human nature afforded by these former acquaintances in their attitude
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, Mr. and Mrs. Christopher Mullet and daughter, Irene, the
      latter now through school and &ldquo;finished&rdquo; until her veneering actually
      glittered, sat drinking tea at a table on the lawn. Said Mrs. Mullet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And THIS is what it&rsquo;s come to; after all the airs and frills and the
      goin&rsquo; to Europe and I don&rsquo;t know what all. Here she is keepin&rsquo; an eatin&rsquo; 
      house. An eatin&rsquo; house&mdash;just THINK of it! If that ain&rsquo;t a comedown!
      Wouldn&rsquo;t you think she&rsquo;d be ashamed, &lsquo;Rena?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Mullet drooped a weary eyelid and sighed a hopeless sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mother,&rdquo; she drawled, in deep disgust, &ldquo;CAN&rsquo;T you stop calling me by
      that outlandish name? I was christened Irene, I believe. PLEASE remember
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, &lsquo;Re&mdash;all right, Irene; I won&rsquo;t forget again. Oh, there&rsquo;s
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, now! Showin&rsquo; herself out here with all these city folks, when
      she&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but a hired help&mdash;a table girl, as you might say! I
      shan&rsquo;t notice her, anyway. I may buy her tea and stuff, but I&mdash;Who&rsquo;s
      that runnin&rsquo; up to her and&mdash;and kissin&rsquo; her&mdash;and&mdash;mercy on
      us! You&rsquo;d think they was sisters, if you didn&rsquo;t know. Who is it? Looks
      kind of common, she does to me. Don&rsquo;t you think so, &lsquo;Rena&mdash;Irene, I
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Irene sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she said with cutting emphasis, &ldquo;is Barbara Howe. Her people are
      building that big summer house at Osterville and her father is a
      millionaire, so they say. And her people wouldn&rsquo;t let her come to the
      school you sent me to because they thought it wasn&rsquo;t good enough for her.
      That&rsquo;s how common SHE is. I met her once, but she doesn&rsquo;t know me now,
      although she is perfectly crazy over that Mary Lathrop. I&mdash;Oh,
      there&rsquo;s Father drinking out of his saucer again! For heaven&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s
      go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just then Barbara was enthusiastically hugging her former schoolmate
      and exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did it! I knew you would if you would only try. I said it required a
      knack or a genius or something and that I was certain you had it. It&rsquo;s the
      dearest place of the kind I&rsquo;ve ever seen, my dear, and if every single
      person I know who is in this vicinity doesn&rsquo;t come here at least once a
      week and spend lots and lots of money I&rsquo;ll never speak to them again. I&rsquo;m
      going to turn myself into a walking phonograph, my dear, with just one
      record: &lsquo;If you love me visit the For&rsquo;ard Lookout.&rsquo; And of course everyone
      loves me&mdash;how can they help it? So&mdash;well, just wait and see what
      happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So far as spreading abroad the praises of the new tea-room was concerned,
      she was as good as her word. In August the patronage was so great and
      continuous that Mary found it necessary to hire three more waitresses and
      a salesgirl for the gift shop. She spent more of her own time there,
      leaving the care of the store to Shadrach, Simeon Crocker and a new clerk,
      who had been hired to help with the summer custom. When early September
      brought the beginning of the season&rsquo;s end the books of both the Lookout
      and of Hamilton and Company showed a substantial profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all this was going on Zoeth was steadily gaining in health and
      strength. In July he was sitting in the sunshine upon the front porch. In
      August he was able to climb to the buggy seat and be driven up to the
      store, where day after day he sat in his armchair behind the counter,
      watching what was going on, listening to his partner&rsquo;s happy chatter&mdash;for
      Shadrach was in high spirits now&mdash;and occasionally saying a word or
      two himself. On pleasant Sundays he was driven to church and the Captain
      and Mary accompanied him. He was white and frail and thin, but the doctor
      assured them that, so far as he could see, there was no reason to expect
      anything but a complete recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did seem to Captain Shad, however, that his partner had something on
      his mind. He seemed often to be thinking deeply and at times to be
      troubled and disturbed. The Captain had never asked, never attempted by
      questioning to learn what the cause of the trouble&mdash;provided there
      was any&mdash;might be. He had been told often enough that the patient
      must not be excited, so he meant to take no risks, but Zoeth&rsquo;s long
      silences and the expression on his face as he sat there in the chair,
      evidently thinking deeply, puzzled and worried his friend and partner. He
      noticed the same expression at times when Mary was in the room. Zoeth&rsquo;s
      eyes would follow her as she moved about and in them was the look the
      Captain could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach had told his friend of Mary&rsquo;s sending young Smith away. Zoeth had
      asked concerning Crawford almost as soon as he was permitted to take part
      in a lengthy conversation. He appeared greatly interested, even eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you sure she sent him away because she
      didn&rsquo;t care for him? Are you sure that was the reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other reason could there be?&rdquo; demanded the Captain. &ldquo;She as much as
      told me that was it, herself. I was some surprised, of course, for I&rsquo;d
      rather cal&rsquo;lated &lsquo;twas as good as settled between &lsquo;em, but it turned out
      that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was talkin&rsquo; about. That HAS happened afore in my
      life, strange as it may seem,&rdquo; he added dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth sighed. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I wish I knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish you knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Oh, nothin&rsquo;. If&mdash;if I was only a little mite stronger I&rsquo;d try to
      talk with Mary-&rsquo;Gusta myself. I&rsquo;d like&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to have her tell me
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanin&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t believe me, eh? There, there, shipmate, it&rsquo;s all right.
      I was only jokin&rsquo;. But I wouldn&rsquo;t ask Mary-&rsquo;Gusta about that, if I was
      you. Course I know she cares as much or more for her Uncle Zoeth than for
      anybody on earth, and she&rsquo;d tell him anything if he asked her; but I don&rsquo;t
      believe&mdash;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask, if I was you. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Shadrach, I think I understand. You mean she felt bad to have
      to say&mdash;what she did say&mdash;to that young man and she wouldn&rsquo;t
      want to be reminded of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it, Zoeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence for some minutes. Both partners were occupied with their thoughts.
      Then Zoeth said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence. The Captain ventured to remind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Zoeth, what is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you now. By and by, if the good Lord gives
      me strength again, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;Never mind, now. Don&rsquo;t ask me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Shadrach did not ask, but he was puzzled and a little anxious. What was
      it his partner had to tell and found the telling so difficult?
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not until a day in mid-September that Captain Shadrach learned his
      partner&rsquo;s secret. He and Zoeth and Mary were at the store together.
      Business was still good, but the rush was over. The summer cottages were
      closing and most of the Cape hotels had already closed. The For&rsquo;ard
      Lookout had taken down its sign at the end of the previous week. Its
      voyage for that year was over. It had been a prosperous one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was sorry that the busy season was at an end. She was very, very
      tired; she had allowed herself no rest, had taken no holidays, had done
      her best to think of nothing except matters connected with Hamilton and
      Company or the tea-room. These, fortunately, had given her enough to think
      of; other thoughts she resolutely crowded from her mind. Now there would
      be no tea-room to plan for, and, thanks to Sim Crocker and the competent
      way in which he had assumed care of the store, she no longer felt the
      absolute necessity of remaining there from daylight until late in the
      evening. Her Uncle Zoeth was almost well, also; she would no longer have
      his health as an additional burden upon her mind. She was in danger of
      being forced to think of herself, and that she knew she must not do.
      Thinking of herself would surely mean thinking of someone else and of what
      might have been. And what useless, hopeless thinking that would be! No,
      no! She must find something else to keep her thoughts occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was planning the making over and enlarging of the store front,
      putting in larger and better windows and strengthening the platform. She
      was discussing the plan with Shadrach and Zoeth when John Keith entered.
      The Keiths were leaving South Harniss rather early that year and the head
      of the family had dropped in to say good-by. Mr. Keith&rsquo;s liking for Mary
      was as strong as ever, and for her uncles he had, by this time, a very
      real regard, a feeling which was reciprocated by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation began in the way the majority of conversations begin, with a
      discussion of the weather, its recent past, present, and probable future,
      shifted to the tea-room and its success and then to the visitor&rsquo;s recent
      trip to New York, from which city he had just returned. It was near the
      noon hour and there were few customers to interrupt. Those who did come
      were taken care of by Mr. Crocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything new happenin&rsquo; over there?&rdquo; inquired Captain Shadrach, asking
      news of the metropolis exactly as he would have asked concerning the
      gossip of Harniss Center. &ldquo;Meet anybody you knew, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith smiled. &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I met the people I went to see. Mine
      was a business trip. I didn&rsquo;t meet anyone unexpectedly, if that&rsquo;s what you
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain nodded. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t get down on South Street, did you?&rdquo; he asked.
      &ldquo;No, I thought not. If you had you&rsquo;d have met plenty. When I was goin&rsquo; to
      sea I bet I never went cruisin&rsquo; down South Street in my life that I didn&rsquo;t
      run afoul of somebody I wan&rsquo;t expectin&rsquo; to. Greatest place for meetin&rsquo; 
      folks in the world, I cal&rsquo;late South Street is. Lots of seafarin&rsquo; men have
      told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith&rsquo;s smile broadened as he was handed this nugget of wisdom. Then he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me, Captain, that I did meet someone, after all. In Boston,
      not in New York, and I met him only yesterday. It was someone you know,
      too, and Mary here used to know him quite well, I think&mdash;young
      Crawford Smith, Sam&rsquo;s Harvard friend. He visited us here in South Harniss
      one summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was the only one of the trio of listeners who made any comment at
      all on this speech. Even he did not speak for a moment, glancing
      apprehensively at Mary before doing so. Mary said nothing, and Zoeth,
      leaning back in his chair, his face hidden from his partner&rsquo;s gaze by the
      end of the counter, did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain. &ldquo;Sho! So you met him, did you! In Boston?
      That&rsquo;s funny. I had an idea he was out West somewheres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I. The last I heard concerning him he had given up his studies in
      the East here&mdash;he was studying medicine, as perhaps you know&mdash;and
      had gone back to his home in Nevada. His father, who was not at all well,
      asked him to do so. He had written Sam once or twice from out there. So I
      was surprised enough to see him in Boston. I met him in the South Station
      and we chatted for a few moments. He told me that his father was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From behind the end of the counter where Zoeth sat came an odd sound, a
      sort of gasp. Shadrach leaned forward quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Zoeth?&rdquo; he asked. Before Zoeth could answer Mary
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Mr. Keith, I&mdash;did&mdash;did you say Crawford
      Smith&rsquo;s father was DEAD?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tone was so strange that even Mr. Keith could not help noticing it. He
      looked at her, seemed about to ask a question, and then answered hers
      instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he is dead. He had been in poor health for some
      time, so his son told me, and about two weeks ago he died. Crawford did
      not tell me any particulars, nor did he say what had brought him East. In
      fact, he didn&rsquo;t seem anxious to talk; acted as if he had something on his
      mind. Of course I said I was sorry and he thanked me and inquired
      regarding Mrs. Keith and Edna and Sam. Then I had to hurry for my train. .
      . . Oh, are you going, Mary? Well, then, I must say good-by until next
      summer; we leave tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary explained, rather hurriedly, that she must speak with Simeon for a
      few minutes, said good-by, shook hands and hastened out. Keith looked
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t made a blunder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in speaking of young Smith.
      She and he were quite&mdash;er&mdash;friendly at one time, weren&rsquo;t they. I
      understood so from some remarks of Sam&rsquo;s. Didn&rsquo;t put my foot in it by
      mentioning the boy&rsquo;s name, did I? I certainly hope not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth did not speak. Shadrach hastened to reassure him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There was one time when even me and Zoeth figgered
      there might be&mdash;er&mdash;well, we didn&rsquo;t know but what he and she was
      liable to be more&rsquo;n just friends. But it&rsquo;s all off now, seems so. They
      don&rsquo;t even write each other, I guess. I cal&rsquo;late maybe Mary-&rsquo;Gusta got
      tired of him,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He was a real nice young feller, but he
      probably wan&rsquo;t quite good enough for her. Fur&rsquo;s that goes,&rdquo; he added, with
      the emphasis of absolute conviction, &ldquo;I never laid eyes on one that was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keith looked relieved. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad if I didn&rsquo;t make a mistake,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;She seemed so startled when I said that the man was dead and her
      manner was so odd. Didn&rsquo;t you notice it yourself, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I noticed she seemed sort of sot all aback,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s
      that&rsquo;s so strange when you consider that she and Crawford used to be such
      friends. More&rsquo;n probable she&rsquo;s heard him talk a good deal about his
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps so. No doubt that is it. I&rsquo;m afraid she is working too hard
      and worrying too much over her various enterprises here. She is succeeding
      wonderfully, of course, but I don&rsquo;t like to see her losing those roses in
      her cheeks. They&rsquo;re much too precious to lose. Keep your eye on her,
      Captain, and don&rsquo;t let her wear herself out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He soon said good-by. Captain Shadrach accompanied him to the door. Zoeth
      remained where he was, not rising even when he shook hands with his
      departing friend. But when the Captain turned back he saw his partner
      standing by the end of the counter and clutching it with one hand while he
      beckoned with the other. Shadrach gave him one look and then crossed the
      space between them in two strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the land sakes, Zoeth,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth waved him to silence. &ldquo;Sshh! sshh!&rdquo; he pleaded in a whisper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      holler so; she&rsquo;ll hear you. Shadrach, I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS it?&rdquo; broke in his friend. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Zoeth? Shall I
      fetch the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right, Shadrach. I&rsquo;ve just had&mdash;had a kind
      of shock&mdash;a surprise, that&rsquo;s all. I ain&rsquo;t very strong yet and it&mdash;it
      kind of upset me. But, Shadrach, I want to talk to you. I want to tell you
      somethin&rsquo; right away. I can&rsquo;t keep it to myself any longer. Can&rsquo;t we go
      home&mdash;to my room or somewheres&mdash;where we can talk? Please,
      Shadrach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, shipmate; take it easy. Go home? Course we can! Hey, Sim!&rdquo;
       shouting to Mr. Crocker, who was in the back room. &ldquo;You and Mary can take
      care of the store, can&rsquo;t you? Zoeth and me are goin&rsquo; home for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simeon replied that Mary was not there; she had gone out the back way,
      down to the house, he thought. &ldquo;But you go ahead, Cap&rsquo;n Shad,&rdquo; he added.
      &ldquo;I can take care of the store all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home, and in Mr. Hamilton&rsquo;s room, the Captain pulled forward the most
      comfortable chair, forced his partner to sit in it, closed and locked the
      door, sat down on the edge of the bed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Now we&rsquo;re all taut and shipshape and nobody can get aboard to
      interrupt. Fire away, Zoeth. What is it you&rsquo;ve got to tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth, his hand trembling, reached into the inside pocket of his coat,
      took out an old-fashioned wallet and from it produced a much-crumpled
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hardly know how to begin. It seems so
      strange to think that you and me, who&rsquo;ve been so close to each other all
      these years, should have a secret between us, if only for a little while.
      It seems wicked. I guess &lsquo;tis wicked, and I&rsquo;m the wicked one for keepin&rsquo; 
      it from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t be wicked if you was apprenticed to the Old Harry for ten
      years, Zoeth,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how to be and the devil himself
      couldn&rsquo;t teach you. Now, don&rsquo;t waste time tellin&rsquo; me I&rsquo;m speaking lightly
      of sacred things,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;For one thing, the Old Scratch ain&rsquo;t sacred,
      as I know of, and for another I want to hear that secret. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth shook his head. &ldquo;I am wicked, all the same,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I guess
      I&rsquo;ve been punished. There wan&rsquo;t any real reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t have told
      you afore, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t make up my mind to speak of it. I just
      couldn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell you now, Shadrach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held up the crumpled envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember when I was took sick?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You remember I was struck
      down all of a heap in the kitchen? Yes; well, did you ever wonder what it
      was struck me down? I&rsquo;ll tell you. &lsquo;Twas a letter that came to me in the
      mail that morning. This was the letter. I managed to put it in my inside
      vest pocket that time when Isaiah run off after you and left me lyin&rsquo; 
      there. I didn&rsquo;t want him to see it. I didn&rsquo;t want anybody to&mdash;not
      then. Now I want you to read it, Shadrach. But before you do, let me warn
      you. You should ask the Almighty to give you strength. You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to be
      surprised, Shadrach, surprised and shocked. Here it is; read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed the envelope to his partner. The latter took it, wonderingly,
      and looked at the inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s handwritin&rsquo; that I know,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it once well enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did? And it was mailed out in Carson City, Nevada. Why, that&rsquo;s where
      the Crawford Smith boy lives, ain&rsquo;t it? What on earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the envelope and from it took several sheets closely covered
      with finely written lines. He began to read and, as he read, his
      expression changed from curiosity to wonder, to amazement, to anger, to a
      mixture of the last three. The final sheet fell from his fingers to the
      floor. He looked up with a very white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later they were still talking. Shadrach had not entirely
      recovered from the surprise, but now he could think and speak more
      coherently, although the wonder of it all was overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if the hand of the Lord was in it,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Zoeth, with absolute conviction. &ldquo;See how it worked out
      accordin&rsquo; to His promise. The wicked flourished for a time, but God sent
      the punishment in due season, didn&rsquo;t He? Can&rsquo;t you see the poor feller&rsquo;s
      agonizin&rsquo; in every line of that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;POOR feller! Good Lord above, Zoeth Hamilton, you ain&rsquo;t pityin&rsquo; HIM, are
      you? You ain&rsquo;t sorry for him&mdash;YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded. &ldquo;I wan&rsquo;t at first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At first the whole thing,
      comin&rsquo; on me out of a clear sky as you might say, knocked me flat. The
      doctor, when he came, said he thought I must have had a sudden shock. I
      did; that was it, that letter. But later on, when I was gettin&rsquo; better and
      could think again, and when I was alone and had the chance and could read
      the letter again, I began to&mdash;to&mdash;well, not forgive him for what
      he done&mdash;I don&rsquo;t suppose I can ever do that&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not! Damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Shadrach; he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is. I forgot. Then he&rsquo;s damned, I guess, without any orders from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was damned here on earth, Shadrach. All his life&mdash;the last part
      of it, anyhow&mdash;must have been a torment. He must have idolized that
      boy of his. He says so in the letter, but it&rsquo;s plain on every line of the
      writin&rsquo; without his sayin&rsquo; it. And can&rsquo;t you just imagine him as the boy
      grew up and they loved each other more and more, tremblin&rsquo; and scared
      every minute for fear that somehow or other his son&rsquo;ll learn that the
      father he loves and respects is a&mdash;a thief&mdash;and&mdash;and worse?
      Seems to me I can imagine it. And then all at once the boy comes to him
      and says he wants to marry&mdash;Oh, my soul! Shadrach, think of it!&mdash;he
      wants to marry your girl and mine&mdash;Marcellus&rsquo;s stepdaughter. Why, it
      must have driven him nigh crazy. And then they quarrel, and the boy, the
      only bein&rsquo; on earth he&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; for, goes off and leaves him. And he knows
      he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; here&mdash;to us&mdash;and that some time or other he&rsquo;s sartin
      to learn everything. No wonder he wrote that letter. No wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writin&rsquo; you, of all people!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Writin&rsquo; you and beggin&rsquo; you not to
      let Mary-&rsquo;Gusta marry his son: and for what? To save the boy from
      somethin&rsquo; bad? No! For all he knew, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta might be what she is, the
      best and finest girl on earth. What he was beggin&rsquo; for was himself&mdash;that
      his son shouldn&rsquo;t know what HE was, that&rsquo;s all. No, Zoeth, I can&rsquo;t pity
      him much. He&rsquo;s dead, and that&rsquo;s a good thing, too. The wonder of it is
      that he&rsquo;s been alive all this time and we didn&rsquo;t know. And to think&mdash;but
      there; it&rsquo;s all wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both were silent for a moment. Then Zoeth said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one thing that&rsquo;s troubled me most in all this, Shadrach, is about
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta herself. How does she really feel towards Crawford? She sent
      him away, you told me that, but are you sure she did it because she didn&rsquo;t
      care enough for him to marry him? Are you sure there wan&rsquo;t any other
      reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me to understand there wan&rsquo;t. What other reason could there be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, Shadrach, it all depends, seems to me. You know
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta; the last person she thinks about on earth is herself. If she
      did think a sight of Crawford, if she thought ENOUGH of him, she wouldn&rsquo;t
      let him suffer on account of her, would she? She knew, probably, that he
      loved and respected his father and a father&rsquo;s good name must mean a lot to
      a son. Then, there is us&mdash;you and me, Shadrach. She wouldn&rsquo;t let us
      suffer, if she could help it. Do you see what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; mused the Captain, thinking aloud, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I do, Zoeth. You
      mean if Mary-&rsquo;Gusta had found out the facts about Ed Farmer, who he was
      and what he done, and if she knew Crawford Smith&rsquo;s dad WAS Ed Farmer and
      that Crawford didn&rsquo;t know it and we didn&rsquo;t know it&mdash;you mean that,
      BEIN&rsquo; Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, rather than bring sorrow and trouble on Crawford and on
      us, she&rsquo;d sacrifice her own feelin&rsquo;s and&mdash;and would pretend she
      didn&rsquo;t care for him so as to get him to go away and save him and us.
      That&rsquo;s what you mean, I presume likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Shadrach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;yes. Well, there&rsquo;s just one thing that makes that notion seem
      consider&rsquo;ble more than unlikely. How in the world could she have found out
      that there ever was an Edgar Farmer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good many folks in South Harniss could have told her that if they&rsquo;d had a
      mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so; but they couldn&rsquo;t have told her that Edwin Smith, of Carson
      City, Nevada, was ever Edgar Farmer. No, sir, they couldn&rsquo;t! Nobody knew
      it&mdash;but Ed Farmer himself. How could our Mary-&rsquo;Gusta know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Shadrach, unless&mdash;she&rsquo;s awful smart, you know&mdash;somethin&rsquo; 
      might have put her on the track and she puzzled it out. I know that ain&rsquo;t
      likely; but, Shadrach, if she does care for Crawford and he cares for her,
      I&mdash;I want &lsquo;em to have each other. I do. They must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth Hamilton,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you know what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;? You want
      our girl to marry the son of the man that&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what he did, Shadrach; you don&rsquo;t need to tell me. But he&rsquo;s dead,
      and his boy is a good boy&mdash;you liked him and so did I. And Shadrach,
      I&rsquo;ve been thinkin&rsquo; an awful lot about this since I got the letter and have
      been well enough to think. And I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to just this: There
      has been sorrow and trouble enough brought on already by that wickedness.
      There shan&rsquo;t be any more. What wrecked all our lives thirty-five years ago
      shan&rsquo;t wreck these two, if I can help it. If Mary-&rsquo;Gusta cares for him and
      he for her they must have each other and be happy. And you and I will be
      happy watchin&rsquo; their happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I wish, Shadrach, there was some way of findin&rsquo; out for sure that she
      sent him away because she didn&rsquo;t care for him and not for any other
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach rose from his chair and laid his hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
      He cleared his throat once or twice before speaking and there was still a
      shake in his voice as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth, you&rsquo;re a better man than I ever hope to be. I declare you make me
      ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them ate much dinner, although Isaiah had prepared a cranberry
      pie, made from the first fruit of the fall season, and was correspondingly
      disappointed when both of his employers left it untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t a mite of use my slavin&rsquo; myself to death cookin&rsquo; fancy vittles for
      this crew,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I stood over that cookstove this mornin&rsquo; until I
      got so everlastin&rsquo; hot that every time the cold air blowed onto me I
      steamed. And yet I can&rsquo;t satisfy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you can,&rdquo; observed Captain Shad, rising from the table. &ldquo;You
      satisfied us too quick, that was the trouble. We was satisfied afore we
      got to the pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph! I want to know! Well, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta was satisfied afore that. She
      didn&rsquo;t eat hardly anything. Said she wan&rsquo;t hungry. I swan if it ain&rsquo;t
      discouragin&rsquo;! What&rsquo;s the use of you folks havin&rsquo; a cook? If you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; 
      to have canary-bird appetites, why don&rsquo;t you feed on bird seed and be done
      with it? And I do believe I never made a better pie than that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo; asked Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She went up to her room. She may be there yet, or she may
      have come down and gone out again&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. If she did come down
      I didn&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked out of the window. It had been a dark, gloomy morning and
      now it was beginning to rain. The wind was whining through the tops of the
      silver-leafs and the moan of the breakers on the bar sounded with a
      clearness which denoted the approach of a northeaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty weather,&rdquo; observed the Captain. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;ll be dirtier yet before
      night. You better stay here in snug harbor this afternoon, Zoeth. Simmie
      and the boy and Mary-&rsquo;Gusta and I can tend store all right. Yes, yes, you
      stay right here and keep dry. Hope Mary-&rsquo;Gusta took an umbrella when she
      went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as she has gone,&rdquo; said Isaiah. &ldquo;She may be upstairs in her
      room yet. That&rsquo;s where she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach, after calling &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rdquo; several times at the foot of the
      stairs, went up to make sure. The door of Mary&rsquo;s room was closed but, as
      he received no answer to his knock, he opened it and entered. Mary was not
      there, although it was evident that she had been there very recently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently she had been writing a letter, for her writing case was spread
      out upon the table. Also the drawer in which she kept it had been left
      open, an unusual act of carelessness on her part, for, generally speaking,
      as her Uncle Shad said, &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;s ever out of place in Mary-&rsquo;Gusta&rsquo;s room
      except some of the places, and that&rsquo;s the carpenter&rsquo;s fault, not hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain stepped over to close the drawer. As he did so his attention
      was attracted by a photograph lying upon a pile of photographs in a box
      inside the drawer. He picked up the photograph and looked at it. It was
      that of Edwin Smith, taken when he seemed to be recovering from his
      illness, the one which showed him without a beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach&rsquo;s eyes opened wide as he looked at the photograph. He uttered an
      exclamation, stepped to the door of the upper hall and called, &ldquo;Zoeth!&rdquo;
       Then he returned to the table and took from the drawer the next photograph
      upon the pile in the box. It was the old, faded picture of the partners of
      Hall and Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah came stumbling up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anythin&rsquo; I can do for you, Cap&rsquo;n Shad?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Zoeth, he&rsquo;s gone out
      to shut up the barn door. Rain was liable to beat in, he said. I told him
      I&rsquo;d do it, but&mdash;Godfreys mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain had paid no attention to him and he had entered the room and
      approached his employer from behind. Now over the latter&rsquo;s shoulder he saw
      the two photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfreys mighty!&rdquo; cried the startled Isaiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? What are you starin&rsquo; like that
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them&mdash;them pictures,&rdquo; gasped Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about &lsquo;em? Where did Mary-&rsquo;Gusta get &lsquo;em, do you know? Did&mdash;Here!
      Where are you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; anywheres. I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; downstairs. I got my
      dishwashin&rsquo; to do. I&mdash;let go of me, Cap&rsquo;n Shad! I got to go this
      minute, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain did not let go of him. Instead, keeping a firm hold upon
      the collar of the frightened cook and steward, he twisted him around until
      he could look him straight in the eye. This was difficult, for Isaiah
      plainly did not wish to be looked at in that manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Captain Shad, after a moment&rsquo;s inspection. &ldquo;Humph! I
      cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ve got the right pig by the ear this time. Set down in that
      chair, Isaiah Chase; I want to talk to you.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The northeaster was developing. It was now raining hard and the wind was
      rising. The gusts swept across the top of the little hill and the window
      sashes of the For&rsquo;ard Lookout rattled and the hinges of the ancient blinds
      squeaked. The yard, which had been so attractive, was shorn of its
      decorations. The tables had been carried inside; the lanterns taken down;
      the wonderful sign, pride of the talented Mr. Bemis, had been tenderly
      conveyed to the attic. Cook, waitresses and salesgirl had departed. The
      tea-room and gift shop had gone into winter quarters to hibernate until
      the following spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms inside had been thoroughly swept and cleaned and most of the
      furniture and the best of the old prints covered with dust cloths. Some of
      the smaller articles, however, were still upon the shelves of the gift
      shop, Mary having ordered her assistants to leave them there, as she
      wished to look them over herself before putting them away. Some of her
      selections for stock had sold remarkably well and she had been obliged to
      reorder many times; others of which she had been quite confident when
      purchasing had not sold at all. Both good sellers and bad she meant to
      list as a guide to future choosing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was listing them now. Alone in the room which had once been the sacred
      best parlor of the little house, she was seated at the table, pencil in
      hand and memorandum books and paper before her. There was no particular
      reason why the listing should have been done that day; it might have been
      done any day until the weather became too cold to work in an unheated
      house. That morning she had had no idea of doing it that afternoon. She
      was doing it now because she felt that she must do something to occupy her
      mind, and because she wished to be alone. Up there at the For&rsquo;ard Lookout
      she could combine the two&mdash;work and seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Keith told, at the store that morning, the news of Edwin Smith&rsquo;s&mdash;or
      Edgar Farmer&rsquo;s&mdash;death she had been dreadfully shaken by it. It was so
      sudden, so unexpected&mdash;when she last heard the man was, so the
      doctors said, almost well. She had thought of him often enough during the
      past year; or, rather, she had thought of Crawford as being with him and
      of the father&rsquo;s joy in his son&rsquo;s return to him and the knowledge that his
      own disgraceful secret would not be revealed. And she had pictured
      Crawford as finding solace for his disappointed love in his father&rsquo;s
      society. That Edgar Farmer had been what Isaiah called him&mdash;a
      blackguard&mdash;she realized perfectly, but she was equally sure that, as
      Edwin Smith, he had been the kindest and most loving of fathers. And
      Crawford, although he had been willing to leave him because of her, loved
      him dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was dead, and Crawford was left alone. Somehow she felt
      responsible for the death. That it had been hastened by the terrible alarm
      and stress of the previous year was, of course, certain. She thought of
      Crawford alone and with this new sorrow, and this thought, and that of her
      responsibility, was almost more than she could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she must write him, that he must know she had heard and was
      thinking of him. So, after leaving the store, she had hastened down to the
      house and up the back stairs to her room. There she had written a few
      lines, not more than a note, but the composing of that note had been a
      difficult task. There was so much she longed to say and so little she
      could say. When it was written she remembered that Crawford was in Boston
      and she did not know his address. She determined to send the letter to the
      Nevada home and trust to its being forwarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took from the back of the drawer the box of photographs and looked
      them over. As she was doing so Isaiah called her to dinner. Then she heard
      her uncles come in and, because she felt that she could talk with no one
      just then, she avoided them by hastily going down the front stairs. She
      made a pretense of eating and left the house. Isaiah did not see her go.
      After stopping at the store long enough to tell Mr. Crocker she would be
      at the tea-room that afternoon, she climbed the hill, unlocked the door of
      the For&rsquo;ard Lookout, entered and began her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind howled and whined and the rain beat against the windows. The
      blinds creaked, the sashes rattled, the gusts moaned in the chimney above
      the fireplace, and all the hundred and one groanings and wailings, the
      complaints of an old house in a storm, developed. All these sounds Mary
      heard absently, her mind upon her work. Then, little by little as they
      drew nearer, she became conscious of other sounds, footfalls; someone was
      coming up the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not rise from her chair nor look up from her work when the outside
      door opened. Even when the footsteps sounded in the little hall behind her
      she did not turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am here, and I&rsquo;m safe and I&rsquo;m perfectly
      dry. Also I&rsquo;m very, very busy. Now, why did you come out in the rain to
      hunt me up? And I&rsquo;m quite sure you haven&rsquo;t put on your rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the voice behind her said: &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned now&mdash;turned, looked, and rose to her feet. Her face went
      white, then flushed red, and then paled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford Smith was standing there. His light overcoat&mdash;it was not a
      raincoat&mdash;dripped water; so did the hat in his hand. He stood there
      and looked&mdash;and dripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath, almost with a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;YOU! Oh, how could you? WHY did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward her. &ldquo;Because I felt that I must,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had
      to come. I came to see you once more. You must forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive me for coming,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;There was a question I
      had to ask and only you could answer it. It isn&rsquo;t the question I asked
      before, although perhaps that&mdash;But first I must tell you: Mary, my
      father is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. She could scarcely trust herself to speak, but she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Keith told us this morning. He said he met you in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had forgotten; so he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is how I knew. Oh, Crawford, I am so sorry for you. I have been
      writing you. But WHY did you come here again? It&mdash;it makes it so much
      harder for&mdash;for both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer the question. &ldquo;You knew my father was dead,&rdquo; he said
      again. &ldquo;I wonder&rdquo;&mdash;he was speaking slowly and his gaze was fixed upon
      her face&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder how much more you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started back. &ldquo;How much&mdash;&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;How much more&mdash;Oh,
      what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean how much did you know about my father when you and I were together&mdash;when
      I came on here and asked you to marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put a hand to her throat. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried breathlessly. &ldquo;YOU know! He
      told you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary, he told me. Before he died he told me everything. And you knew
      it! I know now why you would not marry me&mdash;the son of a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in pained astonishment. The tears sprang to her eyes.
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How can you say that to me? How can you
      think it? As if that would make any difference! I learned your father&rsquo;s
      name and&mdash;and what he had done&mdash;by accident. It was only the
      night before you came. It would have made no difference to me. For myself
      I didn&rsquo;t care&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, Crawford, how can you think it was
      because he was&mdash;that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it,&rdquo; he cried triumphantly. &ldquo;I never have thought it, Mary.
      I believe&mdash;ever since I knew, I have dared to believe that you sent
      me away because you were trying to save me from disgrace. You had learned
      who and what my father had been and I did not know. And you feared that if
      you married me the secret might come out and I would be ashamed, my career
      would be spoiled, and all that. I have dared to believe this and that is
      why I came back to you&mdash;to ask if it was true. Can&rsquo;t you see? I HAD
      to come. IS it true, Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came toward her. She would have run away if she could, but there was
      nowhere to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me, Mary,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Look at me, and tell me this: It wasn&rsquo;t
      because you didn&rsquo;t love me that you sent me away? It wasn&rsquo;t really that,
      was it? Tell me the truth. Look at me now, and tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to look and she tried to speak, but her glance faltered and fell
      before his and the words would not come. She could feel the blood rushing
      to her cheeks. She put up her hands in mute protest, but the protest was
      unavailing. His arms were about her, his kisses were upon her lips, and he
      was telling her the things which are told in times like these. And she
      struggled no longer, but permitted herself to listen, to believe, to
      accept, and to be swept away by the wonderful current of love and destiny
      against which she had fought so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the struggle was not entirely over. She made one more effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Crawford!&rdquo; she cried a little later. &ldquo;Oh, Crawford, dear, this is all
      wrong. It can&rsquo;t be. It mustn&rsquo;t be. Don&rsquo;t you see it mustn&rsquo;t? We have
      forgotten Uncle Zoeth. He doesn&rsquo;t know whose son you are. If he should
      learn, it would bring back the old story and the old trouble. He isn&rsquo;t
      well. The shock might kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Crawford merely smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does know, Mary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Father wrote him. I shall tell you the
      whole story just as Dad told it to me. Heaven knows it was not a pleasant
      one for a son to hear, but I am glad I heard it. The past was bad, but it
      is past. You and I have the future for our own and I mean to make it a
      clean one and a happy one for us both, God willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach came up the path to the tea-house, leading Isaiah by the arm. Mr.
      Chase moved reluctantly, as if led to execution or, at the very least, to
      immediate trial for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; commanded Shadrach, &ldquo;furl that umbrella and come along in here
      with me. I want you to make Mary-&rsquo;Gusta understand that you&rsquo;ve told me the
      whole business, about your tellin&rsquo; her the Ed Farmer yarn and all. After
      that you can clear out, because I want to talk to her myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and, still holding his captive by the arm, strode into
      the parlor. There he stood stock still, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford held out his hand and the Captain found himself shaking it
      warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Gould,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know now what I did not know until two weeks
      ago, how greatly my father wronged you and your partners. I know the whole
      miserable story. But, in spite of it, I am here because I love Mary and I
      want to marry her. She has told me that she loves me. I don&rsquo;t know how you
      feel about it, but I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain interrupted. &ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Heave to and come
      up into the wind a minute; let me get my bearin&rsquo;s. Young feller, if you&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo; to drop down out of the skies unexpected like this, you&mdash;Tut!
      tut! tut! Whew!&rdquo; He waited a moment, then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his arms. She came to him and he held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you care for this young feller enough for that?
      Do you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his finger beneath her chin and lifted her head to look down into
      her face. The face was crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary looked up, wet-eyed but smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Shad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want to cruise in his company all your life, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Shad; but not unless you and Uncle Zoeth are willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your heart, dearie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. Zoeth and me were
      talkin&rsquo; about this very thing a little while ago. And do you know what he
      said? He said: &lsquo;What wrecked all our lives thirty-five year ago shan&rsquo;t
      wreck these two, if I can help it. If Mary-&rsquo;Gusta cares for him and he for
      her they shall have each other and be happy. And we&rsquo;ll be happy watchin&rsquo; 
      their happiness.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he said. I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I said &lsquo;Amen&rsquo; 
      exactly, but I thought it, anyhow. God bless you, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta. Now you and
      Crawford go and see your Uncle Zoeth. He&rsquo;s down at the house. You just run
      along and tell him about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary turned to Mr. Chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Isaiah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you anything to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked at Crawford and then at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say you&rsquo;d better go somewheres, both of you, and get dry,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;His overcoat&rsquo;s soakin&rsquo; wet and your waist ain&rsquo;t much better. I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      know what sort of&mdash;of congratulations or&mdash;or whatever they be I
      ought to say, but&mdash;but I hope you&rsquo;ll be terrible happy, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Isaiah,&rdquo; laughed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re welcome. Now, just let me talk to Cap&rsquo;n Shad a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung about and faced the Captain and in his eye was triumph great and
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Shad Gould,&rdquo; crowed Isaiah, &ldquo;a good many times in the last four or
      five year you&rsquo;ve called me a fool for heavin&rsquo; out hints that somethin&rsquo; 
      about like this was liable to happen. Well? WELL? What have you got to say
      NOW? Who&rsquo;s the fool NOW? Hey? Who is?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The story of Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop is almost told. Before Crawford left
      South Harniss, which was not until the end of another week, it had been
      decided that on a day in June of the following year she should cease to be
      Mary-&rsquo;Gusta Lathrop. There was a great deal of discussion before this
      decision was reached, for many perplexing questions had to be answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was the question of Crawford&rsquo;s future. His father had left a
      comfortable fortune and an interest in mining properties which would have
      rendered it quite unnecessary for the young man to keep on with his
      professional studies had he wished to discontinue them. But he did not so
      wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I think I told you that Sunday afternoon when we first met at Mrs.
      Wyeth&rsquo;s, Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have always intended to be a doctor. Dad did
      not want me to be; he wanted me to come in with him, but I wouldn&rsquo;t do it.
      I love my work and I mean to stick to it and go on with it. If I were as
      rich as a dozen Rockefellers it wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference. But, as I
      see it, I am not rich. It is a grave question in my mind how much of that
      money out there belongs to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;I think I understand what you mean,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think there is no doubt that almost all of my father&rsquo;s money was
      made there in the West after&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated and then went on&mdash;&ldquo;after
      the&mdash;the other died and after he married my mother. But nevertheless
      I shall always feel as if whatever there was belonged to your uncles, the
      surviving members of the old firm. If I could, I should give it to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. &ldquo;Thank you for saying it, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I know you
      mean it; but it would be no use to offer; they wouldn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they wouldn&rsquo;t. So we must try and make it up to them in some other
      way. But suppose we leave that for a time and get back to my work. I&rsquo;m
      going to keep on with it; I want to and you say that you want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, very much. I am sure you will be happier in that work than in any
      other, and besides&mdash;I suppose I am ever so unpractical, but I do feel
      it&mdash;I had rather you made your own way. Somehow the idea of our
      depending upon that money out there doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;Oh, I
      can&rsquo;t explain exactly, but I don&rsquo;t like the idea a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I prefer to paddle my own canoe, if I can. But a young doctor&rsquo;s
      canoe is likely to move pretty slowly at first. And I intend taking a
      passenger, you know, and I want her to be comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary laughed, a contented little laugh. &ldquo;She will be,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Did
      I tell you of the talk Uncle Shad and I had the other day? He saw me
      sitting by the dining-room window looking out at nothing in particular&mdash;and
      looking silly enough, too, I dare say&mdash;and he asked me what I was
      thinking. I said, &lsquo;Nothing much,&rsquo; which wasn&rsquo;t true, and he said nothing
      must be good to think of, I looked so cheerful. I told him I was. Then I
      asked him&mdash;my conscience troubled me a little, you know&mdash;if he
      was sure that he and Uncle Zoeth were happy, because I shouldn&rsquo;t be unless
      they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was characteristic. What did he say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he laughed that big laugh of his and told me not to worry. &lsquo;I&rsquo;M
      feelin&rsquo; pretty average satisfied with life just now, Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;and as for Zoeth&mdash;well, he asked me this mornin&rsquo; if I didn&rsquo;t
      cal&rsquo;late &lsquo;twas wicked for him and me to be so contented with the things of
      this world, so I know HE&rsquo;S all right. When Zoeth gets real happy he always
      begins to feel sinful.&rsquo; I hope that a consciousness of sin isn&rsquo;t the only
      test of happiness,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t believe you feel wicked
      the least bit. At least you have never said you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford laughed, and there followed one of those interruptions to
      conversation with which, although undoubtedly interesting to the
      participants, outsiders are not supposed to be concerned. When it was over
      Mary said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am not so foolish as to mean that you must not touch the
      money your father left. That would be ridiculous. But I mean I think we
      should not depend upon it; it should not change our plans or spoil your
      life work, or anything like that. It will make life easier for us, of
      course, and with its help we can make it easier for other people. I think
      that is what we should do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, my dear. And our first duty, it seems to me, is toward your
      uncles. If they would consent, and I suppose there isn&rsquo;t the least chance
      that they would, I should like to sell out the store and the Lookout and
      the rest of it and take them with us, wherever we decide to go, and give
      them an easy, carefree time of it the rest of their lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary shook her head. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t like it a bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That
      precious old store is the joy of their lives. Without it they wouldn&rsquo;t
      know what to do; they would be as lost and lonesome and miserable as a
      pair of stray kittens. No, if we take care of them we must take care of
      Hamilton and Company, too. And we mustn&rsquo;t let them know we&rsquo;re doing it,
      either,&rdquo; she added with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawford looked troubled. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it is
      likely to be something of a puzzle, their problem. It will mean, of
      course, that you and I must go and leave them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, we can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;not for some time, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me we must. We have decided, you and I, that I shall go back
      West, finish my preparatory work, then come here and marry you. After that&mdash;well,
      after that we have decided that I am to locate somewhere or other and
      begin to practice my profession. You&rsquo;ll go with me then, I presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly! Of course I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped so. But if we can&rsquo;t leave your uncles and they won&rsquo;t leave the
      store, what are we going to do? Put the store on a truck and take it with
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him and smiled. &ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      quite worked it out yet, but if it does work I think it&rsquo;s going to be a
      very nice plan indeed. No, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what it is yet, so
      you mustn&rsquo;t tease. You don&rsquo;t mind my planning for you and bossing you and
      all that sort of thing, do you? I hope you don&rsquo;t, because I can&rsquo;t help it.
      It&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;m made, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. Boss away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I shall. I&rsquo;m like that Scotch girl in the play Mrs. Wyeth took me to
      see in Boston&mdash;Bunty, her name was. She made me think of myself more
      than once, although she was ever so much more clever. At the end of the
      play she said to her sweetheart, &lsquo;William, I must tell ye this: if I marry
      ye I&rsquo;ll aye be managin&rsquo; ye.&rsquo; She meant she couldn&rsquo;t help it. Neither can
      I. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a born manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crawford stooped and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember William&rsquo;s answer?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I do. It was: &lsquo;Bunty, I&rsquo;ll
      glory in my shame.&rsquo; Manage all you like, my lady, I&rsquo;ll glory in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The plan did work out and it was this: Doctor Harley, who had practiced
      medicine for forty-one years in South Harniss, was thinking of retiring
      after two more years of active work. He was willing to sell out his
      practice at the end of that time. He liked Crawford, had taken a fancy to
      him on the occasion of his first visit to the town when he was a guest of
      the Keiths. Crawford, after Mary had suggested the idea to him, called
      upon the old doctor. Before the end of the week it was arranged that after
      Crawford&rsquo;s final season of college and hospital work he was to come to
      South Harniss, work with Doctor Harley as assistant for another year, and
      then buy out the practice and, as Captain Shad said, &ldquo;put up his own
      shingle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to stay here always,&rdquo; Crawford said, &ldquo;but it will do me good
      to be here for a time. Harley&rsquo;s a tiptop old chap and a thoroughly
      competent general practitioner. He&rsquo;ll give me points that may be
      invaluable by and by. And a country practice is the best of training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And at the end of this winter I shall have
      Simeon Crocker well broken in as manager of the store. And I can sell the
      tea-room, I think. My uncles don&rsquo;t care much for that, anyway. They will
      be perfectly happy with the store to putter about in and with Simeon to
      take the hard work and care off their shoulders they can putter to their
      hearts&rsquo; content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose Simeon doesn&rsquo;t make it pay!&rdquo; suggested Crawford. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s at
      least a possibility. Everyone isn&rsquo;t a Napoleon&mdash;I should say a Queen
      Elizabeth&mdash;of finance and business like yourself, young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary&rsquo;s confidence was not in the least shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will pay,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If the townspeople and the summer cottagers
      don&rsquo;t buy enough&mdash;well, you and I can help out. There is that money
      in the West, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. It will be a chance for us&mdash;just a
      little chance. And they will never know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went away at the end of the week, but he came back for Christmas and
      again at Easter and again in the latter part of May. And soon after that,
      on a day in early June, he stood, with Sam Keith at his elbow, in the
      parlor of the white house by the shore, while Edna Keith played &ldquo;Here
      Comes the Bride&rdquo; on the piano which had been hired for the occasion; and,
      with her hand in Zoeth&rsquo;s arm, and with Captain Shadrach and Barbara Howe
      just behind, Mary walked between the two lines of smiling, teary friends
      to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely wedding; everyone said so, and as there probably never was
      a wedding which was not pronounced lovely by friends and relatives, we may
      be doubly certain of the loveliness of this. And there never was a more
      beautiful bride. All brides are beautiful, more or less, but this one was
      more. Isaiah, who had been favored with a peep at the rehearsal on the
      previous evening, was found later on by Shadrach in the kitchen in a state
      of ecstatic incoherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swan to godfreys!&rdquo; cried Isaiah. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t&mdash;ain&rsquo;t she an angel,
      though! Did you ever see anything prettier&rsquo;n she is in them clothes and
      with that&mdash;that moskeeter net on her head? An angel&mdash;yes,
      sir-ee! one of them cherrybins out of the Bible, that&rsquo;s what she is. And
      to think it&rsquo;s our Mary-&rsquo;Gusta! Say, Cap&rsquo;n Shad, will checkered pants be
      all right to wear with my blue coat tomorrow? I burnt a hole in my
      lavender ones tryin&rsquo; to press the wrinkles out of &lsquo;em. And I went down to
      the wharf in &lsquo;em last Sunday and they smell consider&rsquo;ble of fish,
      besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wedding company was small, but select. Judge Baxter and his wife were
      there and the Keiths&mdash;Mrs. Keith condescended to ornament the
      occasion; some of the &ldquo;best people&rdquo; had seen fit to make much of Mary
      Lathrop and Mrs. Keith never permitted herself to be very far behind the
      best people in anything&mdash;and Mrs. Wyeth was there, and Miss Pease,
      and Mr. Green who had received an invitation and had come from Boston, and
      Doctor Harley, and Simeon Crocker and his &ldquo;steady company,&rdquo; one of the
      tea-room young ladies, and Annabel and&mdash;and&mdash;well, a dozen or
      fifteen more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the minister asked, &ldquo;Who giveth this woman to this man?&rdquo; Zoeth
      answered, bravely, &ldquo;I do&mdash;that is, me and Shadrach.&rdquo; But no one
      laughed, because Zoeth himself was trying to smile and making rather wet
      weather of it. As for the Captain, his expression during the ceremony was
      a sort of fixed grin which he had assumed before entering the room and had
      evidently determined to wear to the finish, no matter what his emotions
      might be. But Miss Pease, always susceptible, had a delightful cry all to
      herself, and Isaiah, retiring to the hall, blew his nose with a vigor
      which, as Captain Shad said afterwards, &ldquo;had the Pollack Rip foghorn
      soundin&rsquo; like a deef and dumb sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary had managed everything, of course. Her uncles had tried to
      remonstrate with her, telling her there were plenty of others to arrange
      the flowers and attend to what the local newspaper would, in its account
      of the affair, be sure to call the &ldquo;collation,&rdquo; and to make the hundred
      and one preparations necessary for even so small and simple a wedding as
      this. But she only laughed at their remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have always wanted to
      manage someone&rsquo;s wedding and I am certainly not going to let anyone else
      manage mine. I don&rsquo;t care a bit whether it is the proper thing or not.
      This isn&rsquo;t going to be a formal affair; I won&rsquo;t have it so. Uncle Shad, if
      you want to say &lsquo;Jumpin&rsquo; fire&rsquo; when Crawford drops the ring, as he is
      almost sure to do, you have my permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Crawford did not drop the ring, and so the Captain&rsquo;s favorite
      exclamation was not uttered, being unnecessary. In fact there were no
      mishaps, everything went exactly as it should, reception and &ldquo;collation&rdquo;
       included, and, to quote from the South Harniss local once more, &ldquo;A good
      time was had by all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the bride and groom, dressed in their traveling costumes, came
      down the stairs to the carriage which was to take them to the station,
      Mary ran back, amid the shower of rice and confetti, to kiss Uncle Zoeth
      and Uncle Shad once more and whisper in their ears not to feel that she
      had really gone, because she hadn&rsquo;t but would be back in just a little
      while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have told Isaiah about your rubbers and oilskins when it rains,&rdquo;
       she added, in Shadrach&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;and he is not to forget Uncle Zoeth&rsquo;s
      medicine. Good-by. Good-by. Don&rsquo;t be lonesome. Promise that you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to promise is easy and to keep that promise is often hard, as Shadrach
      observed when he and Zoeth were alone in the sitting-room that evening. &ldquo;I
      feel as if the whole vitals of this place had gone away on that afternoon
      train,&rdquo; the Captain admitted. &ldquo;And yet I know it&rsquo;s awful foolish, &lsquo;cause
      she&rsquo;ll only be gone a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that question about the name is settled,&rdquo; mused Zoeth. &ldquo;That
      kind of troubled me, that did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The partners had worried not a little over the question of whether
      Crawford&rsquo;s name was legally Smith or Farmer. If it were Farmer and he must
      be so called in South Harniss, they feared the revival of the old scandal
      and all its miserable gossip. But when they asked Crawford he reassured
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consulted my lawyer about that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s middle name was
      Smith; that is why he took it, I suppose. Edwin Smith is not so very
      different from Edgar Smith Farmer, shorter, that&rsquo;s all. He and my mother
      were married under the name of Smith. Mother never knew he had had another
      name. I was born Smith and christened Smith and my lawyer tells me that
      Smith I am. If there had been any question I should have petitioned to
      have the name changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that question was settled and Shadrach and Zoeth felt easier because of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zoeth,&rdquo; observed Shadrach, after replying to his friend&rsquo;s remark
      concerning the name, &ldquo;do you know what I kind of felt as if we&rsquo;d ought to
      have had here this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Shadrach,&rdquo; replied Zoeth, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seemed to me we&rsquo;d ought to had one of them music box chairs. I&rsquo;d like to
      have put it under that Keith woman and seen her face when the Campbells
      started to come. Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world made you think of that?&rdquo; demanded his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Thinkin&rsquo; about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta, I cal&rsquo;late, set me to
      rememberin&rsquo; how we fust met her and about Marcellus&rsquo;s funeral and all.
      That made me think of the chair, you see. I ain&rsquo;t thought of it afore for
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zoeth nodded. &ldquo;Shadrach,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that was a blessed day for you and me,
      the day when we brought that child home in our old buggy. The Lord put her
      there, Shadrach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess likely He did, maybe, in a way of speakin&rsquo;. Does seem so,
      that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our lives was pretty sot and narrow afore she came. She&rsquo;s changed
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. Hello! What&rsquo;s that noise? I declare if it ain&rsquo;t Isaiah liftin&rsquo; 
      up his voice in song! In a hymn tune! What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the kitchen, above the rattle of dishes, Mr. Chase&rsquo;s nasal falsetto
      quavered shrilly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There shall be showers of blessin&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Captain interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, you&mdash;what&rsquo;s your name&mdash;Jennie Lind&mdash;come in here,&rdquo; he
      hailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chase appeared, his arms dripping soapsuds. &ldquo;What do you want, callin&rsquo; 
      me out of my name?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know what started you singin&rsquo; about blessin&rsquo;s? Fust I thought
      &lsquo;twas the weathervane squeakin&rsquo;. What tuned you up, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah looked rather foolish, but he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; about Mary-&rsquo;Gusta,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was, eh? Well, she&rsquo;s been a blessin&rsquo; to us, there&rsquo;s no doubt about
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she has,&rdquo; concurred Zoeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Isaiah had the final word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n one blessin&rsquo;, she&rsquo;s a whole shower.
      That&rsquo;s what set me to singin&rsquo; about &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He departed for the kitchen once more, the falsetto rising triumphant:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There shall be showers of blessin&rsquo;s,
     Send &lsquo;em upon us, oh Lord!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Captain Shad looked after him. Then he turned to his friend and partner
      and said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Isaiah&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; real kind of sensible in his old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
