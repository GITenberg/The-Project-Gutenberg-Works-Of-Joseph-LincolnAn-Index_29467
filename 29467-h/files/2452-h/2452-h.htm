<h2>
    CHAPTER I
</h2>
<p>
    Mr. Gabriel Bearse was happy.  The prominence given to this
    statement is not meant to imply that Gabriel was, as a general
    rule, unhappy.  Quite the contrary; Mr. Bearse's disposition was a
    cheerful one and the cares of this world had not rounded his plump
    shoulders.  But Captain Sam Hunniwell had once said, and Orham
    public opinion agreed with him, that Gabe Bearse was never happy
    unless he was talking.  Now here was Gabriel, not talking, but
    walking briskly along the Orham main road, and yet so distinctly
    happy that the happiness showed in his gait, his manner and in the
    excited glitter of his watery eye.  Truly an astonishing condition
    of things and tending, one would say, to prove that Captain Sam's
    didactic remark, so long locally accepted and quoted as gospel
    truth, had a flaw in its wisdom somewhere.
</p>
<p>
    And yet the flaw was but a small one and the explanation simple.
    Gabriel was not talking at that moment, it is true, but he was
    expecting to talk very soon, to talk a great deal.  He had just
    come into possession of an item of news which would furnish his
    vocal machine gun with ammunition sufficient for wordy volley after
    volley.  Gabriel was joyfully contemplating peppering all Orham
    with that bit of gossip.  No wonder he was happy; no wonder he
    hurried along the main road like a battery galloping eagerly into
    action.
</p>
<p>
    He was on his way to the post office, always the gossip-
    sharpshooters' first line trench, when, turning the corner where
    Nickerson's Lane enters the main road, he saw something which
    caused him to pause, alter his battle-mad walk to a slower one,
    then to a saunter, and finally to a halt altogether.  This
    something was a toy windmill fastened to a white picket fence and
    clattering cheerfully as its arms spun in the brisk, pleasant
    summer breeze.

</p>
<p>
    The little windmill was one of a dozen, all fastened to the top
    rail of that fence and all whirling.  Behind the fence, on posts,
    were other and larger windmills; behind these, others larger still.
    Interspersed among the mills were little wooden sailors swinging
    paddles; weather vanes in the shapes of wooden whales, swordfish,
    ducks, crows, seagulls; circles of little wooden profile sailboats,
    made to chase each other 'round and 'round a central post.  All of
    these were painted in gay colors, or in black and white, and all
    were in motion.  The mills spun, the boats sailed 'round and
    'round, the sailors did vigorous Indian club exercises with their
    paddles.  The grass in the little yard and the tall hollyhocks in
    the beds at its sides swayed and bowed and nodded.  Beyond, seen
    over the edge of the bluff and stretching to the horizon, the blue
    and white waves leaped and danced and sparkled.  As a picture of
    movement and color and joyful bustle the scene was inspiring;
    children, viewing it for the first time, almost invariably danced
    and waved their arms in sympathy.  Summer visitors, loitering idly
    by, suddenly became fired with the desire to set about doing
    something, something energetic.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel Bearse was not a summer visitor, but a "native," that is,
    an all-the-year-round resident of Orham, and, as his fellow natives
    would have cheerfully testified, it took much more than windmills
    to arouse HIS energy.  He had not halted to look at the mills.  He
    had stopped because the sight of them recalled to his mind the fact
    that the maker of these mills was a friend of one of the men most
    concerned in his brand new news item.  It was possible, barely
    possible, that here was an opportunity to learn just a little more,
    to obtain an additional clip of cartridges before opening fire on
    the crowd at the post office.  Certainly it might be worth trying,
    particularly as the afternoon mail would not be ready for another
    hour, even if the train was on time.
</p>
<p>
    At the rear of the little yard, and situated perhaps fifty feet
    from the edge of the high sand bluff leading down precipitously to
    the beach, was a shingled building, whitewashed, and with a door,
    painted green, and four windows on the side toward the road.  A
    clamshell walk led from the gate to the doors.  Over the door was a
    sign, very neatly lettered, as follows: "J. EDGAR W. WINSLOW.
    MILLS FOR SALE."  In the lot next to that, where the little shop
    stood, was a small, old-fashioned story-and-a-half Cape Cod house,
    painted a speckless white, with vivid green blinds.  The blinds
    were shut now, for the house was unoccupied.  House and shop and
    both yards were neat and clean as a New England kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel Bearse, after a moment's reflection, opened the gate in the
    picket fence and walked along the clamshell walk to the shop door.
    Opening the door, he entered, a bell attached to the top of the
    door jingling as he did so.  The room which Mr. Bearse entered was
    crowded from floor to ceiling, save for a narrow passage, with hit-
    or-miss stacks of the wooden toys evidently finished and ready for
    shipment.  Threading his way between the heaps of sailors, mills,
    vanes and boats, Gabriel came to a door evidently leading to
    another room.  There was a sign tacked to this door, which read,
    "PRIVATE," but Mr. Bearse did not let that trouble him.  He pushed
    the door open.
</p>
<p>
    The second room was evidently the work-shop.  There were a circular
    saw and a turning lathe, with the needful belts, and a small
    electric motor to furnish power.  Also there were piles of lumber,
    shelves of paint pots and brushes, many shavings and much sawdust.
    And, standing beside a dilapidated chair from which he had
    evidently risen at the sound of the door bell, with a dripping
    paint brush in one hand and a wooden sailor in the other, there was
    a man.  When he saw who his visitor was he sat down again.
</p>
<p>
    He was a tall man and, as the chair he sat in was a low one and the
    heels of his large shoes were hooked over its lower rounds, his
    knees and shoulders were close together when he bent over his work.
    He was a thin man and his trousers hung about his ankles like a
    loose sail on a yard.  His hair was thick and plentiful, a brown
    sprinkled with gray at the temples.  His face was smooth-shaven,
    with wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and mouth.  He wore
    spectacles perched at the very end of his nose, and looked down
    over rather than through them as he dipped the brush in the can of
    paint beside him on the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Shavin's," hailed Mr. Bearse, blithely.
</p>
<p>
    The tall man applied the brush to the nude pine legs of the wooden
    sailor.  One side of those legs were modestly covered forthwith by
    a pair of sky-blue breeches.  The artist regarded the breeches
    dreamily.  Then he said:
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Gab."
</p>
<p>
    His voice was a drawl, very deliberate, very quiet, rather soft and
    pleasant.  But Mr. Bearse was not pleased.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't call me that," he snapped.
</p>
<p>
    The brush was again dipped in the paint pot and the rear elevation
    of the pine sailor became sky-blue like the other side of him.
    Then the tall man asked:
</p>
<p>
    "Call you what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Gab.  That's a divil of a name to call anybody.  Last time I was
    in here Cap'n Sam Hunniwell heard you call me that and I cal'lated
    he'd die laughin'.  Seemed to cal'late there was somethin'
    specially dum funny about it.  I don't call it funny.  Say,
    speakin' of Cap'n Sam, have you heard the news about him?"
</p>
<p>
    He asked the question eagerly, because it was a part of what he
    came there to ask.  His eagerness was not contagious.  The man on
    the chair put down the blue brush, took up a fresh one, dipped it
    in another paint pot and proceeded to garb another section of his
    sailor in a spotless white shirt.  Mr. Bearse grew impatient.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you heard the news about Cap'n Sam?" he repeated.  "Say,
    Shavin's, have you?"
</p>
<p>
    The painting went serenely on, but the painter answered.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Gab," he drawled, "I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't call me Gab, I tell you.  'Tain't my name."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "You know well enough 'tain't.  My name's Gabriel.  Call me that&#8212;
    or Gabe.  I don't like to be called out of my name.  But say,
    Shavin's&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Gab, say it."
</p>
<p>
    "Look here, Jed Winslow, do you hear me?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, hear you fust rate, Gabe&#8212;now."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse's understanding was not easily penetrated; a hint
    usually glanced from it like a piece of soap from a slanting cellar
    door, but this time the speaker's tone and the emphasis on the
    "now" made a slight dent.  Gabriel's eyes opened.
</p>
<p>
    "Huh?" he grunted in astonishment, as if the possibility had never
    until that moment occured to him.  "Why, say, Jed, don't you like
    to be called 'Shavin's'?"
</p>
<p>
    No answer.  A blue collar was added to the white shirt of the
    sailor.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you, Jed?" repeated Gabe.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow's gaze was lifted from his work and his eyes turned
    momentarily in the direction of his caller.
</p>
<p>
    "Gabe," he drawled, "did you ever hear about the feller that was
    born stone deef and the Doxology?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  What&#8212;  No, I never heard it."
</p>
<p>
    The eyes turned back to the wooden sailor and Mr. Winslow chose
    another brush.
</p>
<p>
    "Neither did he," he observed, and began to whistle what sounded
    like a dirge.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse stared at him for at least a minute.  Then he shook his
    head.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, by Judas!" he exclaimed.  "I&#8212;I&#8212;I snum if I don't think you
    BE crazy, same as some folks say you are!  What in the nation has&#8212;
    has your name got to do with a deef man and the Doxology?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, nothin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Then what did you bust loose and tell me about 'em for?  They
    wan't any of MY business, was they?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  That's why I spoke of 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "What?  You spoke of 'em 'cause they wan't any of my business?"
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es . . . I thought maybe&#8212;"  He paused, turned the sailor over
    in his hand, whistled a few more bars of the dirge and then
    finished his sentence.  "I thought maybe you might like to ask
    questions about 'em," he concluded.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse stared suspiciously at his companion, swallowed several
    times and, between swallows, started to speak, but each time gave
    it up.  Mr. Winslow appeared quite oblivious of the stare.  His
    brushes gave the wooden sailor black hair, eyes and brows, and an
    engaging crimson smile.  When Gabriel did speak it was not
    concerning names.
</p>
<p>
    "Say, Jed," he cried, "HAVE you heard about Cap'n Sam Hunniwell?
    'Bout his bein' put on the Exemption Board?"
</p>
<p>
    His companion went on whistling, but he nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," grunted Gabe, grudgingly.  "I presumed likely you would
    hear; he told you himself, I cal'late.  Seth Baker said he see him
    come in here night afore last and I suppose that's when he told
    you.  Didn't say nothin' else, did he?" he added, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
    Again Mr. Winslow nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Did he?  Did he?  What else did he say?"
</p>
<p>
    The tall man seemed to consider.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he drawled, at length, "seems to me I remember him sayin'&#8212;
    sayin'&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?  Yes?  What did he say?"
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;er&#8212;seems to me he said good night just afore he went home."
</p>
<p>
    The disappointed Gabriel lost patience.  "Oh, you DIVILISH fool
    head!" he exclaimed, disgustedly.  "Look here, Jed Winslow, talk
    sense for a minute, if you can, won't you?  I've just heard
    somethin' that's goin' to make a big row in this town and it's got
    to do with Cap'n Sam's bein' app'inted on that Gov'ment Exemption
    Board for drafted folks.  If you'd heard Phineas Babbitt goin' on
    the way I done, I guess likely you'd have been interested."
</p>
<p>
    It was plain that, for the first time since his caller intruded
    upon his privacy, the maker of mills and sailors WAS interested.
    He did not put down his brush, but he turned his head to look and
    listen.  Bearse, pleased with this symptom of attention, went on.
</p>
<p>
    "I was just into Phineas' store," he said, "and he was there, so I
    had a chance to talk with him.  He's been up to Boston and never
    got back till this afternoon, so I cal'lated maybe he hadn't heard
    about Cap'n Sam's app'intment.  And I knew, too, how he does hate
    the Cap'n; ain't had nothin' but cuss words and such names for him
    ever since Sam done him out of gettin' the postmaster's job.
    Pretty mean trick, some folks call it, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow interrupted; his drawl was a trifle less evident.
</p>
<p>
    "Congressman Taylor asked Sam for the truth regardin' Phineas and a
    certain matter," he said.  "Sam told the truth, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, maybe that's so, but does tellin' the truth about folks make
    'em love you?  I don't know as it does."
</p>
<p>
    Winslow appeared to meditate.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he observed, thoughtfully, "I don't suppose you do."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I . . . Eh?  What do you mean by that?  Look here, Jed
    Winslow, if&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed held up a big hand.  "There, there, Gabe," he suggested,
    mildly.  "Let's hear about Sam and Phin Babbitt.  What was Phineas
    goin' on about when you was in his store?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse forgot personal grievance in his eagerness to tell the
    story.
</p>
<p>
    "Why," he began, "you see, 'twas like this: 'Twas all on account of
    Leander.  Leander's been drafted.  You know that, of course?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  Leander Babbitt was the son of Phineas Babbitt,
    Orham's dealer in hardware and lumber and a leading political boss.
    Between Babbitt, Senior, and Captain Sam Hunniwell, the latter
    President of the Orham National Bank and also a vigorous
    politician, the dislike had always been strong.  Since the affair
    of the postmastership it had become, on Babbitt's part, an intense
    hatred.  During the week just past young Babbitt's name had been
    drawn as one of Orham's quota for the new National Army.  The
    village was still talking of the draft when the news came that
    Captain Hunniwell had been selected as a member of the Exemption
    Board for the district, the Board which was to hold its sessions at
    Ostable and listen to the pleas of those desiring to be excused
    from service.  Not all of Orham knew this as yet.  Jed Winslow had
    heard it, from Captain Sam himself.  Gabe Bearse had heard it
    because he made it his business to hear everything, whether it
    concerned him or not&#8212;preferably not.
</p>
<p>
    The war had come to Orham with the unbelievable unreality with
    which it had come to the great mass of the country.  Ever since the
    news of the descent of von Kluck's hordes upon devoted Belgium, in
    the fall of 1914, the death grapple in Europe had, of course, been
    the principal topic of discussion at the post office and around the
    whist tables at the Setuckit Club, where ancient and retired
    mariners met and pounded their own and each other's knees while
    they expressed sulphurous opinions concerning the attitude of the
    President and Congress.  These opinions were, as a usual thing,
    guided by the fact of their holders' allegiance to one or the other
    of the great political parties.  Captain Sam Hunniwell, a lifelong
    and ardent Republican, with a temper as peppery as the chile con
    carne upon which, when commander of a steam freighter trading with
    Mexico, he had feasted so often&#8212;Captain Sam would have hoisted the
    Stars and Stripes to the masthead the day the Lusitania sank and
    put to sea in a dory, if need be, and armed only with a shotgun, to
    avenge that outrage.  To hear Captain Sam orate concerning the
    neglect of duty of which he considered the United States government
    guilty was an experience, interesting or shocking, according to the
    drift of one's political or religious creed.
</p>
<p>
    Phineas Babbitt, on the contrary, had at first upheld the policy of
    strict neutrality.  "What business is it of ours if them furriners
    take to slaughterin' themselves?" he wanted to know.  He hotly
    declared the Lusitania victims plaguey fools who knew what they
    were riskin' when they sailed and had got just what was comin' to
    'em&#8212;that is, he was proclaiming it when Captain Sam heard him;
    after that the captain issued a proclamation of his own and was
    proceeding to follow words with deeds.  The affair ended by mutual
    acquaintances leading Captain Sam from the Babbitt Hardware
    Company's store, the captain rumbling like a volcano and, to follow
    up the simile, still emitting verbal brimstone and molten lava,
    while Mr. Babbitt, entrenched behind his counter, with a monkey
    wrench in his hand, dared his adversary to lay hands on a law-
    abiding citizen.
</p>
<p>
    When the Kaiser and von Tirpitz issued their final ultimatum,
    however, and the President called America to arms, Phineas, in
    company with others of his breed, appeared to have experienced a
    change of heart.  At all events he kept his anti-war opinions to
    himself and, except that his hatred for the captain was more
    virulent than ever since the affair of the postmastership, he found
    little fault with the war preparations in the village, the
    organizing of a Home Guard, the raising of funds for a new flag and
    flagpole and the recruiting meeting in the town hall.
</p>
<p>
    At that meeting a half dozen of Orham's best young fellows had
    expressed their desire to fight for Uncle Sam.  The Orham band&#8212;
    minus its first cornet, who was himself one of the volunteers&#8212;had
    serenaded them at the railway station and the Congregational
    minister and Lawyer Poundberry of the Board of Selectmen had made
    speeches.  Captain Sam Hunniwell, being called upon to say a few
    words, had said a few&#8212;perhaps, considering the feelings of the
    minister and the feminine members of his flock present, it is well
    they were not more numerous.
</p>
<p>
    "Good luck to you, boys," said Captain Sam.  "I wish to the
    Almighty I was young enough to go with you.  And say, if you see
    that Kaiser anywheres afloat or ashore give him particular merry
    hell for me, will you?"
</p>
<p>
    And then, a little later, came the news that the conscription bill
    had become a law and that the draft was to be a reality.  And with
    that news the war itself became a little more real.  And, suddenly,
    Phineas Babbitt, realizing that his son, Leander, was twenty-five
    years old and, therefore, within the limits of the draft age,
    became once more an ardent, if a little more careful, conscientious
    objector.
</p>
<p>
    He discovered that the war was a profiteering enterprise engineered
    by capital and greed for the exploiting of labor and the common
    people.  Whenever he thought it safe to do so he aired these
    opinions and, as there were a few of what Captain Hunniwell called
    "yellow-backed swabs" in Orham or its neighborhood, he occasionally
    had sympathetic listeners.  Phineas, it is only fair to say, had
    never heretofore shown any marked interest in labor except to get
    as much of it for as little money as possible.  If his son,
    Leander, shared his father's opinions, he did not express them.  In
    fact he said very little, working steadily in the store all day and
    appearing to have something on his mind.  Most people liked
    Leander.
</p>
<p>
    Then came the draft and Leander was drafted.  He said very little
    about it, but his father said a great deal.  The boy should not go;
    the affair was an outrage.  Leander wasn't strong, anyway; besides,
    wasn't he his father's principal support?  He couldn't be spared,
    that's all there was about it, and he shouldn't be.  There was
    going to be an Exemption Board, wasn't there?  All right&#8212;just wait
    until he, Phineas, went before that board.  He hadn't been in
    politics all these years for nothin'.  Sam Hunniwell hadn't got all
    the pull there was in the county.
</p>
<p>
    And then Captain Sam was appointed a member of that very board.  He
    had dropped in at the windmill shop the very evening when he
    decided to accept and told Jed Winslow all about it.  There never
    were two people more unlike than Sam Hunniwell and Jed Winslow, but
    they had been fast friends since boyhood.  Jed knew that Phineas
    Babbitt had been on a trip to Boston and, therefore, had not heard
    of the captain's appointment.  Now, according to Gabriel Bearse, he
    had returned and had heard of it, and according to Bearse's excited
    statement he had "gone on" about it.
</p>
<p>
    "Leander's been drafted," repeated Gabe.  "And that was bad enough
    for Phineas, he bein' down on the war, anyhow.  But he's been
    cal'latin', I cal'late, to use his political pull to get Leander
    exempted off.  Nine boards out of ten, if they'd had a man from
    Orham on 'em, would have gone by what that man said in a case like
    Leander's.  And Phineas, he was movin' heavens and earth to get one
    of his friends put on as the right Orham man.  And now&#8212;NOW, by
    godfreys domino, they've put on the ONE man that Phin can't
    influence, that hates Phin worse than a cat hates a swim.  Oh, you
    ought to heard Phineas go on when I told him.  He'd just got off
    the train, as you might say, so nobody'd had a chance to tell him.
    I was the fust one, you see.  So&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Was Leander there?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, he wan't.  There wan't nobody in the store but Susie Ellis,
    that keeps the books there now, and Abner Burgess's boy, that runs
    errands and waits on folks when everybody else is busy.  That was a
    funny thing, too&#8212;that about Leander's not bein' there.  Susie said
    she hadn't seen him since just after breakfast time, half past
    seven o'clock or so, and when she telephoned the Babbitt house it
    turned out he hadn't been there, neither.  Had his breakfast and
    went out, he did, and that's all his step-ma knew about him.  But
    Phineas, he. . . .  Eh?  Ain't that the bell?  Customer, I presume
    likely.  Want me to go see who 'tis, Shavin's&#8212;Jed, I mean?"

<h2>
    CHAPTER II
</h2>
<p>
    But the person who had entered the outer shop saved Mr. Bearse the
    trouble.  He, too, disregarded the "Private" sign on the door of
    the inner room.  Before Gabriel could reach it that door was thrown
    open and the newcomer entered.  He was a big man, gray-mustached,
    with hair a grizzled red, and with blue eyes set in a florid face.
    The hand which had opened the door looked big and powerful enough
    to have knocked a hole in it, if such a procedure had been
    necessary.  And its owner looked quite capable of doing it, if he
    deemed it necessary, in fact he looked as if he would rather have
    enjoyed it.  He swept into the room like a northwest breeze, and
    two bundles of wooden strips, cut to the size of mill arms,
    clattered to the floor as he did so.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Jed!" he hailed, in a voice which measured up to the rest
    of him.  Then, noticing Mr. Bearse for the first time, he added:
    "Hello, Gabe, what are you doin' here?"
</p>
<p>
    Gabriel hastened to explain.  His habitual desire to please and
    humor each person he met&#8212;each person of consequence, that is; very
    poor people or village eccentrics like Jed Winslow did not much
    matter, of course&#8212;was in this case augmented by a particular
    desire to please Captain Sam Hunniwell.  Captain Sam, being one of
    Orham's most influential men, was not, in Mr. Bearse's estimation,
    at all the sort of person whom it was advisable to displease.  He
    might&#8212;and did&#8212;talk disparagingly of him behind his back, as he
    did behind the back of every one else, but he smiled humbly and
    spoke softly in his presence.  The consciousness of having just
    been talking of him, however, of having visited that shop for the
    express purpose of talking about him, made the explaining process a
    trifle embarrassing.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, howd'ye do, howd'ye do, Cap'n Hunniwell?" stammered Gabriel.
    "Nice day, ain't it, sir?  Yes, sir, 'tis a nice day.  I was just&#8212;
    er&#8212;that is, I just run in to see Shavin's here; to make a little
    call, you know.  We was just settin' here talkin', wan't we,
    Shavin's&#8212;Jed, I mean?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow stood his completed sailor man in a rack to dry.
</p>
<p>
    "Ya-as," he drawled, solemnly, "that was about it, I guess.  Have a
    chair, Sam, won't you? . . .  That was about it, we was sittin' and
    talkin' . . .  I was sittin' and Gab&#8212;Gabe, I mean&#8212;was talkin'."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam chuckled.  As Winslow and Mr. Bearse were occupying the
    only two chairs in the room he accepted the invitation in its broad
    sense and, turning an empty box upon end, sat down on that.
</p>
<p>
    "So Gabe was talkin', eh?" he repeated.  "Well, that's singular.
    How'd that happen, Gabe?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse looked rather foolish.  "Oh, we was just&#8212;just talkin'
    about&#8212;er&#8212;this and that," he said, hastily.  "Just this and that,
    nothin' partic'lar.  Cal'late I'll have to be runnin' along now,
    Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed Winslow selected a new and unpainted sailor from the pile near
    him.  He eyed it dreamily.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Gabe," he observed, "if you must, you must, I suppose.
    Seems to me you're leavin' at the most interestin' time.  We've
    been talkin' about this and that, same as you say, and now you're
    leavin' just as 'this' has got here.  Maybe if you wait&#8212;wait&#8212;a&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The sentence died away into nothingness.  He had taken up the brush
    which he used for the blue paint.  There was a loose bristle in it.
    He pulled this out and one or two more came with it.
</p>
<p>
    "Hu-um!" he mused, absently.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam was tired of waiting.
</p>
<p>
    "Come, finish her out, Jed&#8212;finish her out," he urged.  "What's the
    rest of it?"
</p>
<p>
    "I cal'late I'll run along now," said Mr. Bearse, nervously moving
    toward the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Hold on a minute," commanded the captain.  "Jed hadn't finished
    what he was sayin' to you.  He generally talks like one of those
    continued-in-our-next yarns in the magazines.  Give us the
    September installment, Jed&#8212;come."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow smiled, a slow, whimsical smile that lit up his lean,
    brown face and then passed away as slowly as it had come, lingering
    for an instant at one corner of his mouth.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I was just tellin' Gabe that the 'this' he was talkin' about
    was here now," he said, "and that maybe if he waited a space the
    'that' would come, too.  Seems to me if I was you, Gabe, I'd&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But Mr. Bearse had gone.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell snorted.  "Humph!" he said; "I judge likely I'm
    the 'this' you and that gas bag have been talkin' about.  Who's the
    'that'?"
</p>
<p>
    His companion was gazing absently at the door through which Gabriel
    had made his hurried departure.  After gazing at it in silence for
    a moment, he rose from the chair, unfolding section by section like
    a pocket rule, and, crossing the room, opened the door and took
    from its other side the lettered sign "Private" which had hung
    there.  Then, with tacks and a hammer, he proceeded to affix the
    placard to the inner side of the door, that facing the room where
    he and Captain Sam were.  The captain regarded this operation with
    huge astonishment.
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!" he exclaimed.  "What in thunder are you doin' that
    for?  This is the private room in here, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow, returning to his chair, nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Ya-as," he admitted, "that's why I'm puttin' the 'Private' sign on
    this side of the door."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, but&#8212;  Why, confound it, anybody who sees it there will think
    it is the other room that's private, won't they?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "I'm in hopes they will," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "You're in hopes they will!  Why?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause if Gabe Bearse thinks that room's private and that he don't
    belong there he'll be sartin sure to go there; then maybe he'll
    give me a rest."
</p>
<p>
    He selected a new brush and went on with his painting.  Captain
    Hunniwell laughed heartily.  Then, all at once, his laughter ceased
    and his face assumed a troubled expression.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he ordered, "leave off daubin' at that wooden doll baby for
    a minute, will you?  I want to talk to you.  I want to ask you what
    you think I'd better do.  I know what Gab Bearse&#8212;  Much obliged
    for that name, Jed; 'Gab's' the best name on earth for that
    critter&#8212;I know what Gab came in here to talk about.  'Twas about
    me and my bein' put on the Exemption Board, of course.  That was
    it, wan't it?  Um-hm, I knew 'twas.  I was the 'this' in his 'this
    and that.'  And Phin Babbitt was the 'that'; I'll bet on it.  Am I
    right?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Sure thing!" continued the captain.  "Well, there 'tis.  What am I
    goin' to do?  When they wanted me to take the job in the first
    place I kind of hesitated.  You know I did.  'Twas bound to be one
    of those thankless sort of jobs that get a feller into trouble,
    bound to be.  And yet&#8212;and yet&#8212;well, SOMEBODY has to take those
    kind of jobs.  And a man hadn't ought to talk all the time about
    how he wishes he could do somethin' to help his country, and then
    lay down and quit on the first chance that comes his way, just
    'cause that chance ain't&#8212;ain't eatin' up all the pie in the state
    so the Germans can't get it, or somethin' like that.  Ain't that
    so?"
</p>
<p>
    "Seems so to me, Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Well, so I said I'd take my Exemption Board job.  But when I
    said I'd accept it, it didn't run across my mind that Leander
    Babbitt was liable to be drafted, first crack out of the box.  Now
    he IS drafted, and, if I know Phin Babbitt, the old man will be
    down on us Board fellers the first thing to get the boy exempted.
    AND, I bein' on the Board and hailin' from his own town, Orham
    here, it would naturally be to me that he'd come first.  Eh?
    That's what he'd naturally do, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    His friend nodded once more.  Captain Sam lost patience.
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!" he exclaimed.  "Jed Winslow, for thunder sakes say
    somethin'!  Don't set there bobbin' your head up and down like one
    of those wound-up images in a Christmas-time store window.  I ask
    you if that ain't what Phin Babbitt would do?  What would you do if
    you was in his shoes?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Step out of 'em, I guess likely," he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  Yes&#8212;well, any self-respectin' person would do that, even
    if he had to go barefooted the rest of his life.  But, what I'm
    gettin' at is this: Babbitt'll come to me orderin' me to get
    Leander exempted.  And what'll I say?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow turned and looked at him.
</p>
<p>
    "Seems to me, Sam," he answered, "that if that thing happened
    there'd be only one thing to say.  You'd just have to tell him that
    you'd listen to his reasons and if they seemed good enough to let
    the boy off, for your part you'd vote to let him off.  If they
    didn't seem good enough&#8212;why&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, then Leander'd have to go to war and his dad could go to&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Go on.  I want to hear you say it.  Where could he go?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed wiped the surplus paint from his brush on the edge of the can.
</p>
<p>
    "To sellin' hardware," he concluded, gravely, but with a twinkle in
    his eye.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam sniffed, perhaps in disappointment.  "His hardware'd
    melt where I'D tell him to go," he declared.  "What you say is all
    right, Ed.  It's an easy doctrine to preach, but, like lots of
    other preacher's doctrines, it's hard to live up to.  Phin loves me
    like a step-brother and I love him the same way.  Well, now here he
    comes to ask me to do a favor for him.  If I don't do it, he'll
    say, and the whole town'll say, that I'm ventin' my spite on him,
    keepin' on with my grudge, bein' nasty, cussed, everything that's
    mean.  If I do do it, if I let Leander off, all hands'll say that I
    did it because I was afraid of Phineas and the rest would say the
    other thing.  It puts me in a devil of a position.  It's all right
    to say, 'Do your duty,' 'Stand up in your shoes,' 'Do what you
    think's right, never mind whose boy 'tis,' and all that, but I
    wouldn't have that old skunk goin' around sayin' I took advantage
    of my position to rob him of his son for anything on earth.  I
    despise him too much to give him that much satisfaction.  And yet
    there I am, and the case'll come up afore me.  What'll I do, Jed?
    Shall I resign?  Help me out.  I'm about crazy.  Shall I heave up
    the job?  Shall I quit?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed put down the brush and the sailor man.  He rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he drawled, after a moment.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I shan't, eh?  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause you don't know how, Sam.  It always seemed to me that it
    took a lot of practice to be a quitter.  You never practiced."
</p>
<p>
    "Thanks.  All right, then, I'm to hang on, I suppose, and take my
    medicine.  If that's all the advice you've got to give me, I might
    as well have stayed at home.  But I tell you this, Jed Winslow: If
    I'd realized&#8212;if I'd thought about the Leander Babbitt case comin'
    up afore me on that Board I never would have accepted the
    appointment.  When you and I were talkin' here the other night it's
    queer that neither of us thought of it. . . .  Eh?  What are you
    lookin at me like that for?  You don't mean to tell me that YOU DID
    think of it?  Did you?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said.  "I thought of it."
</p>
<p>
    "You DID!  Well, I swear!  Then why in thunder didn't you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He was interrupted.  The bell attached to the door of the outer
    shop rang.  The maker of windmills rose jerkily to his feet.
    Captain Sam made a gesture of impatience.
</p>
<p>
    "Get rid of your customer and come back here soon as you can," he
    ordered.  Having commanded a steamer before he left the sea and
    become a banker, the captain usually ordered rather than requested.
    "Hurry all you can.  I ain't half through talkin' with you.  For
    the land sakes, MOVE!  Of all the deliberate, slow travelin'&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He did not finish his sentence, nor did Winslow, who had started
    toward the door, have time to reach it.  The door was opened and a
    short, thickset man, with a leathery face and a bristling yellow-
    white chin beard, burst into the room.  At the sight of its
    occupants he uttered a grunt of satisfaction and his bushy brows
    were drawn together above his little eyes, the latter a washed-out
    gray and set very close together.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" he snarled, vindictively.  "So you BE here.  Gabe Bearse
    said you was, but I thought probably he was lyin', as usual.  Did
    he lie about the other thing, that's what I've come here to find
    out?  Sam Hunniwell, have you been put on that Draft Exemption
    Board?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said, curtly, "I have."
</p>
<p>
    The man trembled all over.
</p>
<p>
    "You have?" he cried, raising his voice almost to a scream.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I have.  What's it matter to you, Phin Babbitt?  Seems to
    have het you up some, that or somethin' else."
</p>
<p>
    "Het me up!  By&#8212;"  Mr. Phineas Babbitt swore steadily for a full
    minute.  When he stopped for breath Jed Winslow, who had stepped
    over and was looking out of the window, uttered an observation.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm afraid I made a mistake, changin' that sign," he said,
    musingly.  "I cal'late I'll make another: 'Prayer meetin's must be
    held outside.'"
</p>
<p>
    "By&#8212;," began Mr. Babbitt again, but this time it was Captain Sam
    who interrupted.  The captain occasionally swore at other people,
    but he was not accustomed to be sworn at.  He, too, began to "heat
    up." He rose to his feet.
</p>
<p>
    "That'll do, Babbitt," he commanded.  "What's the matter with you?
    Is it me you're cussin'?  Because if it is&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The little Babbitt eyes snapped defiance.
</p>
<p>
    "If it is, what?" he demanded.  But before the captain could reply
    Winslow, turning away from the window, did so for him.
</p>
<p>
    "If it is, I should say 'twas a pretty complete job," he drawled.
    "I don't know when I've heard fewer things left out.  You have
    reason to be proud, both of you.  And now, Phineas," he went on,
    "what's it all about?  What's the matter?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Babbitt waved his fists again, preparatory to another outburst.
    Jed laid a big hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't seem to me time for the benediction yet, Phineas," he said.
    "Ought to preach your sermon or sing a hymn first, seems so.  What
    did you come here for?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas Babbitt's hard gray eyes looked up into the big brown ones
    gazing mildly down upon him.  His gaze shifted and his tone when he
    next spoke was a trifle less savage.
</p>
<p>
    "He knows well enough what I came here for," he growled, indicating
    Hunniwell with a jerk of his thumb.  "He knows that just as well as
    he knows why he had himself put on that Exemption Board."
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't have myself put there," declared the captain.  "The job
    was wished on me.  Lord knows I didn't want it.  I was just tellin'
    Jed here that very thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Wished on you nothin'!  You planned to get it and you worked to
    get it and I know why you did it, too.  'Twas to get another crack
    at me.  'Twas to play another dirty trick on me like the one you
    played that cheated me out of the post office.  You knew they'd
    drafted my boy and you wanted to make sure he didn't get clear.
    You&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "That'll do!"  Captain Hunniwell seized him by the shoulder.
    "That's enough," cried the captain.  "Your boy had nothin' to do
    with it.  I never thought of his name bein' drawn when I said I'd
    accept the job."
</p>
<p>
    "You lie!"
</p>
<p>
    "WHAT?  Why, you little sawed-off, dried-up, sassy son of a sea
    cook!  I'll&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow's lanky form was interposed between the pair; and his slow,
    gentle drawl made itself heard.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sorry to interrupt the experience meetin'," he said, "but I'VE
    got a call to testify and I feel the spirit aworkin'.  Set down
    again, Sam, will you please.  Phineas, you set down over there.
    Please set down, both of you.  Sam, as a favor to me&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But the captain was not in a favor-extending mood.  He glowered at
    his adversary and remained standing.
</p>
<p>
    "Phin&#8212;" begged Winslow.  But Mr. Babbitt, although a trifle paler
    than when he entered the shop, was not more yielding.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm particular who I set down along of," he declared.  "I'd as
    soon set down with a&#8212;a rattlesnake as I would with some humans."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam was not pale, far from it.
</p>
<p>
    "Skunks are always afraid of snakes, they tell me," he observed,
    tartly.  "A rattlesnake's honest, anyhow, and he ain't afraid to
    bite.  He ain't all bad smell and nothin' else."
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt's bristling chin beard quivered with inarticulate hatred.
    Winslow sighed resignedly.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he asked, "you don't mind the other&#8212;er&#8212;critter in the
    menagerie sittin', do you?  Now&#8212;now&#8212;now, just a minute," he
    pleaded, as his two companions showed symptoms of speaking
    simultaneously.  "Just a minute; let me say a word.  Phineas, I
    judge the only reason you have for objectin' to the captain's bein'
    on the Exemption Board is on account of your son, ain't it?  It's
    just on Leander's account?"
</p>
<p>
    But before the furious Mr. Babbitt could answer there came another
    interruption.  The bell attached to the door of the outer shop rang
    once more.  Jed, who had accepted his own invitation to sit, rose
    again with a groan.
</p>
<p>
    "Now I wonder who THAT is?" he drawled, in mild surprise.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell's frayed patience, never noted for long
    endurance, snapped again.  "Gracious king! go and find out," he
    roared.  "Whoever 'tis 'll die of old age before you get there."
</p>
<p>
    The slow smile drifted over Mr. Winslow's face.  "Probably if I
    wait and give 'em a chance they'll come in here and have apoplexy
    instead," he said.  "That seems to be the fashionable disease this
    afternoon.  They won't stay out there and be lonesome; they'll come
    in here where it's private and there's a crowd.  Eh?  Yes, here
    they come."
</p>
<p>
    But the newest visitor did not come, like the others, uninvited
    into the "private" room.  Instead he knocked on its door.  When
    Winslow opened it he saw a small boy with a yellow envelope in his
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Josiah," hailed Jed, genially.  "How's the president of the
    Western Union these days?"
</p>
<p>
    The boy grinned bashfully and opined the magnate just mentioned was
    "all right."  Then he added:
</p>
<p>
    "Is Mr. Babbitt here?  Mr. Bearse&#8212;Mr. Gabe Bearse&#8212;is over at the
    office and he said he saw Mr. Babbitt come in here."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, he's here.  Want to see him, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I've got a telegram for him."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Babbitt himself came forward and took the yellow envelope.
    After absently turning it over several times, as so many people do
    when they receive an unexpected letter or message, he tore it open.
</p>
<p>
    Winslow and Captain Sam, watching him, saw his face, to which the
    color had returned in the last few minutes, grow white again.  He
    staggered a little.  Jed stepped toward him.
</p>
<p>
    "What is it, Phin?" he asked.  "Somebody dead or&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt waved him away.  "No," he gasped, chokingly.  "No, let me
    be.  I'm&#8212;I'm all right."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam, a little conscience-stricken, came forward.  "Are you
    sick, Phin?" he asked.  "Is there anything I can do?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas glowered at him.  "Yes," he snarled between his clenched
    teeth, "you can mind your own darned business."
</p>
<p>
    Then, turning to the boy who had brought the message, he ordered:
    "You get out of here."
</p>
<p>
    The frightened youngster scuttled away and Babbitt, the telegram
    rattling in his shaking hand, followed him.  The captain, hurrying
    to the window, saw him go down the walk and along the road in the
    direction of his store.  He walked like a man stricken.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam turned back again.  "Now what in time was in that
    telegram?" he demanded.  Jed, standing with his back toward him and
    looking out of the window on the side of the shop toward the sea,
    did not answer.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you hear me?" asked the captain.  "That telegram struck him
    like a shock of paralysis.  He went all to pieces.  What on earth
    do you suppose was in it?  Eh?  Why don't you say somethin'?  YOU
    don't know what was in it, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow shook his head.  "No," he answered.  "I don't know's I do."
</p>
<p>
    "You don't know as you do?  Well, do you GUESS you do?  Jed
    Winslow, what have you got up your sleeve?"
</p>
<p>
    The proprietor of the windmill shop slowly turned and faced him.
    "I don't know's there's anything there, Sam," he answered, "but&#8212;
    but I shouldn't be much surprised if that telegram was from
    Leander."
</p>
<p>
    "Leander?  Leander Babbitt?  What . . .  Eh?  What in thunder do
    YOU want?"
</p>
<p>
    The last question was directed toward the window on the street side
    of the shop.  Mr. Gabriel Bearse was standing on the outside of
    that window, energetically thumping on the glass.
</p>
<p>
    "Open her up!  Open her up!" commanded Gabe.  "I've got somethin'
    to tell you."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam opened the window.  Gabriel's face was aglow with
    excitement.  "Say!  Say!" he cried.  "Did he tell you?  Did he tell
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Did who tell what?" demanded the captain.
</p>
<p>
    "Did Phin Babbitt tell you what was in that telegram he just got?
    What did he say when he read it?  Did he swear?  I bet he did!  If
    that telegram wan't some surprise to old Babbitt, then&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Do you know what 'twas&#8212;what the telegram was?"
</p>
<p>
    "Do I?  You bet you I do!  And I'm the only one in this town except
    Phin and Jim Bailey that does know.  I was in the telegraph office
    when Jim took it over the wire.  I see Jim was pretty excited.
    'Well,' says he, 'if this won't be some jolt to old Phin!' he says.
    'What will?' says I.  'Why,' says he&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "What was it?" demanded Captain Sam.  "You're dyin' to tell us, a
    blind man could see that.  Get it off your chest and save your
    life.  What was it?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse leaned forward and whispered.  There was no real reason
    why he should whisper, but doing so added a mysterious,
    confidential tang, so to speak, to the value of his news.
</p>
<p>
    "'Twas from Leander&#8212;from Phin's own boy, Leander Babbitt, 'twas.
    'Twas from him, up in Boston and it went somethin' like this: 'Have
    enlisted in the infantry.  Made up my mind best thing to do.  Will
    not be back.  Have written particulars.'  That was it, or pretty
    nigh it.  Leander's enlisted.  Never waited for no Exemption Board
    nor nothin', but went up and enlisted on his own hook without
    tellin' a soul he was goin' to.  That's the way Bailey and me
    figger it up.  Say, ain't that some news?  Godfreys, I must hustle
    back to the post office and tell the gang afore anybody else gets
    ahead of me.  So long!"
</p>
<p>
    He hurried away on his joyful errand.  Captain Hunniwell closed the
    window and turned to face his friend.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you suppose that's true, Jed?" he asked.  "Do you suppose it
    CAN be true?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Shouldn't be surprised," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Good gracious king!  Do you mean the boy went off up to Boston on
    his own hook, as that what's-his-name&#8212;Gab&#8212;says, and volunteered
    and got himself enlisted into the army?"
</p>
<p>
    "Shouldn't wonder, Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, my gracious king!  Why&#8212;why&#8212;no wonder old Babbitt looked as
    if the main topsail yard had fell on him.  Tut, tut, tut!  Well, I
    declare!  Now what do you suppose put him up to doin' that?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow sat down in his low chair again and picked up the wooden
    sailor and the paint brush.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Sam," he said, slowly, "Leander's a pretty good boy."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I suppose he is, but he's Phin Babbitt's son."
</p>
<p>
    "I know, but don't it seem to you as if some sorts of fathers was
    like birthmarks and bow legs; they come early in life and a feller
    ain't to blame for havin' 'em?  Sam, you ain't sorry the boy's
    volunteered, are you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Sorry!  I should say not!  For one thing his doin' it makes my job
    on the Exemption Board a mighty sight easier.  There won't be any
    row there with Phineas now."
</p>
<p>
    "No-o, I thought 'twould help that.  But that wan't the whole
    reason, Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "Reason for what?  What do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
    "I mean that wan't my whole reason for tellin' Leander he'd better
    volunteer, better go up to Boston and enlist, same as he did.  That
    was part, but 'twan't all."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam's eyes and mouth opened.  He stared at the speaker in
    amazement.
</p>
<p>
    "You told him to volunteer?" he repeated.  "You told him to go to
    Boston and&#8212;  YOU did?  What on earth?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's brush moved slowly down the wooden legs of his sailor man.
</p>
<p>
    "Leander and I are pretty good friends," he explained.  "I like him
    and he&#8212;er&#8212;hum&#8212;I'm afraid that paint's kind of thick.  Cal'late
    I'll have to thin it a little."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam condemned the paint to an eternal blister.
</p>
<p>
    "Go on! go on!" he commanded.  "What about you and Leander?  Finish
    her out.  Can't you see you've got my head whirlin' like one of
    those windmills of yours?  Finish her OUT!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh!" he said.  "Well, Leander's been comin' in here pretty
    frequent and we've talked about his affairs a good deal.  He's
    always wanted to enlist ever since the war broke out."
</p>
<p>
    "He HAS?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, sartin.  Just the same as you would, or&#8212;or I hope I would,
    if I was young and&#8212;and," with a wistful smile, "different, and
    likely to be any good to Uncle Sam.  Yes, Leander's been anxious to
    go to war, but his dad was so set against it all and kept hollerin'
    so about the boy's bein' needed in the store, that Leander didn't
    hardly know what to do.  But then when he was drawn on the draft
    list he came in here and he and I had a long talk.  'Twas
    yesterday, after you'd told me about bein' put on the Board, you
    know.  I could see the trouble there'd be between you and Phineas
    and&#8212;and&#8212;well, you see, Sam, I just kind of wanted that boy to
    volunteer.  I&#8212;I don't know why, but&#8212;"  He looked up from his work
    and stared dreamily out of the window.  "I guess maybe 'twas
    because I've been wishin' so that I could go myself&#8212;or&#8212;do
    SOMETHIN' that was some good.  So Leander and I talked and finally
    he said, 'Well, by George, I WILL go.'  And&#8212;and&#8212;well, I guess
    that's all; he went, you see."
</p>
<p>
    The captain drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>
    "He went," he repeated.  "And you knew he'd gone?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I didn't know, but I kind of guessed."
</p>
<p>
    "You guessed, and yet all the time I've been here you haven't said
    a word about it till this minute."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I didn't think 'twas much use sayin' until I knew."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, my gracious king, Jed Winslow, you beat all my goin' to sea!
    But you've helped Uncle Sam to a good soldier and you've helped me
    out of a nasty row.  For my part I'm everlastin' obliged to you, I
    am so."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked pleased but very much embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho," he exclaimed, hastily, "'twan't anything.  Oh, say,"
    hastily changing the subject, "I've got some money 'round here
    somewheres I thought maybe you'd take to the bank and deposit for
    me next time you went, if 'twan't too much trouble."
</p>
<p>
    "Trouble?  Course 'tain't any trouble.  Where is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Winslow put down his work and began to hunt.  From one drawer of
    his work bench, amid nails, tools and huddles of papers, he
    produced a small bundle of banknotes; from another drawer another
    bundle.  These, however, did not seem to satisfy him entirely.  At
    last, after a good deal of very deliberate search, he unearthed
    more paper currency from the pocket of a dirty pair of overalls
    hanging on a nail, and emptied a heap of silver and coppers from a
    battered can on the shelf.  Captain Hunniwell, muttering to
    himself, watched the collecting process.  When it was completed, he
    asked:
</p>
<p>
    "Is this all?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Yes, I guess 'tis.  I can't seem to find any more just now.
    Maybe another batch'll turn up later.  If it does I'll keep it till
    next time."
</p>
<p>
    The captain, suppressing his emotions, hastily counted the money.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you any idea how much there is here?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "No, I don't know's I have.  There's been quite consider'ble comin'
    in last fortni't or so.  Summer folks been payin' bills and one
    thing or 'nother.  Might be forty or fifty dollars, I presume
    likely."
</p>
<p>
    "Forty or fifty!  Nearer a hundred and fifty!  And you keep it
    stuffed around in every junk hole from the roof to the cellar.
    Wonder to me you don't light your pipe with it.  I shouldn't wonder
    if you did.  How many times have I told you to deposit your money
    every three days anyhow?  How many times?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow seemed to reflect.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't know, Sam," he admitted.  "Good many, I will give in.  But&#8212;
    but, you see, Sam, if&#8212;if I take it to the bank I'm liable to
    forget I've got it.  Long's it's round here somewheres I&#8212;why, I
    know where 'tis and&#8212;and it's handy.  See, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    The captain shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed Winslow," he declared, "as I said to you just now you beat all
    my goin' to sea.  I can't make you out.  When I see how you act
    with money and business, and how you let folks take advantage of
    you, then I think you're a plain dum fool.  And yet when you bob up
    and do somethin' like gettin' Leander Babbitt to volunteer and
    gettin' me out of that row with his father, then&#8212;well, then, I'm
    ready to swear you're as wise as King Solomon ever was.  You're a
    puzzle to me, Jed.  What are you, anyway&#8212;the dum fool or King
    Solomon?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked meditatively over his spectacles.  The slow smile
    twitched the corners of his lips.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Sam," he drawled, "if you put it to vote at town meetin' I
    cal'late the majority'd be all one way.  But, I don't know"&#8212;; he
    paused, and then added, "I don't know, Sam, but it's just as well
    as 'tis.  A King Solomon down here in Orham would be an awful
    lonesome cuss."

<h2>
    CHAPTER III
</h2>
<p>
    Upon a late September day forty-nine years and some months before
    that upon which Gabe Bearse came to Jed Winslow's windmill shop in
    Orham with the news of Leander Babbitt's enlistment, Miss Floretta
    Thompson came to that village to teach the "downstairs" school.
    Miss Thompson was an orphan.  Her father had kept a small drug
    store in a town in western Massachusetts.  Her mother had been a
    clergyman's daughter.  Both had died when she was in her 'teens.
    Now, at twenty, she came to Cape Cod, pale, slim, with a wealth of
    light brown hair and a pair of large, dreamy brown eyes.  Her taste
    in dress was peculiar, even eccentric, and Orham soon discovered
    that she, herself, was also somewhat eccentric.
</p>
<p>
    As a schoolteacher she was not an unqualified success.  The
    "downstairs" curriculum was not extensive nor very exacting, but it
    was supposed to impart to the boys and girls of from seven to
    twelve a rudimentary knowledge of the three R's and of geography.
    In the first two R's, "readin' and 'ritin'," Miss Thompson was
    proficient.  She wrote a flowery Spencerian, which was beautifully
    "shaded" and looked well on the blackboard, and reading was the
    dissipation of her spare moments.  The third "R," 'rithmetic, she
    loathed.
</p>
<p>
    Youth, even at the ages of from seven to twelve, is only too
    proficient in learning to evade hard work.  The fact that Teacher
    took no delight in traveling the prosaic highways of addition,
    multiplication and division, but could be easily lured to wander
    the flowery lanes of romantic fiction, was soon grasped by the
    downstairs pupils.  The hour set for recitation by the first class
    in arithmetic was often and often monopolized by a hold-over of the
    first class in reading, while Miss Floretta, artfully spurred by
    questions asked by the older scholars, rhapsodized on the beauties
    of James Fenimore Cooper's "Uncas," or Dickens' "Little Nell," or
    Scott's "Ellen."  Some of us antiques, then tow-headed little
    shavers in the front seats, can still remember Miss Floretta's
    rendition of the lines:
</p>
<p>
    "And Saxon&#8212;I am Roderick Dhu!"
</p>
<p>
    The extremely genteel, not to say ladylike, elocution of the
    Highland chief and the indescribable rising inflection and emphasis
    on the "I."
</p>
<p>
    These literary rambles had their inevitable effect, an effect
    noted, after a time, and called to the attention of the school
    committee by old Captain Lycurgus Batcheldor, whose two
    grandchildren were among the ramblers.
</p>
<p>
    "Say," demanded Captain Lycurgus, "how old does a young-one have to
    be afore it's supposed to know how much four times eight is?  My
    Sarah's Nathan is pretty nigh ten and HE don't know it.  Gave me
    three answers he did; first that 'twas forty-eight, then that 'twas
    eighty-four and then that he'd forgot what 'twas.  But I noticed he
    could tell me a whole string about some feller called Lockintar or
    Lochinvar or some such outlandish name, and not only his name but
    where he came from, which was out west somewheres.  A poetry piece
    'twas; Nate said the teacher'd been speakin' it to 'em.  I ain't
    got no objection to speakin' pieces, but I do object to bein' told
    that four times eight is eighty-four, 'specially when I'm buyin'
    codfish at eight cents a pound.  I ain't on the school committee,
    but if I was&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    So the committee investigated and when Miss Thompson's year was up
    and the question arose as to her re-engagement, there was
    considerable hesitancy.  But the situation was relieved in a most
    unexpected fashion.  Thaddeus Winslow, first mate on the clipper
    ship, "Owner's Favorite," at home from a voyage to the Dutch East
    Indies, fell in love with Miss Floretta, proposed, was accepted and
    married her.
</p>
<p>
    It was an odd match: Floretta, pale, polite, impractical and
    intensely romantic; Thad, florid, rough and to the point.  Yet the
    married pair seemed to be happy together.  Winslow went to sea on
    several voyages and, four years after the marriage, remained at
    home for what, for him, was a long time.  During that time a child,
    a boy, was born.
</p>
<p>
    The story of the christening of that child is one of Orham's pet
    yarns even to this day.  It seems that there was a marked
    disagreement concerning the name to be given him.  Captain Thad had
    had an Uncle Edgar, who had been very kind to him when a boy.  The
    captain wished to name his own youngster after this uncle.  But
    Floretta's heart was set upon "Wilfred," her favorite hero of
    romance being Wilfred of Ivanhoe.  The story is that the parents
    being no nearer an agreement on the great question, Floretta made a
    proposal of compromise.  She proposed that her husband take up his
    stand by the bedroom window and the first male person he saw
    passing on the sidewalk below, the name of that person should be
    given to their offspring; a sporting proposition certainly.  But
    the story goes on to detract a bit from the sporting element by
    explaining that Mrs. Winslow was expecting a call at that hour from
    the Baptist minister, and the Baptist minister's Christian name was
    "Clarence," which, if not quite as romantic as Wilfred, is by no
    means common and prosaic.  Captain Thad, who had not been informed
    of the expected ministerial call and was something of a sport
    himself, assented to the arrangement.  It was solemnly agreed that
    the name of the first male passer-by should be the name of the new
    Winslow.  The captain took up his post of observation at the window
    and waited.
</p>
<p>
    He did not have to wait long.  Unfortunately for romance, the
    Reverend Clarence was detained at the home of another parishioner a
    trifle longer than he had planned and the first masculine to pass
    the Winslow home was old Jedidah Wingate, the fish peddler.  Mrs.
    Diadama Busteed, who was acting as nurse in the family and had been
    sworn in as witness to the agreement between husband and wife,
    declared to the day of her death that that death was hastened by
    the shock to her nervous and moral system caused by Captain Thad's
    language when old Jedidah hove in sight.  He vowed over and over
    again that he would be everlastingly condemned if he would label a
    young-one of his with such a crashety-blank-blanked outrage of a
    name as "Jedidah."  "Jedidiah" was bad enough, but there WERE a few
    Jedidiahs in Ostable County, whereas there was but one Jedidah.
    Mrs. Winslow, who did not fancy Jedidah any more than her husband
    did, wept; Captain Thad's profanity impregnated the air with
    brimstone.  But they had solemnly sworn to the agreement and Mrs.
    Busteed had witnessed it, and an oath is an oath.  Besides, Mrs.
    Winslow was inclined to think the whole matter guided by Fate, and,
    being superstitious as well as romantic, feared dire calamity if
    Fate was interfered with.  It ended in a compromise and, a
    fortnight later, the Reverend Clarence, keeping his countenance
    with difficulty, christened a red-faced and protesting infant
    "Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    Jedidah Edgar Wilfred grew up.  At first he was called "Edgar" by
    his father and "Wilfred" by his mother.  His teachers, day school
    and Sunday school, called him one or the other as suited their
    individual fancies.  But his schoolmates and playfellows, knowing
    that he hated the name above all else on earth, gleefully hailed
    him as "Jedidah."  By the time he was ten he was "Jed" Winslow
    beyond hope of recovery.  Also it was settled locally that he was
    "queer"&#8212;not "cracked" or "lacking," which would have implied that
    his brain was affected&#8212;but just "queer," which meant that his ways
    of thinking and acting were different from those of Orham in
    general.
</p>
<p>
    His father, Captain Thaddeus, died when Jed was fifteen, just
    through the grammar school and ready to enter the high.  He did not
    enter; instead, the need of money being pressing, he went to work
    in one of the local stores, selling behind the counter.  If his
    father had lived he would, probably, have gone away after finishing
    high school and perhaps, if by that time the mechanical ability
    which he possessed had shown itself, he might even have gone to
    some technical school or college.  In that case Jed Winslow's
    career might have been very, very different.  But instead he went
    to selling groceries, boots, shoes, dry goods and notions for Mr.
    Seth Wingate, old Jedidah's younger brother.
</p>
<p>
    As a grocery clerk Jed was not a success, neither did he shine as a
    clerk in the post office, nor as an assistant to the local
    expressman.  In desperation he began to learn the carpenter's trade
    and, because he liked to handle tools, did pretty well at it.  But
    he continued to be "queer" and his absent-minded dreaminess was in
    evidence even then.
</p>
<p>
    "I snum I don't know what to make of him," declared Mr. Abijah
    Mullett, who was the youth's "boss."  "Never know just what he's
    goin' to do or just what he's goin' to say.  I says to him
    yesterday: 'Jed,' says I, 'you do pretty well with tools and wood,
    considerin' what little experience you've had.  Did Cap'n Thad
    teach you some or did you pick it up yourself?'  He never answered
    for a minute or so, seemed to be way off dreamin' in the next
    county somewheres.  Then he looked at me with them big eyes of his
    and he drawled out: 'Comes natural to me, Mr. Mullett, I guess,' he
    says.  'There seems to be a sort of family feelin' between my head
    and a chunk of wood.'  Now what kind of an answer was that, I want
    to know!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed worked at carpentering for a number of years, sometimes going
    as far away as Ostable to obtain employment.  And then his mother
    was seized with the illness from which, so she said, she never
    recovered.  It is true that Doctor Parker, the Orham physician,
    declared that she had recovered, or might recover if she cared to.
    Which of the pair was right does not really matter.  At all events
    Mrs. Winslow, whether she recovered or not, never walked abroad
    again.  She was "up and about," as they say in Orham, and did some
    housework, after a fashion, but she never again set foot across the
    granite doorstep of the Winslow cottage.  Probably the poor woman's
    mind was slightly affected; it is charitable to hope that it was.
    It seems the only reasonable excuse for the oddity of her behavior
    during the last twenty years of her life, for her growing
    querulousness and selfishness and for the exacting slavery in which
    she kept her only son.
</p>
<p>
    During those twenty years whatever ambition Jedidah Edgar Wilfred
    may once have had was thoroughly crushed.  His mother would not
    hear of his leaving her to find better work or to obtain promotion.
    She needed him, she wailed; he was her life, her all; she should
    die if he left her.  Some hard-hearted townspeople, Captain
    Hunniwell among them, disgustedly opined that, in view of such a
    result, Jed should be forcibly kidnaped forthwith for the general
    betterment of the community.  But Jed himself never rebelled.  He
    cheerfully gave up his youth and early middle age to his mother and
    waited upon her, ran her errands, sat beside her practically every
    evening and read romance after romance aloud for her benefit.  And
    his "queerness" developed, as under such circumstances it was bound
    to do.
</p>
<p>
    Money had to be earned and, as the invalid would not permit him to
    leave her to earn it, it was necessary to find ways of earning it
    at home.  Jed did odd jobs of carpentering and cabinet making, went
    fishing sometimes, worked in gardens between times, did almost
    anything, in fact, to bring in the needed dollars.  And when he was
    thirty-eight years old he made and sold his first "Cape Cod Winslow
    windmill," the forerunner of the thousands to follow.  That mill,
    made in some of his rare idle moments and given to the child of a
    wealthy summer visitor, made a hit.  The child liked it and other
    children wanted mills just like it.  Then "grown-ups" among the
    summer folk took up the craze.  "Winslow mills" became the fad.
    Jed built his little shop, or the first installment of it.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Floretta Winslow died when her son was forty.  A merciful
    release, Captain Sam and the rest called it, but to Jed it was a
    stunning shock.  He had no one to take care of now except himself
    and he did not know what to do.  He moped about like a deserted
    cat.  Finally he decided that he could not live in the old house
    where he was born and had lived all his life.  He expressed his
    feelings concerning that house to his nearest friend, practically
    his sole confidant, Captain Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't somehow seem to stand it, Sam," he said, solemnly.  "I
    can't stay in that house alone any longer, it's&#8212;it's too
    sociable."
</p>
<p>
    The captain, who had expected almost anything but that, stared at
    him.
</p>
<p>
    "Sociable!" he repeated.  "You're sailin' stern first, Jed.
    Lonesome's what you mean, of course."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he drawled, "I mean sociable.  There's too many boys in
    there, for one thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Boys!"  Captain Sam was beginning to be really alarmed now.
    "Boys!  Say&#8212;say, Jed Winslow, you come along home to dinner with
    me.  I bet you've forgot to eat anything for the last day or so&#8212;
    been inventin' some new kind of whirlagig or other&#8212;and your empty
    stomach's gone to your head and made it dizzy.  Boys!  Gracious
    king!  Come on home with me."
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled his slow smile.  "I don't mean real boys, Sam," he
    explained.  "I mean me&#8212;I'm the boys.  Nights now when I'm walkin'
    around in that house alone I meet myself comin' round every corner.
    Me when I was five, comin' out of the buttery with a cooky in each
    fist; and me when I was ten sittin' studyin' my lesson book in the
    corner; and me when I was fifteen, just afore Father died, sittin'
    all alone thinkin' what I'd do when I went to Boston Tech same as
    he said he was cal'latin' to send me.  Then&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He paused and lapsed into one of his fits of musing.  His friend
    drew a breath of relief.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh!" he exclaimed.  "Well, I don't mind your meetin' yourself.  I
    thought first you'd gone off your head, blessed if I didn't.
    You're a queer critter, Jed.  Get those funny notions from readin'
    so many books, I guess likely.  Meetin' yourself!  What an idea
    that is!  I suppose you mean that, bein' alone in that house where
    you've lived since you was born, you naturally get to thinkin'
    about what used to be."
</p>
<p>
    Jed stared wistfully at the back of a chair.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," he murmured, "and what might have been&#8212;and&#8212;and ain't."
</p>
<p>
    The captain nodded.  Of all the people in Orham he, he prided
    himself, was the only one who thoroughly understood Jed Winslow.
    And sometimes he did partially understand him; this was one of the
    times.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now&#8212;now," he said, hastily, "don't you get to frettin'
    yourself about your not amountin' to anything and all that.  You've
    got a nice little trade of your own buildin' up here.  What more do
    you want?  We can't all be&#8212;er&#8212;Know-it-alls like Shakespeare, or&#8212;
    or rich as Standard Oil Companies, can we?  Look here, what do you
    waste your time goin' back twenty-five years and meetin' yourself
    for?  Why don't you look ahead ten or fifteen and try to meet
    yourself then?  You may be a millionaire, a&#8212;er&#8212;windmill trust or
    somethin' of that kind, by that time.  Eh?  Ha, ha!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "When I meet myself lookin' like a millionaire," he observed,
    gravely, "I'll have to do the way you do at your bank, Sam&#8212;call in
    somebody to identify me."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam laughed.  "Well, anyhow," he said, "don't talk any more
    foolishness about not livin' in your own house.  If I was you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow interrupted.  "Sam," he said, "the way to find out what
    you would do if you was me is to make sure WHAT you'd do&#8212;and then
    do t'other thing, or somethin' worse."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed, be reasonable."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked over his spectacles.  "Sam," he drawled, "if I was
    reasonable I wouldn't be me."
</p>
<p>
    And he lived no longer in the old house.  Having made up his mind,
    he built a small two-room addition to his workshop and lived in
    that.  Later he added a sleeping room&#8212;a sort of loft&#8212;and a little
    covered porch on the side toward the sea.  Here, in pleasant summer
    twilights or on moonlight nights, he sat and smoked.  He had a good
    many callers and but few real friends.  Most of the townspeople
    liked him, but almost all considered him a joke, an oddity, a
    specimen to be pointed out to those of the summer people who were
    looking for "types."  A few, like Mr. Gabriel Bearse, who
    distinctly did NOT understand him and who found his solemn
    suggestions and pointed repartee irritating at times, were inclined
    to refer to him in these moments of irritation as "town crank."
    But they did not really mean it when they said it.  And some
    others, like Leander Babbitt or Captain Hunniwell, came to ask his
    advice on personal matters, although even they patronized him just
    a little.  He had various nicknames, "Shavings" being the most
    popular.
</p>
<p>
    His peculiar business, the making of wooden mills, toys and weather
    vanes, had grown steadily.  Now he shipped many boxes of these to
    other seashore and mountain resorts.  He might have doubled his
    output had he chosen to employ help or to enlarge his plant, but he
    would not do so.  He had rented the old Winslow house furnished
    once to a summer tenant, but he never did so again, although he had
    many opportunities.  He lived alone in the addition to the little
    workshop, cooking his own meals, making his own bed, and sewing on
    his own buttons.
</p>
<p>
    And on the day following that upon which Leander Babbitt enrolled
    to fight for Uncle Sam, Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow was forty-
    five years old.
</p>
<p>
    He was conscious of that fact when he arose.  It was a pleasant
    morning, the sun was rising over the notched horizon of the
    tumbling ocean, the breeze was blowing, the surf on the bar was
    frothing and roaring cheerily&#8212;and it was his birthday.  The
    morning, the sunrise, the surf and all the rest were pleasant to
    contemplate&#8212;his age was not.  So he decided not to contemplate it.
    Instead he went out and hoisted at the top of the short pole on the
    edge of the bluff the flag he had set there on the day when the
    United States declared war against the Hun.  He hoisted it every
    fine morning and he took it in every night.
</p>
<p>
    He stood for a moment, watching the red, white and blue flapping
    bravely in the morning sunshine, then he went back into his little
    kitchen at the rear of the workshop and set about cooking his
    breakfast.  The kitchen was about as big as a good-sized packing
    box and Jed, standing over the oilstove, could reach any shelf in
    sight without moving.  He cooked his oatmeal porridge, boiled his
    egg and then sat down at the table in the next room&#8212;his combined
    living and dining-room and not very much bigger than the kitchen&#8212;
    to eat.  When he had finished, he washed the dishes, walked up to
    the post office for the mail and then, entering the workshop, took
    up the paint brush and the top sailor-man of the pile beside him
    and began work.  This, except on Sundays, was his usual morning
    routine.  It varied little, except that he occasionally sawed or
    whittled instead of painted, or, less occasionally still, boxed
    some of his wares for shipment.
</p>
<p>
    During the forenoon he had some visitors.  A group of summer people
    from the hotel came in and, after pawing over and displacing about
    half of the movable stock, bought ten or fifteen dollars' worth and
    departed.  Mr. Winslow had the satisfaction of hearing them burst
    into a shout of laughter as they emerged into the yard and the
    shrill voice of one of the females in the party rose above the
    hilarity with: "Isn't he the WEIRDEST thing!"  And an accompanying
    male voice appraised him as "Some guy, believe me!  S-o-o-me guy!"
    Jed winced a little, but he went on with his painting.  On one's
    forty-fifth birthday one has acquired or should have acquired a
    certain measure of philosophical resignation.
</p>
<p>
    Other customers or lookers came and went.  Maud Hunniwell, Captain
    Sam's daughter, dropped in on her way to the post office.  The
    captain was a widower and Maud was his only child.  She was,
    therefore, more than the apple of his eye, she was a whole orchard
    of apples.  She was eighteen, pretty and vivacious, and her father
    made a thorough job of spoiling her.  Not that the spoiling had
    injured her to any great extent, it had not as yet, but that was
    Captain Sam's good luck.  Maud was wearing a new dress&#8212;she had a
    new one every week or so&#8212;and she came into the windmill shop to
    show it.  Of course she would have denied that that was the reason
    for her coming, but the statement stands, nevertheless.  She and
    Jed were great chums and had been since she could walk.  She liked
    him, took his part when she heard him criticized or made fun of,
    and was always prettily confidential and friendly when they were
    alone together.  Of course there was a touch of superiority and
    patronage in her friendship.  She should not be blamed for this;
    all Orham, consciously or unconsciously, patronized Jed Winslow.
</p>
<p>
    She came into the inner shop and sat down upon the same upturned
    box upon which her father had sat the afternoon before.  Her first
    remark, after "good mornings" had been exchanged, was concerning
    the "Private" sign on the inner side of the door.
</p>
<p>
    "What in the world have you put that sign inside here for?" she
    demanded.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow explained, taking his own deliberate time in making the
    explanation.  Miss Hunniwell wrinkled her dainty upturned nose and
    burst into a trill of laughter.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, that's lovely," she declared, "and just like you, besides.
    And do you think Gabe Bearse will go back into the other room when
    he sees it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked dreamily over his spectacles at the sign.  "I don't
    know," he drawled.  "If I thought he'd go wherever that sign was I
    ain't sure but I'd tack it on the cover of the well out in the yard
    yonder."
</p>
<p>
    His fair visitor laughed again.  "Why, Jed," she exclaimed.  "You
    wouldn't want to drown him, would you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed seemed to reflect.  "No-o," he answered, slowly, "don't know's
    I would&#8212;not in my well, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell declared that that was all nonsense.  "You wouldn't
    drown a kitten," she said.  "I know that because when Mrs.
    Nathaniel Rogers' old white cat brought all her kittens over here
    the first of this summer you wouldn't even put them out in the yard
    at night, to say nothing of drowning them.  All six and the mother
    cat stayed here and fairly swarmed over you and ate you out of
    house and home.  Father said he believed they fed at the first
    table and you were taking what was left.  It was a mercy the old
    cat decided to lead them back to the Rogers' again or I don't know
    WHAT might have become of you by this time."
</p>
<p>
    Jed seemed to be thinking; there was a reminiscent twinkle in his
    eye.
</p>
<p>
    "The old cat didn't lead 'em back," he said.  "Nathaniel took 'em
    back.  Didn't I ever tell you about that?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, you didn't.  You KNOW you didn't.  Mr. Rogers took them back?
    I can't believe it.  He told everywhere about town that he was glad
    to get rid of the whole family and, as you and the cats seemed to
    be mutually happy together, he wasn't going to disturb you.  He
    thought it was a great joke on you.  And he took them back himself?
    Why?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow rubbed his chin.  "I don't know's I'd ought to say
    anything about it," he said.  "I haven't afore.  I wouldn't
    interfere with Nate's sales for anything."
</p>
<p>
    "Sales?  Sales of what?  Oh, you mean thing!  Don't be so
    provoking!  Tell me the whole story this minute."
</p>
<p>
    Jed painted a moment or two.  Then he said: "We-ell, Maud, you see
    those kittens got to be kind of a nuisance.  They was cunnin' and
    cute and all that, but they was so everlastin' lively and hungry
    that they didn't give me much of a chance.  I was only one, you
    see, and they had a majority vote every time on who should have the
    bed and the chairs and the table and one thing or 'nother.  If I
    sat down I sat on a cat.  If I went to bed I laid down on cats, and
    when I turned them out and turned in myself they came and laid down
    on ME.  I slept under fur blankets most of June.  And as for
    eatin'&#8212;  Well, every time I cooked meat or fish they sat down in a
    circle and whooped for some.  When I took it off the fire and put
    it in a plate on the table, I had to put another plate and a&#8212;a
    plane or somethin' heavy on top of it or they'd have had it sartin
    sure.  Then when I sat down to eat it they formed a circle again
    like a reg'lar band and tuned up and hollered.  Lord a-mercy, HOW
    they did holler!  And if one of the kittens stopped, run out of
    wind or got a sore throat or anything, the old cat would bite it to
    set it goin' again.  She wan't goin' to have any shirkin' in HER
    orchestra.  I ate to music, as you might say, same as I've read

    they do up to Boston restaurants.  And about everything I did eat
    was stuffed with cats' hairs.  Seemed sometimes as if those kittens
    was solid fur all the way through; they never could have shed all
    that hair from the outside.  Somebody told me that kittens never
    shed hair, 'twas only full grown cats did that.  I don't believe
    it.  Nate Rogers' old maltee never shed all that alone; allowin'
    her a half barrel, there was all of another barrel spread around
    the premises.  No-o, those cats was a good deal of a nuisance.
    Um-hm. . . .  Yes, they was. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    He paused and, apparently having forgotten that he was in the
    middle of a story, began to whistle lugubriously and to bend all
    his other energies to painting.  Miss Hunniwell, who had laughed
    until her eyes were misty, wiped them with her handkerchief and
    commanded him to go on.
</p>
<p>
    "Tell me the rest of it," she insisted.  "How did you get rid of
    them?  How did Mr. Rogers come to take them back?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, why, you see, I went over to Nate's three or four
    times and told him his cat and kittens were here and I didn't feel
    right to deprive him of 'em any longer.  He said never mind, I
    could keep 'em long as I wanted to.  I said that was about as long
    as I had kept 'em.  Then he said he didn't know's he cared about
    ever havin' 'em again; said he and his wife had kind of lost their
    taste for cats, seemed so.  I&#8212;well, I hinted that, long as the
    tribe was at my house I wan't likely to have a chance to taste much
    of anything, but it didn't seem to have much effect.  Then&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, yes; go on! go on!"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh. . . .  Then one day Nate he happened to be in here&#8212;come to
    borrow somethin', some tool seems to me 'twas&#8212;and the cats was
    climbin' round promiscuous same as usual.  And one of the summer
    women came in while he was here, wanted a mill for her little niece
    or somethin'.  And she saw one of the animals and she dropped
    everything else and sang out: 'Oh, what a beautiful kitten!  What
    unusual coloring!  May I see it?'  Course she was seein' it
    already, but I judged she meant could she handle it, so I tried to
    haul the critter loose from my leg&#8212;there was generally one or more
    of 'em shinnin' over me somewhere.  It squalled when I took hold of
    it and she says: 'Oh, it doesn't want to come, does it!  It must
    have a very affectionate disposition to be so attached to you.'
    Seemed to me 'twas attached by its claws more'n its disposition,
    but I pried it loose and handed it to her.  Then she says again,
    'What unusual colorin'!  Will you sell this one to me?  I'll give
    you five dollars for it.'"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped again.  Another reminder from Miss Hunniwell was
    necessary to make him continue.
</p>
<p>
    "And you sold one of those kittens for five dollars?" she cried.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o."
</p>
<p>
    "You didn't?  Why, you foolish man!  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
    "I never had a chance.  Afore I could say a word Nate Rogers spoke
    up and said the kittens belonged to him.  Then she saw another one
    that she hadn't seen afore and she says: 'Oh, that one has more
    unusual colorin's even than this.  I never saw such color in a
    cat.'  Course she meant ON a cat but we understood what she meant.
    'Are they a very rare breed?' she asked.  Nate said they was and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell interrupted.  "But they weren't, were they?" she
    cried.  "I never knew they were anything more than plain tabby."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.  "Nate said they was," he went on solemnly.
    "He said they were awful rare.  Then she wanted to know would he
    sell one for five dollars.  He said no, he couldn't think of it."
</p>
<p>
    "Why, the greedy old thing!"
</p>
<p>
    "And so he and she had it back and forth and finally they struck a
    bargain at seven dollars for the one that looked most like a crazy
    quilt."
</p>
<p>
    "Seven dollars for a CAT?  What color was it, for goodness' sake?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, all kinds, seemed so.  Black and white and maltee and blue and
    red and green&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Green!  What ARE you talking about?  Who ever saw a green cat?"
</p>
<p>
    "This woman saw one that was part green and she bought it.  Then
    she said she'd take it right along in her car.  Said she had a
    friend that was as loony about cats as she was and she was goin' to
    fetch her right down the very next day.  And a couple of hours
    after she'd gone Nate and his boy came back with a clothes basket
    with a board over the top and loaded in the balance of the family
    and went off with 'em.  I ain't seen a hair of 'em since&#8212;no, I
    won't say that quite, but I ain't seen THEM."
</p>
<p>
    "And didn't he give you any of the seven dollars?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o."
</p>
<p>
    "But you had been feeding those kittens and their mother for weeks."
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es."
</p>
<p>
    "But didn't you ASK for anything?"
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, I told Nate he might maybe leave one of the kittens, so's I
    could have a&#8212;er&#8212;souvenir of the visit, but he wouldn't do it.
    Said those kittens was rare and&#8212;er&#8212;precious, or words to that
    effect.  He didn't intend to let another go as cheap as he had that
    one."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh. . . . I see.  I remember now; I heard some one saying
    something, early in July, about the sign on the Rogers' front
    fence.  'Rare Cats for Sale' they said it was.  I think.  Of
    course, I never thought of THOSE kittens.  He must have sold them
    all, for the sign isn't there now."
</p>
<p>
    Jed whistled a few bars.  "I don't hardly think he's sold 'em," he
    said.  "I presume likely he's just gone out of the business."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't see why he shouldn't sell them.  Green cats ought to sell
    quickly enough, I should think.  Were they green, honest and truly,
    Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "They were that mornin'," he drawled, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
    "That morning?  What do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, you see, Maud, those kittens were into everything and over
    everything most of the time.  Four of 'em had got in here early
    afore I came downstairs that day and had been playin' hide and hoot
    amongst my paint pots.  They was green in spots, sure enough, but I
    had my doubts as to its bein' fast color."
</p>
<p>
    Maud laughed joyfully over the secret of the green pussies.
</p>
<p>
    "I wish I might have seen that woman's face after the colors began
    to wear off her 'rare' kitten," she said.
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled slightly.  "Nathan saw it," he said.  "I understood he
    had to take back the kitten and give up the seven dollars.  He
    don't hardly speak to me nowadays.  Seems to think 'twas my fault.
    I don't hardly think 'twas, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell's call lasted almost an hour.  Besides a general
    chat concerning Leander Babbit's voluntary enlistment, the subject
    which all Orham had discussed since the previous afternoon, she had
    a fresh bit of news.  The government had leased a large section of
    land along the bay at East Harniss, the next village to Orham and
    seven or eight miles distant, and there was to be a military
    aviation camp there.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, it's true!" she declared, emphatically.  "Father has known
    that the Army people have been thinking of it for some time, but it
    was really decided and the leases signed only last Saturday.  They
    will begin building the barracks and the buildings&#8212;the&#8212;oh, what
    do they call those big sheds they keep the aeroplanes in?"
</p>
<p>
    "The hangars," said Winslow, promptly.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, that's it.  They will begin building those right away."  She
    paused and looked at him curiously.  "How did you know they called
    them hangars, Jed?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, I've read about 'em in the newspapers, that's
    all. . . .  H-u-u-m. . . .  So we'll have aeroplanes flyin' around
    here pretty soon, I suppose.  Well, well!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  And there'll be lots and lots of the flying men&#8212;the what-
    do-you-call-'ems&#8212;aviators, and officers in uniform&#8212;and all sorts.
    What fun!  I'm just crazy about uniforms!"
</p>
<p>
    Her eyes snapped.  Jed, in his quiet way, seemed excited, too.  He
    was gazing absently out of the window as if he saw, in fancy, a
    procession of aircraft flying over Orham flats.
</p>
<p>
    "They'll be flyin' up out there," he said, musingly.  "And I'll see
    'em&#8212;I will.  Sho!"
</p>

<img src="shavings_files/page050.gif" width="415" height="618" border="0" alt="&quot;JED,&quot; SHE ASKED, &quot;WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE AN AVIATOR?&quot;">
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell regarded him mischievously.  "Jed," she asked,
    "would you like to be an aviator?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's answer was solemnly given.  "I'm afraid I shouldn't be much
    good at the job," he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    His visitor burst into another laugh.  He looked at her over his
    glasses.
</p>
<p>
    "What is it?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, nothing; I&#8212;I was just thinking of you in a uniform, that's
    all."
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled his slow, fleeting smile.
</p>
<p>
    "I guess likely I would be pretty funny," he admitted.  "Any
    Germans I met would probably die laughin' and that might help along
    some."
</p>
<p>
    But after Miss Hunniwell had gone he sat for some minutes gazing
    out of the window, the wistful, dreamy look on his lean, homely
    face.  Then he sighed, and resumed his painting.
</p>
<p>
    That afternoon, about half past five, he was still at his task
    when, hearing the doorbell ring, he rose and went into the front
    shop.  To his astonishment the shop was empty.  He looked about for
    the expected customer or caller, whoever he or she might be, and
    saw no one.  He stepped to the window and looked out, but there was
    no one on the steps or in the yard.  He made up his mind that he
    must have dreamed of the bell-ringing and was turning back to the
    inner room, when a voice said:
</p>
<p>
    "Please, are you the windmill man?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed started, turned again, and stared about him.
</p>
<p>
    "Please, sir, here I am," said the voice.
</p>
<p>
    Jed, looking down, instead of up or on a level, saw his visitor
    then.  That is, he saw a tumbled shock of curls and a pair of big
    round eyes looking up at him over a stock of weather vanes.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello!" he exclaimed, in surprise.
</p>
<p>
    The curls and eyes came out from behind the stack of vanes.  They
    were parts of a little girl, and the little girl made him a demure
    little courtesy.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you do?" she said.
</p>
<p>
    Jed regarded her in silence for a moment.  Then, "Why, I'm fair to
    middlin' smart just at present," he drawled.  "How do YOU find
    yourself to-day?"
</p>
<p>
    The young lady's answer was prompt and to the point.  "I'm nicely,
    thank you," she replied, and added: "I was sick at my stomach
    yesterday, though."
</p>
<p>
    This bit of personal information being quite unexpected, Mr.
    Winslow scarcely knew what comment to make in reply to it.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he exclaimed.  "Was you, though?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Mamma says she is 'clined to think it was the two whole
    bananas and the choc'late creams, but I think it was the fried
    potatoes.  I was sick twice&#8212;no, three times.  Please, I asked you
    something.  Are you the windmill man?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, by this time very much amused, looked her over once more.  She
    was a pretty little thing, although just at this time it is
    doubtful if any of her family or those closely associated with her
    would have admitted it.  Her face was not too clean, her frock was
    soiled and mussed, her curls had been blown into a tangle and there
    were smooches, Jed guessed them to be blackberry stains, on her
    hands, around her mouth and even across her small nose.  She had a
    doll, its raiment in about the same condition as her own, tucked
    under one arm.  Hat she had none.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow inspected her in his accustomed deliberate fashion.
</p>
<p>
    "Guess you've been havin' a pretty good time, haven't you?" he
    inquired.
</p>
<p>
    The small visitor's answer was given with dignity.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," she said.  "Will you please tell me if you are the windmill
    man?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed accepted the snub with outward humility and inward appreciation.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes," he admitted; "I presume likely I'm the windmill man.
    Is there anything I can do for you this evenin'?"
</p>
<p>
    Apparently there was, for the child, untucking the doll from
    beneath her right arm and tucking it under the left, pointed her
    right hand at a wooden weather-vane in the shape of a sperm whale
    and asked:
</p>
<p>
    "Please, does that fish go 'round?"
</p>
<p>
    "Go 'round?  Go 'round where?"
</p>
<p>
    "I mean does it go 'round and 'round on a stick?"
</p>
<p>
    "Cal'late it does when it has a chance."
</p>
<p>
    "And does it make the wind blow no'theast by no'th and&#8212;and like
    that?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Make the wind blow&#8212;how?"
</p>
<p>
    "I mean does it make the wind blow different ways, no'theast by
    no'th and cantin' 'round to the sou-east and&#8212;and those ways?
    Captain Hedge has got a fish up on his barn that used to do that,
    but now it won't 'cause he cal'lates it's rusted fast.  He said he
    guessed he would have to be getting a new one.  When I saw the
    fishes out in your yard I thought about it and I thought I would
    come in and see if you had the right kind.  Is this one a&#8212;a
    gunfish?"
</p>
<p>
    "A WHICH fish?"
</p>
<p>
    "A gunfish.  No, that isn't it.  A&#8212;a swordfish, that's it.
    Captain Hedge's is a swordfish."
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, that particular one got a wrong start and ended up by bein'
    a whale, but I shouldn't wonder if we could find a swordfish if we
    looked.  Yes, here's one.  Think that would do?"
</p>
<p>
    The child looked it over very carefully.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," she said, "I think it would.  If you're sure it would make
    the wind go right."
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, I guess likely I could guarantee that fish would go 'most
    any way the wind did, unless it should take a notion to blow
    straight up and down, which don't happen often.  So you know Cap'n
    Hedge, do you?  Relation of his, are you?  Visitin' there?"
</p>
<p>
    "No.  Mamma and I are boarding at Mrs. Smalley's, but I go over to
    call on Captain Hedge 'most every day."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Want to know!  Well, that's nice and sociable.  So you're
    boardin' at Luretta Smalley's.  My! you're consider'ble ways from
    home, ain't you?  Is your mamma with you?"
</p>
<p>
    For the first time the youthful caller's poise seemed a trifle
    shaken.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o . . . no," she stammered, and added, hastily: "How much is
    this fish, please?"
</p>
<p>
    "I generally sell that sort of fish for about two dollars."  He
    looked out of the window, hummed a tune, and then added: "Let's
    see, what did you say your name was?"
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't, but it's Barbara Armstrong.  HOW much did you say the
    fish was?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, two dollars."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Armstrong looked very much disappointed.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, dear," she sighed.  "I didn't know it would be as much as
    that.  I&#8212;I'm 'fraid I can't get it."
</p>
<p>
    "So?  That's too bad.  What was you cal'latin' to do with it, if
    you did get it?"
</p>
<p>
    "I was going to give it to Captain Hedge.  He misses his, now that
    it's rusted so fast that it won't go.  But I can't get it.  I
    haven't got but fourteen cents, ten that Mamma gave me this morning
    for being a good girl and taking my medicine nice yesterday, and
    four that Mrs. Smalley gave me for getting the eggs last week.  And
    two dollars is EVER so much more than fourteen cents, isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . .  'Tis a little more, that's right.  It's considered
    more by the&#8212;um&#8212;er&#8212;best authorities.  Hum . . . er . . . h-u-u-m.
    Sometimes, though, I do take off a little somethin' for spot cash.
    You'd pay spot cash, I presume likely, wouldn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I don't know what spot cash is.  I'd pay fourteen cents."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "We-e-ll," he drawled, gravely, "I'm afraid I
    couldn't hardly knock off all that that comes to.  But," taking
    another and much smaller vane from a shelf, "there's an article,
    not quite so big, that I usually get fifty cents for.  What do you
    think of that?"
</p>
<p>
    The child took the miniature swordfish and inspected it carefully.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a baby one, isn't it," she observed.  "Will it tell wind just
    as good as the big one?"
</p>
<p>
    "Tell wind?  Hum! . . .  Don't know's I ever heard it put just that
    way afore.  But a clock tells time, so I suppose there's no reason
    why a vane shouldn't tell wind.  Yes, I guess 'twill tell wind all
    right."
</p>
<p>
    "Then I think it might do."  She seemed a little doubtful.  "Only,"
    she added, "fifty cents is lots more than fourteen, isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow admitted that it was.  "But I tell you," he said, after
    another period of reflection, "seein' as it's you I'll make a
    proposal to you.  Cap'n Eri Hedge is a pretty good friend of mine,
    same as he is of yours.  Suppose you and I go in partners.  You put
    in your fourteen cents and I'll put in the rest of the swordfish.
    Then you can take it to Cap'n Eri and tell him that we're givin' it
    to him together.  You just consider that plan for a minute now,
    will you?"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Armstrong looked doubtful.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I don't know as I know what you mean," she said.  "What did you
    want me to do?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, consider the plan.  You know what 'consider' means, don't
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I know a Mother Goose with it in.  That one about the piper and
    the cow:
</p>
<pre>     'He took up his pipes and he played her a tune,
          Consider, old cow, consider.'
</pre>
<p>
    But I don't know as I SURELY know what he wanted the cow to do?
    Does 'consider' mean see if you like it?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's the idea.  Think it over and see if you'd like to go halves
    with me givin' the fish to Cap'n Hedge."
</p>
<p>
    The curls moved vigorously up and down.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I should," she decided.
</p>
<p>
    "Good!  Now you wait and I'll do it up."
</p>
<p>
    He wrapped the toy vane in a piece of paper and handed it to his
    small patron.  She gravely produced a miniature velvet purse with
    the remnants of some bead fringe hanging to its lower edge and laid
    a dime and four pennies on the top of a packing case between them.
    It was growing dark in the shop and Jed lighted one of the bracket
    lamps.  Returning, he found the coins laid in a row and Miss
    Armstrong regarding them somewhat soberly.
</p>
<p>
    "There isn't any MORE than fourteen, is there?" she asked.  "I
    mean&#8212;I mean fourteen cents takes all of it, doesn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her face.  His eye twinkled.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, suppose it didn't?" he asked.  "What then?"
</p>
<p>
    She hesitated.  "Why," she stammered, "if&#8212;if there was ONE left
    over I&#8212;maybe I could buy something tomorrow at the candy store.
    Not to-day, 'cause I told Mamma I wouldn't to-day 'cause I was sick
    at my stomach yesterday&#8212;but to-morrow I could."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow carefully counted the coins and then, spreading them
    out on his big palm, showed them to her.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he said.  "Now you've given me the fourteen cents.  I've
    got 'em, haven't I?"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Barbara solemnly nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," continued Jed.  "Now I'll put 'em back in your wallet again.
    There they are, shut up in the wallet.  Now you put the wallet in
    your pocket.  Now take your fish bundle under your arm.  There! now
    everything's settled.  You've got the fish, haven't you?  Sartin'.
    Yes, and I've been paid for it, haven't I?"
</p>
<p>
    The child stared at him.
</p>
<p>
    "But&#8212;but&#8212;" she began.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now don't let's argue about it," pleaded Jed, plaintively.
    "Argum always gives me the&#8212;er&#8212;epizootic or somethin'.  You saw me
    have the money right in my hand.  It's all settled; think it over
    and see if it ain't.  You've got the fish and I've HAD the fourteen
    cents.  Now run right along home and don't get lost.  Good-night."
</p>
<p>
    He led her gently to the door and closed it behind her.  Then,
    smiling and shaking his head, he returned to the inner shop, where
    he lit the lamps and sat down for another bit of painting before
    supper.  But that bit was destined not to be done that night.  He
    had scarcely picked up his brush before the doorbell rang once
    more.  Returning to the outer room, he found his recent visitor,
    the swordfish under one arm and the doll under the other, standing
    in the aisle between the stacked mills and vanes and looking, so it
    seemed to him, considerably perturbed.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, well!" he exclaimed.  "Back again so soon?  What's the
    matter; forget somethin', did you?"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Armstrong shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," she said.  "But&#8212;but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?  But what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you think&#8212;don't you think it is pretty dark for little
    girls to be out?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her, stepped to the door, opened it and looked out,
    and then turned back again.
</p>
<p>
    "Why," he admitted, "it is gettin' a little shadowy in the corners,
    maybe.  It will be darker in an hour or so.  But you think it's too
    dark for little girls already, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "I don't think Mamma would like me to be out when it's
    so awful dark," she said.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum! . . .  Hum. . . .  Does your mamma know where you are?"
</p>
<p>
    The young lady's toe marked a circle on the shop floor.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," she confessed, "I&#8212;I guess she doesn't, not just exactly."
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't be surprised.  And so you've come back because you was
    afraid, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    She swallowed hard and edged a little nearer to him.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," she declared, stoutly, "I&#8212;I wasn't afraid, not very; but&#8212;
    but I thought the&#8212;the swordfish was pretty heavy to carry all
    alone and&#8212;and so&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed laughed aloud, something that he rarely did.
</p>
<p>
    "Good for you, sis!" he exclaimed.  "Now you just wait until I get
    my hat and we'll carry that heavy fish home together."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Armstrong looked decidedly happier.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you very much," she said.  "And&#8212;and, if you please, my name
    is Barbara."

<h2>
    CHAPTER IV
</h2>
<p>
    The Smalley residence, where Mrs. Luretta Smalley, relict of the
    late Zenas T., accommodated a few "paying guests," was nearly a
    mile from the windmill shop and on the Orham "lower road."  Mr.
    Winslow and his new acquaintance took the short cuts, through by-
    paths and across fields, and the young lady appeared to have
    thoroughly recovered from her misgivings concerning the dark&#8212;in
    reality it was scarcely dusk&#8212;and her doubts concerning her ability
    to carry the "heavy" swordfish without help.  At all events she
    insisted upon carrying it alone, telling her companion that she
    thought perhaps he had better not touch it as it was so very, very
    brittle and might get broken, and consoling him by offering to
    permit him to carry Petunia, which fragrant appellation, it
    appeared, was the name of the doll.
</p>
<p>
    "I named her Petunia after a flower," she explained.  "I think she
    looks like a flower, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    If she did it was a wilted one.  However, Miss Armstrong did not
    wait for comment on the part of her escort, but chatted straight
    on.  Jed learned that her mother's name was Mrs. Ruth Phillips
    Armstrong.  "It used to be Mrs. Seymour Armstrong, but it isn't
    now, because Papa's name was Doctor Seymour Armstrong and he died,
    you know."  And they lived in a central Connecticut city, but
    perhaps they weren't going to live there any more because Mamma had
    sold the house and didn't know exactly WHAT to do.  And they had
    been in Orham ever since before the Fourth of July, and they liked
    it EVER so much, it was so quaint and&#8212;and "franteek"&#8212;
</p>
<p>
    Jed interrupted here.  "So quaint and what?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "Franteek."  Miss Barbara herself seemed a little doubtful of the
    word.  At any rate Mamma said it was something like that, and it
    meant they liked it anyway.  So Mr. Winslow was left to ponder
    whether "antique" or "unique" was intended and to follow his train
    of thought wherever it chanced to lead him, while the child
    prattled on.  They came in sight of the Smalley front gate and Jed
    came out of his walking trance to hear her say:
</p>
<p>
    "Anyway, we like it all but the sal'ratus biscuits and the coffee
    and THEY are dreadful.  Mamma thinks it's made of chickenry&#8212;the
    coffee, I mean."
</p>
<p>
    At the gate Jed's "queerness," or shyness, came upon him.  The idea
    of meeting Mrs. Armstrong or even the members of the Smalley family
    he shrank from.  Barbara invited him to come in, but he refused
    even to accompany her to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll just run along now," he said, hurriedly.  "Good night."
</p>
<p>
    The child put out her hand.  "Good night," she said.  "Thank you
    very much for helping me carry the fish home.  I'm coming to see
    you again some day."
</p>
<p>
    She scampered up the walk.  Jed, waiting in the shadow of the lilac
    bushes by the fence, saw her rattle the latch of the door, saw the
    door open and the child caught up in the arms of a woman, who
    cried: "Oh, Babbie, dear, where HAVE you been?  Mamma was SO
    frightened!"
</p>
<p>
    He smiled over the memory of the little girl's visit more than once
    that evening.  He was very fond of children and their society did
    not embarrass or annoy him as did the company of most grown-ups&#8212;
    strangers, that is.  He remembered portions of Miss Barbara's
    conversation and determined to repeat them to Captain Sam
    Hunniwell, the next time the latter called.
</p>
<p>
    And that next time was the following forenoon.  Captain Sam, on the
    way to his office at the bank, stopped his car at the edge of the
    sidewalk and came into the shop.  Jed, having finished painting
    wooden sailors for the present, was boxing an assorted collection
    of mills and vanes to be sent South, for a certain demand for
    "Winslow mills" was developing at the winter as well as the summer
    resorts.  It was far from winter yet, but this purchaser was
    forehanded.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Jed," hailed the captain, "busy as usual.  You've got the
    busy bee a mile astern so far as real hustlin' is concerned."
</p>
<p>
    Jed took a nail from the half dozen held between his lips and
    applied its point to the box top.  His sentences for the next few
    minutes were mumbled between nails and punctuated with blows of the
    hammer.
</p>
<p>
    "The busy bee," he mumbled, "can sting other folks.  He don't get
    stung much himself.  Collectin' honey's easier, I cal'late, than
    collectin' money."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam grunted.  "Are you stung again?" he demanded.  "Who did
    it this time?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed pointed with the hammer to an envelope lying on a pile of
    wooden crows.  The captain took up the envelope and inspected its
    contents.
</p>
<p>
    "'We regret to inform you,' he read aloud, 'that the Funny Novelty
    Company of this town went into bankruptcy a month ago.
</p>

<div align="center"> "'JOHN HOLWAY.'"</div>

<p>
    "Humph!" he sniffed.  "That's short and sweet.  Owed you somethin',
    I presume likely?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Seventeen dollars and three cents," he admitted,
    between the remaining nails.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Well, if you could get the seventeen dollars you'd throw off
    the three cents, wouldn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o."
</p>
<p>
    "You wouldn't?  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed pried a crookedly driven nail out again and substituted a fresh
    one.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't afford to," he drawled.  "That's the part I'll probably
    get."
</p>
<p>
    "Guess you're right.  Who's this John Holway?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh. . . .  Why, when he ordered the mills of me last summer he was
    president of the Funny Novelty Company up there to Manchester."
</p>
<p>
    "Good Lord!  Well, I admire his nerve.  How did you come to sell
    these&#8212;er&#8212;Funny folks, in the first place?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow looked surprised.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, they wrote and sent an order," he replied.
</p>
<p>
    "Did, eh?  And you didn't think of lookin' 'em up to see whether
    they was good for anything or good for nothin'?  Just sailed in and
    hurried off the stuff, I presume likely?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Why&#8212;why, yes, of course," he said.  "You see, they
    said they wanted it right away."
</p>
<p>
    His friend groaned.  "Gracious king!" he exclaimed.  "How many
    times have I told you to let me look up credits for you when you
    get an order from a stranger?  Well, there's no use talkin' to you.
    Give me this letter.  I'll see what I can squeeze out of your Funny
    friend. . . .  But, say," he added, "I can't stop but a minute, and
    I ran in to ask you if you'd changed your mind about rentin' the
    old house here.  If you have, I believe I've got a good tenant for
    you."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked troubled.  He laid down the hammer and took the last
    nail from his mouth.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Sam," he began, "you know&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I know you've set your thick head dead against rentin' it at
    all, but that's silly, as I've told you a thousand times.  The
    house is empty and it doesn't do any house good to stay empty.
    Course if 'twas anybody but you, Jed Winslow, you'd live in it
    yourself instead of campin' out in this shack here."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sat down on the box he had just nailed and, taking one long leg
    between his big hands, pulled its knee up until he could have
    rested his chin upon it without much inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
    "I know, Sam," he drawled gravely, "but that's the trouble&#8212;I ain't
    been anybody but me for forty-five years."
</p>
<p>
    The captain smiled, in spite of his impatience.  "And you won't be
    anybody else for the next forty-five," he said, "I know that.  But
    all the same, bein' a practical, more or less sane man myself, it
    makes me nervous to see a nice, attractive, comfortable little
    house standin' idle while the feller that owns it eats and sleeps
    in a two-by-four sawmill, so to speak.  And, not only that, but
    won't let anybody else live in the house, either.  I call that a
    dog in the manger business, and crazy besides."
</p>
<p>
    The big foot at the end of the long leg swung slowly back and
    forth.  Mr. Winslow looked absently at the roof.
</p>
<p>
    "DON'T look like that!" snapped Captain Sam.  "Come out of it!
    Wake up!  It always gives me the fidgets to see you settin' gapin'
    at nothin'.  What are you daydreamin' about now, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed turned and gazed over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
    "I was thinkin'," he observed, "that most likely that dog himself
    was crazy.  If he wasn't he wouldn't have got into the manger.  I
    never saw a dog that wanted to climb into a manger, did you, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, confound the manger and the dog, too!  Look here, Jed; if I
    found you a good tenant would you rent 'em that house of yours?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked more troubled than ever.
</p>
<p>
    "Sam," he began, "you know I'd do 'most anything to oblige you,
    but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oblige me!  This ain't to oblige me.  It's to oblige you."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, then I won't do it."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, then, 'tis to oblige me.  It'll oblige me to have you show
    some sense.  Come on, Jed.  These people I've got in mind are nice
    people.  They want to find a little house and they've come to me at
    the bank for advice about findin' it.  It's a chance for you, a
    real chance."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rocked back and forth.  He looked genuinely worried.
</p>
<p>
    "Who are they?" he asked, after a moment
</p>
<p>
    "Can't name any names yet."
</p>
<p>
    Another period of reflection.  Then: "City folks or Orham folks?"
    inquired Mr. Winslow.
</p>
<p>
    "City folks."
</p>
<p>
    Some of the worried look disappeared.  Jed was plainly relieved and
    more hopeful.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, then they won't want it," he declared.  "City folks want to
    hire houses in the spring, not along as late in the summer as
    this."
</p>
<p>
    "These people do.  They're thinkin' of livin' here in Orham all the
    year round.  It's a first-rate chance for you, Jed.  Course, I know
    you don't really need the money, perhaps, but&#8212;well, to be real
    honest, I want these folks to stay in Orham&#8212;they're the kind of
    folks the town needs&#8212;and I want 'em contented.  I think they would
    be contented in your house.  You let those Davidsons from Chicago
    have the place that summer, but you've never let anybody so much as
    consider it since.  What's the real reason?  You've told me as much
    as a dozen, but I'll bet anything you've never told me the real
    one.  'Twas somethin' the Davidsons did you didn't like&#8212;but what?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's rocking back and forth on the box became almost energetic and
    his troubled expression more than ever apparent.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Sam," he begged, "I've told you all about that ever and
    ever so many times.  There wasn't anything, really."
</p>
<p>
    "There was, too.  What was it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed suffered in silence for two or three minutes.
</p>
<p>
    "What was the real reason?  Out with it," persisted Captain
    Hunniwell.
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;well, 'twas&#8212;'twas&#8212;" desperately, "'twas the squeakin' and&#8212;
    and squealin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Squeakin' and squealin'?  Gracious king!  What are you talkin'
    about?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;the&#8212;the mills, you know.  The mills and vanes outside on&#8212;on
    the posts and the fence.  They squeaked and&#8212;and sometimes they
    squealed awful.  And he didn't like it."
</p>
<p>
    "Who didn't?"
</p>
<p>
    "Colonel Davidson.  He said they'd got to stop makin' that noise
    and I said I'd oil 'em every day.  And&#8212;and I forgot it."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;well, I ain't surprised to death, exactly.  What then?"
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;well, you see, they were squealin' worse than usual one
    mornin' and Colonel Davidson he came in here and&#8212;and I remembered
    I hadn't oiled 'em for three days.  And I&#8212;I said how horrible the
    squealin' was and that I'd oil 'em right away and&#8212;and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, go on! go on!"
</p>
<p>
    "And when I went out to do it there wasn't any wind and the mills
    wasn't goin' at all.  You see, 'twas his oldest daughter takin' her
    singin' lessons in the house with the window open."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam put back his head and shouted.  Jed looked sadly at the
    floor.  When the captain could speak he asked:
</p>
<p>
    "And you mean to tell me that was the reason you wouldn't let the
    house again?"
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;why, yes."
</p>
<p>
    "I know better.  You didn't have any row with the Davidsons.  You
    couldn't row with anybody, anyhow; and besides the Colonel himself
    told me they would have taken the house the very next summer but
    you wouldn't rent it to 'em.  And you mean to say that yarn you've
    just spun was the reason?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;yes."
</p>
<p>
    "Rubbish!  You've told me a dozen reasons afore, but I'm bound to
    say this is the most foolish yet.  All right, keep the real reason
    to yourself, then.  But I tell you what I'm goin' to do to get even
    with you: I'm goin' to send these folks down to look at your house
    and I shan't tell you who they are or when they're comin'."
</p>
<p>
    The knee slipped down from Mr. Winslow's grasp and his foot struck
    the floor with a crash.  He made a frantic clutch at his friend's
    arm.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, now, Sam," he cried, in horror, "don't do that!  Don't talk
    so!  You don't mean it!  Come here! . . .  Sam!"
</p>
<p>
    But the captain was at the door.  "You bet I mean it!" he declared.
    "Keep your weather eye peeled, Jed.  They'll be comin' 'most any
    time now.  And if you have ANY sense you'll let 'em the house.  So
    long!"
</p>
<p>
    He drove away in his little car.  Jed Winslow, left standing in the
    shop doorway, staring after him, groaned in anxious foreboding.
</p>
<p>
    He groaned a good many times during the next few hours.  Each time
    the bell rang announcing the arrival of a visitor he rose to answer
    it perfectly sure that here were the would-be tenants whom his
    friend, in the mistaken kindness of his heart, was sending to him.
    Not that he had the slightest idea of renting his old home, but he
    dreaded the ordeal of refusing.  In fact he was not sure that he
    could refuse, not sure that he could invent a believable excuse for
    doing so.  Another person would not have sought excuses, would have
    declared simply that the property was not for rent, but Jed Winslow
    was not that other person; he was himself, and ordinary methods of
    procedure were not his.
</p>
<p>
    Two or three groups of customers came in, purchased and departed.
    Captain Jerry Burgess dropped in to bring the Winslow mail, which
    in this case consisted of an order, a bill and a circular setting
    forth the transcendent healing qualities of African Balm, the Foe
    of Rheumatism.  Mr. Bearse happened in to discuss the great news of
    the proposed aviation camp and to tell with gusto and detail how
    Phineas Babbitt had met Captain Hunniwell "right square in front of
    the bank" and had not spoken to him.  "No, sir, never said a word
    to him no more'n if he wan't there.  What do you think of that?
    And they say Leander wrote his dad that he thought he was goin' to
    like soldierin' fust-rate, and Mrs. Sarah Mary Babbitt she told
    Melissa Busteed that her husband's language when he read that was
    somethin' sinful.  She said she never was more thankful that they
    had lightnin' rods on the roof, 'cause such talk as that was enough
    to fetch down fire from heaven."

<h2>
    CHAPTER V
</h2>
<p>
    It was nearly noon when Jed, entering the front shop in answer to
    the bell, found there the couple the sight of which caused his
    heart to sink.  Here they were, the house hunters&#8212;there was no
    doubt of it in his mind.  The man was short and broad and
    protuberant and pompous.  The woman possessed all the last three
    qualities, besides being tall.  He shone with prosperity and
    sunburn, she reeked of riches and talcum.  They were just the sort
    of people who would insist upon hiring a house that was not in the
    market; its not being in the market would, in their eyes, make it
    all the more desirable.
</p>
<p>
    Jed had seen them before, knew they were staying at the hotel and
    that their names were Powless.  He remembered now, with a thrill of
    alarm, that Mr. Bearse had recently spoken of them as liking Orham
    very much and considering getting a place of their own.  And of
    course Captain Sam, hearing this, had told them of the Winslow
    place, had sent them to him.  "Oh, Lord!  Oh, Lord!" thought Jed,
    although what he said was: "Good mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    He might as well have said nothing.  Mrs. Powless, looming large
    between the piles of mills and vanes, like a battleship in a narrow
    channel, was loftily inspecting the stock through her lorgnette.
    Her husband, his walking stick under his arm and his hands in his
    pockets, was not even making the pretense of being interested; he
    was staring through the seaward window toward the yard and the old
    house.
</p>
<p>
    "These are really quite extraordinary," the lady announced, after a
    moment.  "George, you really should see these extraordinary
    things."
</p>
<p>
    George was, evidently, not interested.  He continued to look out of
    the window.
</p>
<p>
    "What are they?" he asked, without turning.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't know.  All sorts of queer dolls and boats&#8212;and
    creatures, made of wood.  Like those outside, you know&#8212;er&#8212;
    teetotums, windmills.  Do come and look at them."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Powless did not comply.  He said "Umph" and that was all.
</p>
<p>
    "George," repeated Mrs. Powless, "do you hear me?  Come and look at
    them."
</p>
<p>
    And George came.  One might have inferred that, when his wife spoke
    like that, he usually came.  He treated a wooden porpoise to a
    thoroughly wooden stare and repeated his remark of "Umph!"
</p>
<p>
    "Aren't they extraordinary!" exclaimed his wife.  "Does this man
    make them himself, I wonder?"
</p>
<p>
    She seemed to be addressing her husband, so Jed did not answer.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you?" demanded Mr. Powless.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," replied Jed.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Powless said "Fancy!"  Mr. Powless strolled back to the
    window.
</p>
<p>
    "This view is all right, Mollie," he observed.  "Better even than
    it is from the street.  Come and see."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Powless went and saw.  Jed stood still and stared miserably.
</p>
<p>
    "Rather attractive, on the whole, don't you think, dear?" inquired
    the gentleman.  "Must be very decent in the yard there."
</p>
<p>
    The lady did not reply, but she opened the door and went out,
    around the corner of the shop and into the back yard.  Her husband
    trotted after her.  The owner of the property, gazing pathetically
    through the window, saw them wandering about the premises, looking
    off at the view, up into the trees, and finally trying the door of
    the old house and peeping in between the slats of the closed
    blinds.  Then they came strolling back to the shop.  Jed, drawing a
    long breath, prepared to face the ordeal.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Powless entered the shop.  Mr. Powless remained by the door.
    He spoke first.
</p>
<p>
    "You own all this?" he asked, indicating the surrounding country
    with a wave of his cane.  Jed nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "That house, too?" waving the point of the cane toward the Winslow
    cottage.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "How old is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed stammered that he guessed likely it was about a hundred years
    old or such matter.
</p>
<p>
    "Umph!  Furniture old, too?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I cal'late most of it is."
</p>
<p>
    "Nobody living in it?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o."
</p>
<p>
    "Got the key to it?"
</p>
<p>
    Here was the question direct.  If he answered in the affirmative
    the next utterance of the Powless man would be a command to be
    shown the interior of the house.  Jed was certain of it, he could
    see it in the man's eye.  What was infinitely more important, he
    could see it in the lady's eye.  He hesitated.
</p>
<p>
    "Got the key to it?" repeated Mr. Powless.
</p>
<p>
    Jed swallowed.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he faltered, "I&#8212;I guess not."
</p>
<p>
    "You GUESS not.  Don't you know whether you've got it or not?"
</p>
<p>
    "No.  I mean yes.  I know I ain't."
</p>
<p>
    "Where is it; lost?"
</p>
<p>
    The key was usually lost, that is to say, Jed was accustomed to
    hunt for fifteen minutes before finding it, so, his conscience
    backing his inclination, he replied that he cal'lated it must be.
</p>
<p>
    "Umph!" grunted Powless.  "How do you get into the house without a
    key?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin, swallowed hard, and drawled that he didn't
    very often.
</p>
<p>
    "You do sometimes, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    The best answer that the harassed windmill maker could summon was
    that he didn't know.  The red-faced gentleman stared at him in
    indignant amazement.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't KNOW?" he repeated.  "Which don't you know, whether you
    go into the house at all, or how you get in without a key?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes,&#8212;er&#8212;er&#8212;that's it."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Powless breathed deeply.  "Well, I'll be damned!" he declared,
    with conviction.
</p>
<p>
    His wife did not contradict his assertion, but she made one of her
    own.
</p>
<p>
    "George," she commanded majestically, "can't you see the man has
    been drinking.  Probably he doesn't own the place at all.  Don't
    waste another moment on him.  We will come back later, when the
    real owner is in.  Come!"
</p>
<p>
    George came and they both went.  Mr. Winslow wiped his perspiring
    forehead on a piece of wrapping paper and sat down upon a box to
    recover.  Recovery, however, was by no means rapid or complete.
    They had gone, but they were coming back again; and what should he
    say to them then?  Very likely Captain Sam, who had sent them in
    the first place, would return with them.  And Captain Sam knew that
    the key was not really lost.  Jed's satisfaction in the fact that
    he had escaped tenantless so far was nullified by the fear that his
    freedom was but temporary.
</p>
<p>
    He cooked his dinner, but ate little.  After washing the dishes he
    crossed the road to the telephone and telegraph office and called
    up the Orham Bank.  He meant to get Captain Hunniwell on the wire,
    tell him that the house hunters had paid him a visit, that he did
    not like them, and beg the captain to call them off the scent.  But
    Captain Sam had motored to Ostable to attend a preliminary session
    of the Exemption Board.  Jed sauntered gloomily back to the shop.
    When he opened the door and entered he was greeted by a familiar
    voice, which said:
</p>
<p>
    "Here he is, Mamma.  Good afternoon, Mr. Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed started, turned, and found Miss Barbara Armstrong beaming up at
    him.  The young lady's attire and general appearance were in marked
    contrast to those of the previous evening.  Petunia also was in
    calling costume; save for the trifling lack of one eye and a chip
    from the end of her nose, she would have been an ornament to doll
    society anywhere.
</p>
<p>
    "This is my mamma," announced Barbara.  "She's come to see you."
</p>
<p>
    "How do you do, Mr. Winslow?" said Mrs. Armstrong.
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up to find her standing beside him, her hand extended.
    Beside a general impression that she was young and that her gown
    and hat and shoes were white, he was at that moment too greatly
    embarrassed to notice much concerning her appearance.  Probably he
    did not notice even this until later.  However, he took her hand,
    moved it up and down, dropped it again and said: "I&#8212;I'm pleased to
    meet you, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    She smiled.  "And I am very glad to meet you," she said.  "It was
    very kind of you to bring my little girl home last night and she
    and I have come to thank you for doing it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was more embarrassed than ever.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho!" he protested; "'twasn't anything."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes, it was; it was a great deal.  I was getting very worried,
    almost frightened.  She had been gone ever since luncheon&#8212;dinner,
    I mean&#8212;and I had no idea where.  She's a pretty good little girl,
    generally speaking," drawing the child close and smiling down upon
    her, "but sometimes she is heedless and forgets.  Yesterday she
    forgot, didn't you, dear?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't forget," she said.  "I mean I only forgot a little.
    Petunia forgot almost EVERYTHING.  I forgot and went as far as the
    bridge, but she forgot all the way to the clam field."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "The which field?" he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    "The clam field.  The place where Mrs. Smalley's fish man unplants
    the clams she makes the chowder of.  He does it with a sort of hoe
    thing and puts them in a pail.  He was doing it yesterday; I saw
    him."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's eyes twinkled at the word "unplants," but another thought
    occurred to him.
</p>
<p>
    "You wasn't out on those clam flats alone, was you?" he asked,
    addressing Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "Petunia and I went all alone," she said.  "It was
    kind of wet so we took off our shoes and stockings and paddled.
    I&#8212;I don't know's I remembered to tell you that part, Mamma," she
    added, hastily.  "I&#8212;I guess it must have slipped my mind."
</p>
<p>
    But Mrs. Armstrong was watching Jed's face.
</p>
<p>
    "Was there any danger?" she asked, quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Jed hesitated before answering.  "Why," he drawled, "I&#8212;I don't
    know as there was, but&#8212;well, the tide comes in kind of slow off ON
    the flats, but it's liable to fill up the channels between them and
    the beach some faster.  Course if you know the wadin' places it's
    all right, but if you don't it's&#8212;well, it's sort of uncomfortable,
    that's all."
</p>
<p>
    The lady's cheeks paled a bit, but she did not exclaim, nor as Jed
    would have said "make a fuss."  She said, simply, "Thank you, I
    will remember," and that was the only reference she made to the
    subject of the "clam field."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Barbara, to whom the events of dead yesterdays were of no
    particular concern compared to those of the vital and living to-
    day, was rummaging among the stock.
</p>
<p>
    "Mamma," she cried, excitedly, "here is a whale fish like the one I
    was going to buy for Captain Hedge.  Come and see it."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong came and was much interested.  She asked Jed
    questions concerning the "whale fish" and others of his creations.
    At first his replies were brief and monosyllabic, but gradually
    they became more lengthy, until, without being aware of it, he was
    carrying on his share of a real conversation.  Of course, he
    hesitated and paused and drawled, but he always did that, even when
    talking with Captain Sam Hunniwell.
</p>
<p>
    He took down and exhibited his wares one by one.  Barbara asked
    numberless questions concerning each and chattered like a red
    squirrel.  Her mother showed such a genuine interest in his work
    and was so pleasant and quiet and friendly, was, in short, such a
    marked contrast to Mrs. George Powless, that he found himself
    actually beginning to enjoy the visit.  Usually he was glad when
    summer folks finished their looking and buying and went away; but
    now, when Mrs. Armstrong glanced at the clock on the shelf, he was
    secretly glad that that clock had not gone for over four months and
    had providentially stopped going at a quarter after three.
</p>
<p>
    He took them into the inner shop, his workroom, and showed them the
    band saw and the lathe and the rest of his manufacturing outfit.
    Barbara asked if he lived there all alone and he said he did.
</p>
<p>
    "I live out there," he explained, pointing toward the shop
    extension.  "Got a sittin'-room and a kitchen out there, and a
    little upstairs, where I sleep."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong seemed surprised.  "Why!" she exclaimed, "I thought
    you lived in that dear little old house next door here.  I was told
    that you owned it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Yes, ma'am," he said, "I do own it, but I don't live
    in it.  I used to live there, but I ain't for quite a spell now."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't see how you could bear to give it up.  It looks so quaint
    and homey, and if the inside is as delightful as the outside it
    must be quite wonderful.  And the view is the best in town, isn't
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was pleased.  "Why, yes, ma'am, 'tis pretty good," he admitted.
    "Anyhow, most folks seem to cal'late 'tis.  Wouldn't you like to
    come out and look at it?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara clapped her hands.  "Oh, yes, Mamma, do!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
    Her mother hesitated.  "I don't know that we ought to trouble Mr.
    Winslow," she said.  "He is busy, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed protested.  "It won't be a mite of trouble," he declared.
    "Besides, it ain't healthy to work too long at a stretch.  That
    is," he drawled, "folks say 'tain't, so I never take the risk."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong smiled and followed him out into the yard, where
    Miss Barbara had already preceded them.  The view over the edge of
    the bluff was glorious and the grass in the yard was green, the
    flowers bright and pretty and the shadows of the tall lilac bushes
    by the back door of the little white house cool and inviting.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara danced along the bluff edge, looking down at the dories and
    nets on the beach below.  Her mother sighed softly.
</p>
<p>
    "It is lovely!" she said.  Then, turning to look at the little
    house, she added, "And it was your old home, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Yes, ma'am," he replied.  "I was born in that house
    and lived there all my life up to five years ago."
</p>
<p>
    "And then you gave it up.  Why? . . .  Please forgive me.  I didn't
    mean to be curious."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, that's all right, ma'am.  Nothin' secret about it.  My mother
    died and I didn't seem to care about livin' there alone, that's
    all."
</p>
<p>
    "I see.  I understand."
</p>
<p>
    She looked as if she did understand, and Jed, the seldom
    understood, experienced an unusual pleasure.  The sensation
    produced an unusual result.
</p>
<p>
    "It's a kind of cute and old-fashioned house inside," he observed.
    "Maybe you'd like to go in and look around; would you?"
</p>
<p>
    She looked very much pleased.  "Oh, I should, indeed!" she
    exclaimed.  "May I?"
</p>
<p>
    Now, the moment after he issued the invitation he was sorry.  It
    had been quite unpremeditated and had been given he could not have
    told why.  His visitor had seemed so genuinely interested, and,
    above all, had treated him like a rational human being instead of a
    freak.  Under this unaccustomed treatment Jed Winslow had been
    caught off his guard&#8212;hypnotized, so to speak.  And now, when it
    was too late, he realized the possible danger.  Only a few hours
    ago he had told Mr. and Mrs. George Powless that the key to that
    house had been lost.
</p>
<p>
    He paused and hesitated.  Mrs. Armstrong noticed his hesitation.
</p>
<p>
    "Please don't think any more about it," she said.  "It is
    delightful here in the yard.  Babbie and I will stay here a few
    minutes, if we may, and you must go back to your work, Mr.
    Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    But Jed, having put his foot in it, was ashamed to withdraw.  He
    hastened to disclaim any intention of withdrawal.
</p>
<p>
    "No, no," he protested.  "I don't need to go to work, not yet
    anyhow.  I should be real pleased to show you the house, ma'am.
    You wait now and I'll fetch the key."
</p>
<p>
    Some five minutes later he reappeared with triumph in his eye and
    the "lost" key in his hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Sorry to keep you waitin', ma'am," he explained.  "The key had&#8212;
    er&#8212;stole its nest, as you might say.  Got it now, though."
</p>
<p>
    His visitors looked at the key, which was attached by a cord to a
    slab of wood about the size of half a shingle.  Upon one side of
    the slab were lettered in black paint the words HERE IT IS.
    Barbara's curiosity was aroused.
</p>
<p>
    "What have you got those letters on there for, Mr. Winslow?" she
    asked.  "What does it say?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed solemnly read the inscription.  "I printed that on there," he
    explained, "so I'd be able to find the key when I wanted it."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong smiled.  "I should think it might help," she
    observed, evidently much amused.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow nodded.  "You would think so," he said, "wouldn't you?
    Maybe 'twould, too, only 'twas such a plaguey nuisance, towin' that
    half a cord of wood around, that I left it to home last time.
    Untied the string, you know, and just took the key.  The wood and
    the string was hangin' up in the right place, but the key wan't
    among those present, as they say in the newspapers."
</p>
<p>
    "Where was it?" demanded Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, dear," cautioned her mother.  "You mustn't ask so many
    questions."
</p>
<p>
    "That's all right, ma'am; I don't mind a mite.  Where was it?
    We-ll, 'twas in my pants pocket here, just where I put it last
    time I used it.  Naturally enough I shouldn't have thought of
    lookin' there and I don't know's I'd have found it yet, but I
    happened to shove my hands in my pockets to help me think, and
    there 'twas."
</p>
<p>
    This explanation should have been satisfying, doubtless, but
    Barbara did not seem to find it wholly so.
</p>
<p>
    "Please may I ask one more question, Mamma?" she pleaded.  "Just
    only one?"
</p>
<p>
    She asked it before her mother could reply.
</p>
<p>
    "How does putting your hands in your pockets help you think, Mr.
    Winslow?" she asked.  "I don't see how it would help a bit?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's eye twinkled, but his reply was solemnly given.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, you see," he drawled, "I'm built a good deal like the old
    steam launch Tobias Wixon used to own.  Every time Tobias blew the
    whistle it used up all the steam and the engine stopped.  I've got
    a head about like that engine; when I want to use it I have to give
    all the rest of me a layoff. . . .  Here we are, ma'am.  Walk right
    in, won't you."
</p>
<p>
    He showed them through room after room of the little house, opening
    the closed shutters so that the afternoon sunlight might stream in
    and brighten their progress.  The rooms were small, but they were
    attractive and cosy.  The furniture was almost all old mahogany and
    in remarkably good condition.  The rugs were home-made; even the
    coverlets of the beds were of the old-fashioned blue and white,
    woven on the hand looms of our great-grandmothers.  Mrs. Armstrong
    was enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>
    "It is like a miniature museum of antiques," she declared.  "And
    such wonderful antiques, too.  You must have been besieged by
    people who wanted to buy them."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Ye-es," he admitted, "I cal'late there's been no
    less'n a million antiquers here in the last four or five year.  I
    don't mean here in the house&#8212;I never let 'em in the house&#8212;but
    'round the premises.  Got so they kind of swarmed first of every
    summer, like June bugs.  I got rid of 'em, though, for a spell."
</p>
<p>
    "Did you; how?"
</p>
<p>
    He rubbed his chin.  "Put up a sign by the front door that said:
    'Beware of Leprosy.'  That kept 'em away while it lasted."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong laughed merrily.  "I should think so," she said.
    "But why leprosy, pray?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I was goin' to make it smallpox, but I asked Doctor Parker if
    there was anything worse than smallpox and he said he cal'lated
    leprosy was about as bad as any disease goin'.  It worked fine
    while it lasted, but the Board of Health made me take it down; said
    there wan't any leprosy on the premises.  I told 'em no, but 'twas
    a good idea to beware of it anyhow, and I'd put up the sign just on
    general principles.  No use; they hadn't much use for principles,
    general or otherwise, seemed so."
</p>
<p>
    The lady commented on the neatness and order in the little rooms.
    They were in marked contrast to the workshop.  "I suppose you have
    a woman come here to clean and sweep," she said.
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he answered.  "I generally cal'late to come in every little
    while and clean up.  Mother was always a great one for keepin'
    things slicked up," he added, apologetically, "and I&#8212;I kind of
    like to think 'twould please her.  Foolish, I presume likely, but&#8212;
    well, foolish things seem to come natural to me.  Got a kind of a
    gift for 'em, as you might say.  I . . ."
</p>
<p>
    He lapsed into silence, his sentence only begun.  Mrs. Armstrong,
    looking up, found him gazing at her with the absent, far-off look
    that his closest associates knew so well.  She had not met it
    before and found it rather embarrassing, especially as it kept on
    and on.
</p>
<p>
    "Well?" she asked, after a time.  He started and awoke to
    realities.
</p>
<p>
    "I was just thinkin'," he explained, "that you was the only woman
    that has been in this house since the summer I let it to the
    Davidson folks.  And Mrs. Davidson wan't a mite like you."
</p>
<p>
    That was true enough.  Mrs. Davidson had been a plump elderly
    matron with gray hair, a rather rasping voice and a somewhat
    aggressive manner.  Mrs. Armstrong was young and slim, her hair and
    eyes were dark, her manner refined and her voice low and gentle.
    And, if Jed had been in the habit of noticing such things, he might
    have noticed that she was pleasant to look at.  Perhaps he was
    conscious of this fact, but, if so, it was only in a vague, general
    way.
</p>
<p>
    His gaze wandered to Barbara, who, with Petunia, was curled up in a
    big old-fashioned rocker.
</p>
<p>
    "And a child, too," he mused.  "I don't know when there's been a
    child in here.  Not since I was one, I guess likely, and that's too
    long ago for anybody to remember single-handed."
</p>
<p>
    But Mrs. Armstrong was interested in his previous remark.
</p>
<p>
    "You have let others occupy this house then?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ma'am, one summer I did.  Let it furnished to some folks name
    of Davidson, from Chicago."
</p>
<p>
    "And you haven't rented it since?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, ma'am, not but that once."
</p>
<p>
    She was silent for a moment.  Then she said: "I am surprised that
    it hasn't been occupied always.  Do you ask such a VERY high rent,
    Mr. Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked doubtful.  "Why, no, ma'am," he answered.  "I didn't
    cal'late 'twas so very high, considerin' that 'twas just for
    'summer and furnished and all.  The Davidsons paid forty dollars a
    month, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "FORTY dollars!  A month?  And furnished like that?  You mean a
    week, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow looked at her.  The slow smile wandered across his
    face.  He evidently suspected a joke.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, no, ma'am," he drawled.  "You see, they was rentin' the
    place, not buyin' it."
</p>
<p>
    "But forty dollars a month is VERY cheap."
</p>
<p>
    "Is it?  Sho!  Now you speak of it I remember that Captain Sam
    seemed to cal'late 'twas.  He said I ought to have asked a hundred,
    or some such foolishness.  I told him he must have the notion that
    I was left out of the sweet ile when they pickled the other thirty-
    nine thieves.  Perhaps you've read the story, ma'am," he suggested.
</p>
<p>
    His visitor laughed.  "I have read it," she said.  Then she added,
    plainly more to herself than to him: "But even forty is far too
    much, of course."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was surprised and a little hurt.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;er&#8212;yes, ma'am," he faltered.  "Well, I&#8212;I was kind of 'fraid
    'twas, but Colonel Davidson seemed to think 'twas about fair, so&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you misunderstand me.  I didn't mean that forty dollars was
    too high a rent.  It isn't, it is a very low one.  I meant that it
    was more than I ought to think of paying.  You see, Mr. Winslow, I
    have been thinking that we might live here in Orham, Barbara and I.
    I like the town; and the people, most of those I have met, have
    been very pleasant and kind.  And it is necessary&#8212;that is, it
    seems to me preferable&#8212;that we live, for some years at least, away
    from the city.  This little house of yours is perfect.  I fell in
    love with the outside of it at first sight.  Now I find the inside
    even more delightful.  I"&#8212;she hesitated, and then added&#8212;"I don't
    suppose you would care to let it unfurnished at&#8212;at a lower rate?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was very much embarrassed.  The idea that his caller would make
    such a proposition as this had not occurred to him for a moment.
    If it had the lost key would almost certainly have remained lost.
    He liked Mrs. Armstrong even on such short acquaintance, and he had
    taken a real fancy to Barbara; but his prejudice against tenants
    remained.  He rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, now, ma'am," he stammered, "you&#8212;you wouldn't like
    livin' in Orham all the year 'round, would you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I hope I should.  I know I should like it better than living&#8212;
    elsewhere," with, so it seemed to him, a little shudder.  "And I
    cannot afford to live otherwise than very simply anywhere.  I have
    been boarding in Orham for almost three months now and I feel that
    I have given it a trial."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, ma'am, but summer's considerable more lively than winter
    here on the Cape."
</p>
<p>
    "I have no desire for society.  I expect to be quiet and I wish to
    be.  Mr. Winslow, would you consider letting me occupy this house&#8212;
    unfurnished, of course?  I should dearly love to take it just as it
    is&#8212;this furniture is far more fitting for it than mine&#8212;but I
    cannot afford forty dollars a month.  Provided you were willing to
    let me hire the house of you at all, not for the summer alone but
    for all the year, what rent do you think you should charge?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's embarrassment increased.  "Well, now, ma'am," he faltered,
    "I&#8212;I hope you won't mind my sayin' it, but&#8212;but I don't know's I
    want to let this house at all.  I&#8212;I've had consider'ble many
    chances to rent it, but&#8212;but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He could not seem to find a satisfactory ending to the sentence and
    so left it unfinished.  Mrs. Armstrong was evidently much
    disappointed, but she did not give up completely.
</p>
<p>
    "I see," she said.  "Well, in a way I think I understand.  You
    prefer the privacy.  I think I could promise you that Barbara and I
    would disturb you very little.  As to the rent, that would be paid
    promptly."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin, ma'am, sartin; I know 'twould, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Won't you think it over?  We might even live here for a month,
    with your furniture undisturbed and at the regular rental.  You
    could call it a trial month, if you liked.  You could see how you
    liked us, you know.  At the end of that time," with a smile, "you
    might tell us we wouldn't do at all, or, perhaps, then you might
    consider making a more permanent arrangement.  Barbara would like
    it here, wouldn't you, dear?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara, who had been listening, nodded excitedly from the big
    rocker.  "Ever and ever so much," she declared; "and Petunia would
    just adore it."
</p>
<p>
    Poor Jed was greatly perturbed.  "Don't talk so, Mrs. Armstrong,"
    he blurted.  "Please don't.  I&#8212;I don't want you to.  You&#8212;you make
    me feel bad."
</p>
<p>
    "Do I?  I'm so sorry.  I didn't mean to say anything to hurt your
    feelings.  I beg your pardon."
</p>
<p>
    "No, you don't.  I&#8212;I mean you hadn't ought to.  You don't hurt my
    feelin's; I mean you make me feel bad&#8212;wicked&#8212;cussed mean&#8212;all
    that and some more.  I know I ought to let you have this house.
    Any common, decent man with common decent feelin's and sense would
    let you have it.  But, you see, I ain't that kind.  I&#8212;I'm selfish
    and&#8212;and wicked and&#8212;"  He waved a big hand in desperation.
</p>
<p>
    She laughed.  "Nonsense!" she exclaimed.  "Besides, it isn't so
    desperate as all that.  You certainly are not obliged to rent the
    house unless you want to."
</p>
<p>
    "But I do want to; that is, I don't, but I know I'd ought to want
    to.  And if I was goin' to let anybody have it I'd rather 'twould
    be you&#8212;honest, I would.  And it's the right thing for me to do, I
    know that.  That's what bothers me; the trouble's with ME.  I don't
    want to do the right thing."  He broke off, seemed to reflect and
    then asked suddenly:
</p>
<p>
    "Ma'am, do you want to go to heaven when you die?"
</p>
<p>
    The lady was naturally somewhat surprised at the question.  "Why,
    yes," she replied, "I&#8212;  Why, of course I do."
</p>
<p>
    "There, that's it!  Any decent, sensible person would.  But I don't."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara, startled into forgetting that children should be seen and
    not heard, uttered a shocked "Oh!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed waved his hand.  "You see," he said, "even that child's morals
    are upset by me.  I know I ought to want to go to heaven.  But when
    I see the crowd that KNOW they're goin' there, are sartin of it,
    the ones from this town, a good many of 'em anyhow; when I hear how
    they talk in prayer-meetin' and then see how they act outside of
    it, I&#8212;  Well," with a deep sigh, "I want to go where they ain't,
    that's all."  He paused, and then drawled solemnly, but with a
    suspicion of the twinkle in his eye: "The general opinion seems to
    be that that's where I'll go, so's I don't know's I need to worry."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong made no comment on this confession.  He did not seem
    to expect any.
</p>
<p>
    "Ma'am," he continued, "you see what I mean.  The trouble's with
    me, I ain't made right.  I ought to let that house; Sam Hunniwell
    told me so this mornin'.  But I&#8212;I don't want to.  Nothin' personal
    to you, you understand; but . . . Eh?  Who's that?"
</p>
<p>
    A step sounded on the walk outside and voices were heard.  Jed
    turned to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Customers, I cal'late," he said.  "Make yourselves right to home,
    ma'am, you and the little girl.  I'll be right back."
</p>
<p>
    He went out through the dining-room into the little hall.  Barbara,
    in the big rocker, looked up over Petunia's head at her mother.
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't he a funny man, Mamma?" she said.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong nodded.  "Yes, he certainly is," she admitted.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," the child nodded reflectively.  "But I don't believe he's
    wicked at all.  I believe he's real nice, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure he is, dear."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Petunia and I like him.  I think he's what you said our
    Bridget was, a rough damson."
</p>
<p>
    "Not damson; diamond, dear."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes.  It was damson preserve Mrs. Smalley had for supper last
    night.  I forgot.  Petunia told me to say damson; she makes so many
    mistakes."
</p>
<p>
    They heard the "rough diamond" returning.  He seemed to be in a
    hurry.  When he re-entered the little sitting-room he looked very
    much frightened.
</p>
<p>
    "What is the matter?" demanded Mrs. Armstrong.
</p>
<p>
    Jed gulped.
</p>
<p>
    "They've come back," he whispered.  "Godfreys, I forgot 'em, and
    they've come back.  WHAT'LL I do now?"
</p>
<p>
    "But who&#8212;who has come back?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow waved both hands.
</p>
<p>
    "The Old Scratch and his wife," he declared.  "I hope they didn't
    see me, but&#8212;Land of love, they're comin' in!"
</p>
<p>
    A majestic tread sounded in the hall, in the dining-room. Mrs.
    George Powless appeared, severe, overwhelming, with Mr. George
    Powless in her wake.  The former saw Mr. Winslow and fixed him with
    her glittering eye, as the Ancient Mariner fixed the wedding guest.
</p>
<p>
    "Ah!" she observed, with majestic irony, "the lost key is found, it
    would seem."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked guilty.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ma'am," he faltered.  "Er&#8212;yes, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    "So?  And now, I presume, as it is apparent that you do show the
    interior of this house to other interested persons," with a glance
    like a sharpened icicle in the direction of the Armstrongs,
    "perhaps you will show it to my husband and me."
</p>
<p>
    Jed swallowed hard.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, ma'am," he faltered, "I&#8212;I'd like to, but&#8212;but the fact is,
    I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, what?"
</p>
<p>
    "It ain't my house."
</p>
<p>
    "Isn't your house?  George," turning to Mr. Powless, "didn't I hear
    this man distinctly tell you that this house WAS his?"
</p>
<p>
    George nodded.  "Certainly, my dear," he declared.  Then turning to
    Mr. Winslow, he demanded: "What do you mean by saying it is yours
    one moment and not yours the next; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked around.  For one instant his gaze rested upon the face
    of Mrs. Armstrong.  Then he drew himself up.
</p>
<p>
    "Because," he declared, "I've rented it furnished to this lady
    here.  And, that bein' the case, it ain't mine just now and I ain't
    got any right to be in it.  And," his voice rising in desperation,
    "neither has anybody else."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. George Powless went a few moments later; before she went she
    expressed her opinion of Mr. Winslow's behavior.  Mr. George
    Powless followed her, expressing his opinion as he went.  The
    object of their adjuration sat down upon a rush-bottomed chair and
    rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Lord!" he exclaimed, with fervor.  Mrs. Armstrong looked at him in
    amazement.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow!" she exclaimed, and burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
    Jed groaned.  "I know how Jonah felt after the whale unloaded him,"
    he drawled.  "That woman all but had me swallered.  If you hadn't
    been here she would."
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!" shouted a voice outside.  "Jed, where are you?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow raised his head.  "Eh?" he queried.  "That's Sam
    hollerin', ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    It was Captain Hunniwell and a moment later he entered the little
    sitting-room.  When he saw who his friend's companions were he
    seemed greatly surprised.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mrs. Armstrong!" he exclaimed.  "Are you here?  Now that's a
    funny thing.  The last time I saw Jed I warned him I was goin' to
    send you here to look at this house.  And you came without bein'
    sent, after all; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed stared at him.  Before the lady could reply he spoke.  "What?"
    he cried.  "Was she&#8212;Sam Hunniwell, was it HER you was goin' to
    send to see about hirin' this house?"
</p>
<p>
    "Sure it was.  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed pointed toward the door.  "Then&#8212;then who," he demanded, "sent
    those Powlesses here?"
</p>
<p>
    "No one that I know of.  And anyhow they don't want to rent any
    houses.  They've bought land over at Harnissport and they're goin'
    to build a house of their own there."
</p>
<p>
    "They are?  They are?  Then&#8212;then WHAT did that woman say I'd got
    to show her the inside of this house for?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know.  Did she?  Oh, I tell you what she was after,
    probably.  Some one had told her about your old furniture and
    things, Jed.  She's the greatest antique hunter on earth, so they
    tell me.  That's what she was after&#8212;antiques."
</p>
<p>
    Jed, having paused until this had sunk in, groaned.
</p>
<p>
    "Lord!" he said, again.  "And I went and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Another groan finished the sentence.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong came forward.
</p>
<p>
    "Please don't worry about it, Mr. Winslow," she said.  "I know you
    didn't mean it.  Of course, knowing your feelings, I shouldn't
    think of taking the house."
</p>
<p>
    But Jed slowly shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "I want you to," he declared.  "Yes, I mean it.  I want you to come
    and live in this house for a month, anyhow.  If you don't, that
    Powless woman will come back and buy every stick and rag on the
    place.  I don't want to sell 'em, but I couldn't say no to her any
    more than I could to the Old Harry.  I called her the Old Scratch's
    wife, didn't I," he added.  "Well, I won't take it back."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam laughed uproariously.
</p>
<p>
    "You ain't very complimentary to Mr. Powless," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "I would be if I was referrin' to him," he drawled, "but I judge
    he's her second husband."

<h2>
    CHAPTER VI
</h2>
<p>
    Of course Mrs. Armstrong still insisted that, knowing, as she did,
    Mr. Winslow's prejudice against occupying the position of landlord,
    she could not think of accepting his offer.  "Of course I shall
    not," she declared.  "I am flattered to know that you consider
    Barbara and me preferable to Mr. and Mrs. Powless; but even there
    you may be mistaken, and, beside, why should you feel you must
    endure the lesser evil.  If I were in your place I shouldn't endure
    any evil at all.  I should keep the house closed and empty, just as
    you have been doing."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam shook his head impatiently.  "If you was in his place,"
    he observed, "you would have let it every year.  Don't interfere
    with him, Mrs. Armstrong, for the land sakes.  He's showed the
    first streak of common sense about that house that he's showed
    since the Davidsons went out.  Don't ask him to take it back."
</p>
<p>
    And Jed stubbornly refused to take it back.  "I've let it to you
    for a month, ma'am," he insisted.  "It's yours, furniture and all,
    for a month.  You won't sell that Mrs. Powless any of it, will
    you?" he added, anxiously.  "Any of the furniture, I mean."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong scarcely knew whether to be amused or indignant.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course I shouldn't sell it," she declared.  "It wouldn't be
    mine to sell."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked frightened.  "Yes, 'twould; yes, 'twould," he persisted.
    "That's why I'm lettin' it to you.  Then I can't sell it to her; I
    CAN'T, don't you see?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam grinned.  "Fur's that goes," he suggested, "I don't
    see's you've got to worry, Jed.  You don't need to sell it, to her
    or anybody else, unless you want to."
</p>
<p>
    But Jed looked dubious.  "I suppose Jonah cal'lated he didn't need
    to be swallowed," he mused.  "You take it, ma'am, for a month, as a
    favor to me."
</p>
<p>
    "But how can I&#8212;like this?  We haven't even settled the question of
    rent.  And you know nothing whatever about me."
</p>
<p>
    He seemed to reflect.  Then he asked:
</p>
<p>
    "Your daughter don't sing like a windmill, does she?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara's eyes and mouth opened.  "Why, Mamma!" she exclaimed,
    indignantly.
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, Babbie.  Sing like a&#8212;what?  I don't understand, Mr.
    Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    The captain burst out laughing.  "No wonder you don't, ma'am," he
    said.  "It takes the seven wise men of Greece to understand him
    most of the time.  You leave it to me, Mrs. Armstrong.  He and I
    will talk it over together and then you and he can talk to-morrow.
    But I guess likely you'll have the house, if you want it; Jed
    doesn't go back on his word.  I always say that for you, don't I,
    old sawdust?" turning to the gentleman thus nicknamed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed, humming a mournful hymn, was apparently miles away in
    dreamland.  Yet he returned to earth long enough to indulge in a
    mild bit of repartee.  "You say 'most everything for me, Sam," he
    drawled, "except when I talk in my sleep."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong and Barbara left a moment later, the lady saying
    that she and Mr. Winslow would have another interview next day.
    Barbara gravely shook hands with both men.
</p>
<p>
    "I and Petunia hope awfully that we are going to live here, Mr.
    Winslow," she said, "'specially Petunia."
</p>
<p>
    Jed regarded her gravely.  "Oh, she wants to more'n you do, then,
    does she?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    The child looked doubtful.  "No-o," she admitted, after a moment's
    reflection, "but she can't talk, you know, and so she has to hope
    twice as hard else I wouldn't know it.  Good-by.  Oh, I forgot;
    Captain Hedge liked his swordfish EVER so much.  He said it was a&#8212;
    a&#8212;oh, yes, humdinger."
</p>
<p>
    She trotted off after her mother.  Captain Hunniwell, after a
    chuckle of appreciation over the "humdinger," began to tell his
    friend what little he had learned concerning the Armstrongs.  This
    was, of course, merely what Mrs. Armstrong herself had told him and
    amounted to this: She was a widow whose husband had been a
    physician in Middleford, Connecticut.  His name was Seymour
    Armstrong and he had now been dead four years.  Mrs. Armstrong and
    Barbara, the latter an only child, had continued to occupy the
    house at Middleford, but recently the lady had come to feel that
    she could not afford to live there longer, but must find some less
    expensive quarters.
</p>
<p>
    "She didn't say so," volunteered Captain Sam, "but I judge she lost
    a good deal of her money, bad investments or somethin' like that.
    If there's any bad investment anywheres in the neighborhood you can
    'most generally trust a widow to hunt it up and put her insurance
    money into it.  Anyhow, 'twas somethin' like that, for after livin'
    there a spell, just as she did when her husband was alive, she all
    at once decides to up anchor and find some cheaper moorin's.  First
    off, though, she decided to spend the summer in a cool place and
    some friend, somebody with good, sound judgment, suggests Orham.
    So she lets her own place in Middleford, comes to Orham, falls in
    love with the place&#8212;same as any sensible person would naturally,
    of course&#8212;and, havin' spent 'most three months here, decides she
    wants to spend nine more anyhow.  She comes to the bank to cash a
    check, she and I get talkin', she tells me what she's lookin' for,
    I tell her I cal'late I've got a place in my eye that I think might
    be just the thing, and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He paused to bite the end from a cigar.  His friend finished the
    sentence for him.
</p>
<p>
    "And then," he said, "you, knowin' that I didn't want to let this
    house any time to anybody, naturally sent her down to look at it."
</p>
<p>
    "No such thing.  Course I knew that you'd OUGHT to let the house
    and, likin' the looks and ways of these Armstrong folks first rate,
    I give in that I had made up my mind TO send her down to look at
    it.  But, afore I could do it, the Almighty sent her on His own
    hook.  Which proves," he added, with a grin, "that my judgment has
    pretty good backin' sometimes."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Careful, Sam," he drawled, "careful.  The
    Kaiser'll be gettin' jealous of you if you don't look out.  But
    what," he inquired, "made her and the little girl move out of
    Middleford, or wherever 'twas they lived?  They could have found
    cheaper quarters there, couldn't they?  Course I ain't never been
    there, but seems as if they could."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin they could, but the fact of their movin' is what makes me
    pretty sure the widow's investments had turned sour.  It's a
    plaguey sight easier to begin to cut down and live economical in a
    place where nobody knows you than 'tis in one where everybody has
    known you for years.  See that, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed whistled sadly, breaking off in the middle of a bar to reply
    that he didn't know as he did.
</p>
<p>
    "I've never cut up, so cuttin' down don't worry me much," he
    observed.  "But I presume likely you're right, Sam; you generally
    are."  He whistled a moment longer, his gaze apparently fixed upon
    a point in the middle of the white plastered ceiling.  Then he
    said, dreamily: "Well, anyhow, 'twon't be but a month.  They'll go
    somewheres else in a month."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam sniffed.  "Bet you a dollar they won't," he retorted.
    "Not unless you turn 'em out.  And I see you turnin' anybody out."
</p>
<p>
    But Mr. Winslow looked hopeful.  "They'll go when the month's up,"
    he reiterated.  "Nobody could stand me more than a month.  Mother
    used to say so, and she'd known me longer than anybody."
</p>
<p>
    And so, in this curious fashion, did tenants come to the old
    Winslow house.  They moved in on the following Monday.  Jed saw the
    wagon with the trunks backing up to the door and he sighed.  Then
    he went over to help carry the trunks into the house.
</p>
<p>
    For the first week he found the situation rather uncomfortable; not
    as uncomfortable as he had feared, but a trifle embarrassing,
    nevertheless.  His new neighbors were not too neighborly; they did
    not do what he would have termed "pester" him by running in and out
    of the shop at all hours, nor did they continually ask favors.  On
    the other hand they did not, like his former tenants, the
    Davidsons, treat him as if he were some sort of odd wooden image,
    like one of his own weather vanes, a creature without feelings, to
    be displayed and "shown off" when it pleased them and ignored when
    it did not.  Mrs. Armstrong was always quietly cheerful and
    friendly when they met in the yard or about the premises, but she
    neither intruded nor patronized.  Jed's first impression of her, a
    favorable one, was strengthened daily.
</p>
<p>
    "I like her first-rate," he told Captain Sam.  "She ain't too
    folksy and she ain't too standoffish.  Why, honest truth, Sam," he
    added, ingenuously, "she treats me just the same as if I was like
    the common run of folks."
</p>
<p>
    The captain snorted.  "Gracious king!  Do stop runnin' yourself
    down," he commanded.  "Suppose you are a little mite&#8212;er&#8212;different
    from the&#8212;well, from the heft of mackerel in the keg, what of it?
    That's your own private business, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's lip twitched.  "I suppose 'tis," he drawled.  "If it wan't
    there wouldn't be so many folks interested in it."
</p>
<p>
    At first he missed the freedom to which he had accustomed himself
    during his years of solitude, the liberty of preparing for bed with
    the doors and windows toward the sea wide open and the shades not
    drawn; of strolling out to the well at unearthly hours of the early
    morning singing at the top of his lungs; of washing face and hands
    in a tin basin on a bench by that well curb instead of within
    doors.  There were some necessary concessions to convention to
    which his attention was called by Captain Hunniwell, who took it
    upon himself to act as a sort of social mentor.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you always wash outdoors there?" asked the captain, after
    watching one set of ablutions.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;er&#8212;yes, I 'most generally do in good weather.  It's sort of&#8212;
    er&#8212;well, sort of cool and roomy, as you might say."
</p>
<p>
    "Roomy, eh?  Gracious king!  Well, I should say you needed room.
    You splash into that basin like a kedge anchor goin' overboard and
    when you come out of it you puff like a grampus comin' up to blow.
    How do you cal'late Mrs. Armstrong enjoys seein' you do that?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked startled and much disturbed.  "Eh?" he exclaimed.  "Why,
    I never thought about her, Sam.  I declare I never did.  I&#8212;I'll
    fetch the wash basin inside this very minute."
</p>
<p>
    And he did.  The inconvenience attached to the breaking off of a
    summer-time habit of years troubled him not half as much as the
    fear that he might have offended a fellow creature's sensibilities.
    Jed Winslow was far too sensitive himself and his own feelings had
    been hurt too many times to make hurting those of another a small
    offense in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
    But these were minor inconveniences attached to his new position as
    landlord.  There were recompenses.  At work in his shop he could
    see through the window the white-clad, graceful figure of Mrs.
    Armstrong moving about the yard, sitting with Barbara on the bench
    by the edge of the bluff, or writing a letter at a table she had
    taken out under the shadow of the silver-leaf tree.  Gradually Jed
    came to enjoy seeing her there, to see the windows of the old house
    open, to hear voices once more on that side of the shop, and to
    catch glimpses of Babbie dancing in and out over the shining mica
    slab at the door.
</p>
<p>
    He liked the child when he first met her, but he had been a little
    fearful that, as a neighbor, she might trouble him by running in
    and out of the shop, interfering with his privacy and his work or
    making a small nuisance of herself when he was waiting on
    customers.  But she did none of these things, in fact she did not
    come into the shop at all and, after the first week had passed, he
    began to wonder why.  Late that afternoon, seeing her sitting on
    the bench by the bluff edge, her doll in her arms, he came out of
    the door of his little kitchen at the back of the shop and called
    her.
</p>
<p>
    "Good evenin'," he hailed.  "Takin' in the view, was you?"
</p>
<p>
    She bobbed her head.  "Yes, sir," she called in reply; "Petunia and
    I were looking at it."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Well, what do you and-er&#8212;What's-her-name think of it?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara pondered.  "We think it's very nice," she announced, after
    a moment.  "Don't you like it, Mr. Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, yes, I like it, I guess.  I ain't really had time to look
    at it to-day; been too busy."
</p>
<p>
    The child nodded, sympathetically.  "That's too bad," she said.
    Jed had, for him, a curious impulse, and acted upon it.
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe I might come and look at it now, if I was asked," he
    suggested.  "Plenty of room on that bench, is there?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes, sir, there's lots.  I don't take much room and Petunia
    almost always sits on my lap.  Please come."
</p>
<p>
    So Jed came and, sitting down upon the bench, looked off at the
    inlet and the beach and the ocean beyond.  It was the scene most
    familiar to him, one he had seen, under varying weather conditions,
    through many summers and winters.  This very thought was in his
    mind as he looked at it now.
</p>
<p>
    After a time he became aware that his companion was speaking.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he ejaculated, coming out of his reverie.  "Did you say
    somethin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, sir, three times.  I guess you were thinking, weren't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-m&#8212;yes, I shouldn't be surprised.  It's one of my bad habits,
    thinkin' is."
</p>
<p>
    She looked hard to see if he was smiling, but he was not, and she
    accepted the statement as a serious one.
</p>
<p>
    "Is thinking a bad habit?" she asked.  "I didn't know it was."
</p>
<p>
    "Cal'late it must be.  If it wasn't, more folks would do it.  Tell
    me, now," he added, changing the subject to avoid further cross-
    questioning, "do you and your ma like it here?"
</p>
<p>
    The answer was enthusiastic.  "Oh, yes!" she exclaimed, "we like it
    ever and ever so much.  Mamma says it's&#8212;"  Barbara hesitated, and
    then, after what was evidently a severe mental struggle, finished
    with, "she said once it was like paradise after category."
</p>
<p>
    "After&#8212;which?"
</p>
<p>
    The young lady frowned.  "It doesn't seem to me," she observed,
    slowly, "as if 'category' was what she said.  Does 'category' sound
    right to you, Mr. Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked doubtful.  "I shouldn't want to say that it did, right
    offhand like this," he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  I don't believe it was 'category.'  But I'm almost sure it
    was something about a cat, something a cat eats&#8212;or does&#8212;or
    something.  Mew&#8212;mouse&#8212;milk&#8212;" she was wrinkling her forehead and
    repeating the words to herself when Mr. Winslow had an inspiration.
</p>
<p>
    "'Twan't purgatory, was it?" he suggested.
</p>
<p>
    Miss Barbara's head bobbed enthusiastically.  "Purr-gatory, that
    was it," she declared.  "And it was something a cat does&#8212;purr,
    you know; I knew it was.  Mamma said living here was paradise
    after purr-gatory."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "I cal'late your ma didn't care much for the board at Luretta
    Smalley's," he observed.  He couldn't help thinking the remark an
    odd one to make to a child.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't think she meant Mrs. Smalley's," explained Barbara.
    "She liked Mrs. Smalley's pretty well, well as any one can like
    boarding, you know," this last plainly another quotation.  "I think
    she meant she liked living here so much better than she did living
    in Middleford, where we used to be."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum," was the only comment Jed made.  He was surprised,
    nevertheless.  Judged by what Captain Sam had told him, the
    Armstrong home at Middleford should have been a pleasant one.
    Barbara rattled on.
</p>
<p>
    "I guess that was it," she observed.  "She was sort of talking to
    herself when she said it.  She was writing a letter&#8212;to Uncle
    Charlie, I think it was&#8212;and I and Petunia asked her if she liked
    it here and she sort of looked at me without looking, same as you
    do sometimes, Mr. Winslow, when you're thinking of something else,
    and then she said that about the catty&#8212;no, the purr-gatory.  And
    when I asked her what purr-gatory meant she said, 'Never mind,'
    and. . . .  Oh, I forgot!" in consternation; "she told me I mustn't
    tell anybody she said it, either.  Oh, dear me!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed hastened to reassure her.  "Never mind," he declared, "I'll
    forget you ever did say it.  I'll start in forgettin' now.  In five
    minutes or so I'll have forgot two words of it already.  By to-
    morrow mornin' I wouldn't remember it for money."
</p>
<p>
    "Truly?"
</p>
<p>
    "Truly bluely, lay me down and cut me in twoly.  But what's this
    you're sayin' about your ma lookin' at things without seein' 'em,
    same as I do?  She don't do that, does she?"
</p>
<p>
    The young lady nodded.  "Yes," she said; "course not as bad&#8212;I mean
    not as often as you do, but sometimes, 'specially since&#8212;"  She
    hastily clapped her hand over her mouth.  "Oh!" she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    "What's the matter?  Toothache?"
</p>
<p>
    "No.  Only I almost told another somethin' I mustn't."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Well, I'm glad you put on the cover just in time."
</p>
<p>
    "So am I.  What else was I talking about?  Oh, yes, Mamma's
    thinking so hard, same as you do, Mr. Winslow.  You know," she
    added, earnestly, "she acts quite a lot like you sometimes."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her in horror.  "Good Lord!" he exclaimed.  Then, in
    his solemnest drawl, he added, "You tell her to take somethin' for
    it afore it's too late."
</p>
<p>
    As he rose from the bench he observed: "Haven't seen you over to
    the shop since you moved in.  I've been turnin' out another school
    of swordfish and whales, too.  Why don't you run in and look 'em
    over?"
</p>
<p>
    She clapped her hands.  "Oh, may I?" she cried.  "I've wanted to
    ever and ever so much, but Mamma said not to because it might annoy
    you.  Wouldn't it annoy you, TRULY?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not a bit."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, goody!  And might Petunia come, too?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Only," gravely, "she'll have to promise not to talk too
    much.  Think she'll promise that?  All right; then fetch her along."
</p>
<p>
    So, the very next morning, when Jed was busy at the bandsaw, he was
    not greatly surprised when the door opened and Miss Barbara
    appeared, with Petunia in her arms.  He was surprised, however, and
    not a little embarrassed when Mrs. Armstrong followed.
</p>
<p>
    "Good morning," said the lady, pleasantly.  "I came over to make
    sure that there hadn't been a mistake.  You really did ask Babby to
    come in and see you at work?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ma'am, I&#8212;I did.  I did, sartin."
</p>
<p>
    "And you don't mind having her here?  She won't annoy you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not a mite.  Real glad to have her."
</p>
<p>
    "Very well, then she may stay&#8212;an hour, but no longer.  Mind,
    Babby, dear, I am relying on you not to annoy Mr. Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    So the juvenile visitor stayed her hour and then obediently went
    away, in spite of Jed's urgent invitation to stay longer.  She had
    asked a good many questions and talked almost continuously, but Mr.
    Winslow, instead of being bored by her prattle, was surprised to
    find how empty and uninteresting the shop seemed after she had
    quitted it.
</p>
<p>
    She came again the next day and the next.  By the end of the week
    Jed had become sufficiently emboldened to ask her mother to permit
    her to come in the afternoon also.  This request was the result of
    a conspiracy between Barbara and himself.
</p>
<p>
    "You ask your ma," urged Jed.  "Tell her I say I need you here
    afternoons."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara looked troubled.  "But that would be a wrong story,
    wouldn't it?" she asked.  "You don't really need me, you know."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Yes, I do; yes, I do."
</p>
<p>
    "What for?  What shall I tell her you need me for?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed scratched his chin with the tail of a wooden whale.
</p>
<p>
    "You tell her," he drawled, after considering for a minute or two,
    "that I need you to help carry lumber."
</p>
<p>
    Even a child could not swallow this ridiculous excuse.  Barbara
    burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow!" she cried.  "You don't, either.  You know I
    couldn't carry lumber; I'm too little.  I couldn't carry any but
    the littlest, tiny bit."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, gravely.  "Yes, sartin," he agreed; "that's what I need
    you to carry.  You run along and tell her so, that's a good girl."
</p>
<p>
    But she shook her head vigorously.  "No," she declared.  "She would
    say it was silly, and it would be.  Besides, you don't really need
    me at all.  You just want Petunia and me for company, same as we
    want you.  Isn't that it, truly?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-m.  Well, I shouldn't wonder.  You can tell her that, if you
    want to; I'd just as soon."
</p>
<p>
    The young lady still hesitated.  "No-o," she said, "because she'd
    think perhaps you didn't really want me, but was too polite to say
    so.  If you asked her yourself, though, I think she'd let me come."
</p>
<p>
    At first Jed's bashfulness was up in arms at the very idea, but at
    length he considered to ask Mrs. Armstrong for the permission.  It
    was granted, as soon as the lady was convinced that the desire for
    more of her daughter's society was a genuine one, and thereafter

    Barbara visited the windmill shop afternoons as well as mornings.
    She sat, her doll in her arms, upon a box which she soon came to
    consider her own particular and private seat, watching her long-
    legged friend as he sawed or glued or jointed or painted.  He had
    little waiting on customers to do now, for most of the summer
    people had gone.  His small visitor and he had many long and, to
    them, interesting conversations.
</p>
<p>
    Other visitors to the shop, those who knew him well, were surprised
    and amused to find him on such confidential and intimate terms with
    a child.  Gabe Bearse, after one short call, reported about town
    that crazy Shavin's Winslow had taken up with a young-one just
    about as crazy as he was.
</p>
<p>
    "There she set," declared Gabriel, "on a box, hugging a broken-
    nosed doll baby up to her and starin' at me and Shavin's as if we
    was some kind of curiosities, as you might say.  Well, one of us
    was; eh?  Haw, haw!  She didn't say a word and Shavin's he never
    said nothin' and I felt as if I was preaching in a deef and dumb
    asylum.  Finally, I happened to look at her and I see her lips
    movin'.  'Well,' says I, 'you CAN talk, can't you, sis, even if
    it's only to yourself.  What was you talkin' to yourself about,
    eh?'  She didn't seem to want to answer; just sort of reddened up,
    you know; but I kept right after her.  Finally she owned up she was
    countin'.  'What was you countin'?' says I.  Well, she didn't want
    to tell that, neither.  Finally I dragged it out of her that she
    was countin' how many words I'd said since I started to tell about
    Melissy Busteed and what she said about Luther Small's wife's aunt,
    the one that's so wheezed up with asthma and Doctor Parker don't
    seem to be able to do nothin' to help.  'So you was countin' my
    words, was you?' says I.  'Well, that's good business, I must say!
    How many have I said?'  She looked solemn and shook her head.  'I
    had to give it up,' says she.  'It makes my head ache to count fast
    very long.  Doesn't it give you a headache to count fast, Mr.
    Winslow?'  Jed, he mumbled some kind of foolishness about some
    things givin' him earache.  I laughed at the two of 'em.  'Humph!'
    says I, 'the only kind of aches I have is them in my bones,'
    meanin' my rheumatiz, you understand.  Shavin's he looked moony up
    at the roof for about a week and a half, same as he's liable to do,
    and then he drawled out: 'You see he DOES have headache, Babbie,'
    says he.  Now did you ever hear such fool talk outside of an
    asylum?  He and that Armstrong kid are well matched.  No wonder she
    sits in there and gapes at him half the day."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam Hunniwell and his daughter were hugely tickled.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed's got a girl at last," crowed the captain.  "I'd about given
    up hope, Jed.  I was fearful that the bloom of your youth would
    pass away from you and you wouldn't keep company with anybody.
    You're so bashful that I know you'd never call on a young woman,
    but I never figured that one might begin callin' on you.  Course
    she's kind of extra young, but she'll grow out of that, give her
    time."
</p>
<p>
    Maud Hunniwell laughed merrily, enjoying Mr. Winslow's confusion.
    "Oh, the little girl is only the bait, Father," she declared.  "It
    is the pretty widow that Jed is fishing for.  She'll be calling
    here soon, or he'll be calling there.  Isn't that true, Jed?  Own
    up, now.  Oh, see him blush, Father!  Just see him!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, of course, denied that he was blushing.  His fair tormentor
    had no mercy.
</p>
<p>
    "You must be," she insisted.  "At any rate your face is very, very
    red.  I'll leave it to Father.  Isn't his face red, Father?"
</p>
<p>
    "Red as a flannel lung-protector," declared Captain Sam, who was
    never known to contradict his only daughter, nor, so report
    affirmed, deny a request of hers.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course it is," triumphantly.  "And it can't be the heat,
    because it isn't at all warm here."
</p>
<p>
    Poor Jed, the long-suffering, was goaded into a mild retort.
</p>
<p>
    "There's consider'ble hot air in here some spells," he drawled,
    mournfully.  Miss Hunniwell went away reaffirming her belief that
    Mr. Winslow's friendship for the daughter was merely a strategical
    advance with the mother as the ultimate objective.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll see, Father," she prophesied, mischievously.  "We shall
    hear of his 'keeping company' with Mrs. Armstrong soon.  Oh, he
    couldn't escape even if he wanted to.  These young widows are
    perfectly irresistible."
</p>
<p>
    When they were a safe distance from the windmill shop the captain
    cautioned his daughter.
</p>
<p>
    "Maud," he said, "you'd better not tease Jed too much about that
    good-lookin' tenant of his.  He's so queer and so bashful that I'm
    afraid if you do he'll take a notion to turn the Armstrongs out
    when this month's up."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
</p>
<p>
    "Suppose he does?" she asked.  "What of it?  She isn't a GREAT
    friend of yours, is she, Father?"
</p>
<p>
    It was the captain's turn to look embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    "No, no, course she ain't," he declared, hastily.  "All I've been
    thinkin' is that Jed ought to have a tenant in that house of his,
    because he needs the money.  And from what I've been able to find
    out about this Mrs. Armstrong she's a real nice genteel sort of
    body, and&#8212;and&#8212;er&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "And she's very sweet and very pretty and so, of course, naturally,
    all the men, especially the middle-aged men&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam interrupted explosively.  "Don't be so foolish!" he
    ordered.  "If you don't stop talkin' such nonsense I'll&#8212;I don't
    know what I'll do to you.  What do you suppose her bein' sweet and
    good-lookin' has got to do with me?  Gracious king!  I've got one
    good-lookin'&#8212;er&#8212;that is to say, I've got one young female to take
    care of now and that's enough, in all conscience."
</p>
<p>
    His daughter pinched his arm.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, ho!" she observed.  "You were going to say she was good-
    looking and then you changed your mind.  Don't you think this young
    female&#8212;WHAT a word! you ought to be ashamed of it&#8212;DON'T you think
    she is good-looking, Daddy, dear?"
</p>
<p>
    She looked provokingly up into his face and he looked fondly down
    into hers.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you?" she repeated.
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, I&#8212;I don't know as I'd want to go so far as to say that.  I
    presume likely her face might not stop a meetin'-house clock on a
    dark night, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    As they were in a secluded spot where a high hedge screened them
    from observation Miss Maud playfully boxed her parent's ears, a
    proceeding which he seemed to enjoy hugely.
</p>
<p>
    But there was reason in the captain's caution, nevertheless.  Miss
    Maud's "teasing" concerning the widow had set Jed to thinking.  The
    "trial" month was almost up.  In a little while he would have to
    give his decision as to whether the little Winslow house was to
    continue to be occupied by Barbara and her mother, or whether it
    was to be, as it had been for years, closed and shuttered tight.
    He had permitted them to occupy it for that month, on the spur of
    the moment, as the result of a promise made upon impulse, a
    characteristic Jed Winslow impulse.  Now, however, he must decide
    in cold blood whether or not it should be theirs for another eleven
    months at least.
</p>
<p>
    In his conversation with Captain Sam, the conversation which took
    place immediately after the Armstrongs came, he had stoutly
    maintained that the latter would not wish to stay longer than the
    month, that his own proximity as landlord and neighbor would be
    unbearable longer than that period.  But if the widow found it so
    she had so far shown no evidence of her disgust.  Apparently that
    means of breaking off the relationship could not be relied upon.
    Of course he did not know whether or not she wished to remain, but,
    if she did, did he wish her to do so?  There was nothing personal
    in the matter; it was merely the question as to whether his
    prejudice of years against renting that house to any one was to
    rule or be overthrown.  If she asked him for his decision what
    should he say?  At night, when he went to bed, his mind was made
    up.  In the morning when he arose it was unmade.  As he told
    Captain Hunniwell: "I'm like that old clock I used to have, Sam.
    The pendulum of that thing used to work fine, but the hands
    wouldn't move.  Same way with me.  I tick, tick, tick all day over
    this pesky business, but I don't get anywheres.  It's always half-
    past nothin'."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam was hugely disgusted.  "It ain't more'n quarter past,
    if it is that," he declared, emphatically.  "It's just nothin', if
    you ask me.  And say, speakin' of askin', I'd like to ask you this:
    How are you goin' to get 'em out, provided you're fool enough to
    decide they've got to go?  Are you goin' to tell Mrs. Armstrong
    right up and down and flat-footed that you can't stand any more of
    her?  I'd like to hear you say it.  Let me know when the show's
    goin' to come off.  I want a seat in the front row."
</p>
<p>
    Poor Jed looked aghast at the very idea.  His friend laughed
    derisively and walked off and left him.  And the days passed and
    the "trial month" drew closer and closer to its end until one
    morning he awoke to realize that that end had come; the month was
    up that very day.
</p>
<p>
    He had not mentioned the subject to the widow, nor had she to him.
    His reasons for not speaking were obvious enough; one was that he
    did not know what to say, and the other that he was afraid to say
    it.  But, as the time approached when the decision must be made, he
    had expected that she would speak.  And she had not.  He saw her
    daily, sometimes several times a day.  She often came into the shop
    to find Barbara, who made the workroom a playhouse on rainy or
    cloudy days, and she talked with him on other topics, but she did
    not mention this one.
</p>
<p>
    It was raining on this particular day, the last day in the "trial
    month," and Jed, working at his lathe, momentarily expected Barbara
    to appear, with Petunia under one arm and a bundle of dolls'
    clothes under the other, to announce casually that, as it was such
    bad weather, they had run in to keep him, Mr. Winslow, from getting
    lonesome.  There was precious little opportunity to be lonesome
    where Babbie was.
</p>
<p>
    But this morning the child did not come and Jed, wondering what the
    reason for her absence might be, began to feel vaguely
    uncomfortable.  Just what was the matter he did not know, but that
    there was something wrong with him, Jed Winslow, was plain.  He
    could not seem to keep his mind on his work; he found himself
    wandering to the window and looking out into the yard, where the
    lilac bushes whipped and thrashed in the gusts, the overflowing
    spouts splashed and gurgled, and the sea beyond the edge of the
    bluff was a troubled stretch of gray and white, seen through
    diagonal streaks of wind-driven rain.  And always when he looked
    out of that window he glanced toward the little house next door,
    hoping to see a small figure, bundled under a big rain coat and
    sheltered by a big umbrella, dodge out of the door and race across
    the yard toward the shop.
</p>
<p>
    But the door remained shut, the little figure did not appear and,
    except for the fact that the blinds were not closed and that there
    was smoke issuing from the chimney of the kitchen, the little house
    might have been as empty as it had been the month before.
</p>
<p>
    Or as it might be next month.  The thought came to Jed with a
    meaning and emphasis which it had not brought before.  A stronger
    gust than usual howled around the eaves of the shop, the sashes
    rattled, the panes were beaten by the flung raindrops which pounded
    down in watery sheets to the sills, and Jed suddenly diagnosed his
    own case, he knew what was the matter with him&#8212;he was lonesome;
    he, who had lived alone for five years and had hoped to live alone
    for the rest of his life, was lonesome.
</p>
<p>
    He would not admit it, even to himself; it was ridiculous.  He was
    not lonesome, he was just a little "blue," that was all.  It was
    the weather; he might have caught a slight cold, perhaps his
    breakfast had not agreed with him.  He tried to remember what that
    breakfast had been.  It had been eaten in a hurry, he had been
    thinking of something else as usual, and, except that it consisted
    of various odds and ends which he had happened to have on hand, he
    could not itemize it with exactness.  There had been some cold
    fried potatoes, and some warmed-over pop-overs which had "slumped"
    in the cooking, and a doughnut or two and&#8212;oh, yes, a saucer of
    canned peaches which had been sitting around for a week and which
    he had eaten to get out of the way.  These, with a cup of warmed-
    over coffee, made up the meal.  Jed couldn't see why a breakfast of
    that kind should make him "blue."  And yet he was blue&#8212;yes, and
    there was no use disguising the fact, he was lonesome.  If that
    child would only come, as she generally did, her nonsense might
    cheer him up a bit.  But she did not come.  And if he decided not
    to permit her mother to occupy the house, she would not come much
    more.  Eh?  Why, it was the last day of the month!  She might never
    come again!
</p>
<p>
    Jed shut off the motor and turned away from the lathe.  He sank
    down into his little chair, drew his knee up under his chin, and
    thought, long and seriously.  When the knee slid down to its normal
    position once more his mind was made up.  Mrs. Armstrong might
    remain in the little house&#8212;for a few months more, at any rate.
    Even if she insisted upon a year's lease it wouldn't do any great
    harm.  He would wait until she spoke to him about it and then he
    would give his consent.  And&#8212;and it would please Captain Sam, at
    any rate.
</p>
<p>
    He rose and, going to the window, looked out once more across the
    yard.  What he saw astonished him.  The back door of the house was
    partially open and a man was just coming out.  The man, in dripping
    oil-skins and a sou'wester, was Philander Hardy, the local
    expressman.  Philander turned and spoke to some one in the house
    behind him.  Jed opened the shop door a crack and listened.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ma'am," he heard Hardy say.  "I'll be back for 'em about four
    o'clock this afternoon.  Rain may let up a little mite by that
    time, and anyhow, I'll have the covered wagon.  Your trunks won't
    get wet, ma'am; I'll see to that."
</p>
<p>
    A minute later Jed, an old sweater thrown over his head and
    shoulders, darted out of the front door of his shop.  The express
    wagon with Hardy on the driver's seat was just moving off.  Jed
    called after it.
</p>
<p>
    "Hi, Philander!" he called, raising his voice only a little, for
    fear of being overheard at the Armstrong house.  "Hi, Philander,
    come here a minute.  I want to see you."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Hardy looked over his shoulder and then backed his equipage
    opposite the Winslow gate.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Jedidah Shavin's," he observed, with a grin.  "Didn't know
    you for a minute, with that shawl over your front crimps.  What you
    got on your mind; anything except sawdust?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was too much perturbed even to resent the loathed name "Jedidah."
</p>
<p>
    "Philander," he whispered, anxiously; "say, Philander, what does
    she want?  Mrs. Armstrong, I mean?  What is it you're comin' back
    for at four o'clock?"
</p>
<p>
    Philander looked down at the earnest face under the ancient
    sweater.  Then he winked, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I tell you, Shavin's," he said.  "You see, I don't know how
    'tis, but woman folks always seem to take a terrible shine to me.
    Now this Mrs. Armstrong here&#8212;  Say, she's some peach, ain't she!&#8212;
    she ain't seen me more'n half a dozen times, but here she is
    beggin' me to fetch her my photograph.  'It's rainin' pretty hard,
    to-day,' I says.  'Won't it do if I fetch it to-morrow?'  But no,
    she&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed held up a protesting hand.  "I don't doubt she wants your
    photograph, Philander," he drawled.  "Your kind of face is rare.
    But I heard you say somethin' about comin' for trunks.  Whose
    trunks?"
</p>
<p>
    "Whose?  Why, hers and the young-one's, I presume likely.  'Twas
    them I fetched from Luretta Smalley's.  Now she wants me to take
    'em back there."
</p>
<p>
    A tremendous gust, driven in from the sea, tore the sweater from
    the Winslow head and shoulders and wrapped it lovingly about one of
    the posts in the yard.  Jed did not offer to recover it; he
    scarcely seemed to know that it was gone.  Instead he stood staring
    at the express driver, while the rain ran down his nose and dripped
    from its tip to his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "She&#8212;she's goin' back to Luretta Smalley's?" he repeated.  "She&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He did not finish the sentence.  Instead he turned on his heel and
    walked slowly back to the shop.  The sweater, wrapped about the
    post where, in summer, a wooden sailor brandished his paddles,
    flapped soggily in the wind.  Hardy gazed after him.
</p>
<p>
    "What in time&#8212;?" he exclaimed.  Then, raising his voice, he
    called: "Hi, Jed!  Jed!  You crazy critter!  What&#8212;Jed, hold on a
    minute, didn't you know she was goin'?  Didn't she tell you?  Jed!"
</p>
<p>
    But Jed had entered the shop and closed the door.  Philander drove
    off, shaking his head and chuckling to himself.
</p>
<p>
    A few minutes later Mrs. Armstrong, hearing a knock at the rear
    door of the Winslow house, opened it to find her landlord standing
    on the threshold.  He was bareheaded and he had no umbrella.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow!" she exclaimed.  It was the first time that he
    had come to that house of his own accord since she had occupied it.
    Now he stood there, in the rain, looking at her without speaking.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow," she said again.  "What is it?  Come in, won't
    you?  You're soaking wet.  Come in!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked down at the sleeves of his jacket.  "Eh?" he drawled,
    slowly.  "Wet?  Why, I don't know's I ain't&#8212;a little.  It's&#8212;it's
    rainin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Raining!  It's pouring.  Come in."
</p>
<p>
    She took him by the arm and led him through the woodshed and into
    the kitchen.  She would have led him further, into the sitting-
    room, but he hung back.
</p>
<p>
    "No, ma'am, no," he said.  "I&#8212;I guess I'll stay here, if you don't
    mind."
</p>
<p>
    There was a patter of feet from the sitting-room and Barbara came
    running, Petunia in her arms.  At the sight of their visitor's
    lanky form the child's face brightened.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Mr. Winslow!" she cried.  "Did you come to see where Petunia
    and I were?  Did you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked down at her.  "Why&#8212;why, I don't know's I didn't," he
    admitted.  "I&#8212;I kind of missed you, I guess."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, and we missed you.  You see, Mamma said we mustn't go to the
    shop to-day because&#8212;  Oh, Mamma, perhaps he has come to tell you
    we won't have to&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong interrupted.  "Hush, Babbie," she said, quickly.  "I
    told Barbara not to go to visit you to-day, Mr. Winslow.  She has
    been helping me with the packing."
</p>
<p>
    Jed swallowed hard.  "Packin'?" he repeated.  "You've been packin'?
    Then 'twas true, what Philander Hardy said about your goin' back to
    Luretta's?"
</p>
<p>
    The lady nodded.  "Yes," she replied.  "Our month here ends to-day.
    Of course you knew that."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed miserably.  "Yes, ma'am," he said, "I knew it, but I
    only just realized it, as you might say.  I . . .  Hum! . . .
    Well . . ."
</p>
<p>
    He turned away and walked slowly toward the kitchen door.  Barbara
    would have followed but her mother laid a detaining hand upon her
    shoulder.  On the threshold of the door between the dining-room and
    kitchen Jed paused.
</p>
<p>
    "Ma'am," he said, hesitatingly, "you&#8212;you don't cal'late there's
    anything I can do to&#8212;to help, is there?  Anything in the packin'
    or movin' or anything like that?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, thank you, Mr. Winslow.  The packing was very simple."
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;yes, ma'am. . . .  Yes, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    He stopped, seemed about to speak again, but evidently changed his
    mind, for he opened the door and went out into the rain without
    another word.  Barbara, very much surprised and hurt, looked up
    into her mother's face.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mamma," she cried, "has&#8212;has he GONE?  He didn't say good-by
    to us or&#8212;or anything.  He didn't even say he was sorry we were
    going."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "I imagine that is because he isn't sorry, my dear," she replied.
    "You must remember that Mr. Winslow didn't really wish to let any
    one live in this house.  We only came here by&#8212;well, by accident."
</p>
<p>
    But Barbara was unconvinced.
</p>
<p>
    "He ISN'T glad," she declared, stoutly.  "He doesn't act that way
    when he is glad about things.  You see," she added, with the air of
    a Mrs. Methusaleh, "Petunia and I know him better than you do,
    Mamma; we've had more chances to get&#8212;to get acquainted."
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps an hour later there was another knock at the kitchen door.
    Mrs. Armstrong, when she opened it, found her landlord standing
    there, one of his largest windmills&#8212;a toy at least three feet
    high&#8212;in his arms.  He bore it into the kitchen and stood it in the
    middle of the floor, holding the mammoth thing, its peaked roof
    high above his head, and peering solemnly out between one of its
    arms and its side.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow!" exclaimed Mrs. Armstrong.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ma'am," said Jed.  "I&#8212;I fetched it for Babbie.  I just kind
    of thought maybe she'd like it."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara clasped her hands.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh!" she exclaimed.  "Oh, is it for me."
</p>
<p>
    Jed answered.
</p>
<p>
    "'Tis, if you want it," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Want it?  Why, Mamma, it's one of the very best mills!  It's a
    five dollar one, Mamma!"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong protested.  "Oh, I couldn't let you do that, Mr.
    Winslow," she declared.  "It is much too expensive a present.  And
    besides&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She checked herself just in time.  It had been on the tip of her
    tongue to say that she did not know what they could do with it.
    Their rooms at Mrs. Smalley's were not large.  It was as if a
    dweller in a Harlem flat had been presented with a hippopotamus.
</p>
<p>
    The maker of the mill looked about him, plainly seeking a place to
    deposit his burden.
</p>
<p>
    "'Tisn't anything much," he said, hastily.  "I&#8212;I'm real glad for
    you to have it."
</p>
<p>
    He was about to put it on top of the cookstove, in which there was
    a roaring fire, but Mrs. Armstrong, by a startled exclamation and a
    frantic rush, prevented his doing so.  So he put it on the table
    instead.  Barbara thanked him profusely.  She was overjoyed; there
    were no comparisons with hippopotami in HER mind.  Jed seemed
    pleased at her appreciation, but he did not smile.  Instead he
    sighed.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I just thought I wanted her to have it, ma'am," he said,
    turning to Mrs. Armstrong.  "'Twould keep her from&#8212;from forgettin'
    me altogether, maybe. . . .  Not that there's any real reason why
    she should remember me, of course," he added.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara was hurt and indignant.
</p>
<p>
    "Of COURSE I shan't forget you, Mr. Winslow," she declared.
    "Neither will Petunia.  And neither will Mamma, I know.  She feels
    awful bad because you don't want us to live here any longer, and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, Babbie, hush!" commanded her mother.  Barbara hushed, but
    she had said enough.  Jed turned a wondering face in their
    direction.  He stared without speaking.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong felt that some one must say something.
</p>
<p>
    "You mustn't mind what the child says, Mr. Winslow," she explained,
    hurriedly.  "Of course I realize perfectly that this house is yours
    and you certainly have the right to do what you please with your
    own.  And I have known all the time that we were here merely on
    trial."
</p>
<p>
    Jed lifted a big hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;er&#8212;just a minute, ma'am, please," he begged.  "I&#8212;I guess my
    wooden head is beginnin' to splinter or somethin'.  Please answer
    me just this&#8212;if&#8212;if you'd just as soon: Why are you movin' back to
    Luretta's?"
</p>
<p>
    It was her turn to look wonderingly at him.  "Why, Mr. Winslow,"
    she said, after a moment's hesitation, "isn't that rather an
    unnecessary question?  When Babbie and I came here it was with the
    understanding that we were to be on trial for a month.  We had gone
    into no details at all, except that the rent for this one month
    should be forty dollars.  You were, as I understood it, to consider
    the question of our staying and, if you liked us and liked the idea
    of renting the house at all, you were to come to me and discuss the
    matter.  The month is up and you haven't said a word on the
    subject.  And, knowing what your feelings HAD been, I of course
    realized that you did not wish us to remain, and so, of course, we
    are going.  I am sorry, very sorry.  Babbie and I love this little
    house, and we wish you might have cared to have us stay in it, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hold on! hold on!" Jed was, for him, almost energetic.  "Mrs.
    Armstrong, ma'am, do you mean to tell me you're goin' back to
    Luretta Smalley's because you think I don't want you to stay?  Is
    that it, honest truth?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, of course, it is.  What else?"
</p>
<p>
    "And&#8212;and 'tain't because you can't stand me any longer, same as
    Mother used to say?"
</p>
<p>
    "Can't stand you?  Your mother used to say?  What DO you mean, Mr.
    Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    "I mean&#8212;I mean you ain't goin' because I used to wash my face out
    in the yard, and&#8212;and holler and sing mornin's and look so
    everlastin' homely&#8212;and&#8212;and be what everybody calls a town crank&#8212;
    and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Mr. Winslow!  PLEASE!"
</p>
<p>
    "And&#8212;and you and Babbie would stay right here if&#8212;if you thought I
    wanted you to?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, of course.  But you don't, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    Before Jed could answer the outside door was thrown open without
    knock or preliminary warning, and Captain Sam Hunniwell, dripping
    water like a long-haired dog after a bath, strode into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    "Mornin', ma'am," he said, nodding to Mrs. Armstrong.  Then,
    turning to the maker of windmills: "You're the feller I'm lookin'
    for," he declared.  "Is what Philander Hardy told me just now true?
    Is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was dreamily staring out of the window.  He was smiling, a
    seraphic smile.  Receiving no reply, Captain Sam angrily repeated
    his question.  "Is it true?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o, no, I guess 'tisn't.  I'd know better if I knew what he told
    you."
</p>
<p>
    "He told me that Mrs. Armstrong here was movin' back to Luretta
    Smalley's to-day.  Jed Winslow, have you been big enough fool&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed held up the big hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said.  "I always am."
</p>
<p>
    "You always are&#8212;what?"
</p>
<p>
    "A big enough fool.  Sam, what is a lease?"
</p>
<p>
    "What is a lease?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Never mind tellin' me; show me.  Make out a lease of this
    house to Mrs. Armstrong here."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong was, naturally, rather surprised.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Mr. Winslow," she cried; "what are you talking about?  We
    haven't agreed upon rent or&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, we have.  We've agreed about everything.  Er&#8212;Babbie, you get
    your things on and come on over to the shop.  You and I mustn't be
    sittin' 'round here any longer.  We've got to get to WORK."

<p>
    And so, in as sudden a fashion as he had granted the "month's
    trial," did Jed grant the permanent tenure of his property.  The
    question of rent, which might easily have been, with the ordinary
    sort of landlord, a rock in the channel, turned out to be not even
    a pebble.  Captain Hunniwell, who was handling the business
    details, including the making out of the lease, was somewhat
    troubled.
</p>
<p>
    "But, Jed," he protested, "you've GOT to listen to me.  She won't
    pay forty a month, although she agrees with me that for a furnished
    house in a location like this it's dirt cheap.  Of course she's
    takin' it for all the year, which does make consider'ble
    difference, although from May to October, when the summer folks are
    here, I could get a hundred and forty a month just as easy as . . .
    Eh?  I believe you ain't heard a word I've been sayin'.  Gracious
    king!  If you ain't enough to drive the mate of a cattle boat into
    gettin' religion!  Do you hear me?  I say she won't pay&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, who was sitting before the battered old desk in the corner of
    his workshop, did not look around, but he waved his right hand, the
    fingers of which held the stump of a pencil, over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Ssh-h, sh-h, Sam!" he observed, mildly.  "Don't bother me now;
    please don't, there's a good feller.  I'm tryin' to work out
    somethin' important."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, this is important.  Or, if it ain't, there's plenty that is
    important waitin' for me up at the bank.  I'm handlin' this house
    business as a favor to you.  If you think I've got nothin' else to
    do you're mistaken."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, contritely, and turned to face his friend.  "I know it,
    Sam," he said, "I know it.  I haven't got the least mite of excuse
    for troublin' you."
</p>
<p>
    "You ain't troublin' me&#8212;not that way.  All I want of you is to say
    yes or no.  I tell you Mrs. Armstrong thinks she can't afford to
    pay forty a month."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "And perhaps she can't.  But you've got your own interests to think
    about.  What shall I do?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "YES!  What in time are you sayin' yes for?"
</p>
<p>
    "Hum?  Eh?  Oh, excuse me, Sam; I didn't mean yes, I mean no."
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!"
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;er&#8212;er&#8212;," desperately, "you told me to say yes or no, so I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "See here, Jed Winslow, HAVE you heard what I've been sayin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, no, Sam; honest I ain't.  I've run across an idea about
    makin' a different kind of mill&#8212;one like a gull, you know, that'll
    flap its wings up and down when the wind blows&#8212;and&#8212;er&#8212;I'm afraid
    my head is solid full of that and nothin' else.  There generally
    ain't more'n room for one idea in my head," he added, apologetically.
    "Sometimes that one gets kind of cramped."
</p>
<p>
    The captain snorted in disgust.  Jed looked repentant and distressed.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm awful sorry, Sam," he declared.  "But if it's about that house
    of mine&#8212;rent or anything, you just do whatever Mrs. Armstrong says."
</p>
<p>
    "Whatever SHE says?  Haven't you got anything to say?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, no-o, I don't know's I have.  You see, I've settled that she
    and Babbie are to have the house for as long as they want it, so
    it's only fair to let them settle the rest, seems to me.  Whatever
    Mrs. Armstrong wants to pay'll be all right.  You just leave it to
    her."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam rose to his feet.
</p>
<p>
    "I've a dum good mind to," he declared "'Twould serve you right if
    she paid you ten cents a year."  Then, with a glance of disgust at
    the mountain of old letters and papers piled upon the top of the
    desk where his friend was at work, he added: "What do you clean
    that desk of yours with&#8212;a shovel?"
</p>
<p>
    The slow smile drifted across the Winslow face.  "I cal'late that's
    what I should have to use, Sam," he drawled, "if I ever cleaned
    it."
</p>
<p>
    The captain and the widow agreed upon thirty-five dollars a month.
    It developed that she owned their former house in Middleford and
    that the latter had been rented for a very much higher rent.  "My
    furniture," she added, "that which I did not sell when we gave up
    housekeeping, is stored with a friend there.  I know it is
    extravagant, my hiring a furnished house, but I'm sure Mr. Winslow
    wouldn't let this one unfurnished and, besides, it would be a crime
    to disturb furniture and rooms which fit each other as these do.
    And, after all, at the end of a year I may wish to leave Orham.  Of
    course I hope I shall not, but I may."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam would have asked questions concerning her life in
    Middleford, in fact he did ask a few, but the answers he received
    were unsatisfactory.  Mrs. Armstrong evidently did not care to talk
    on the subject.  The captain thought her attitude a little odd, but
    decided that the tragedy of her husband's death must be the cause
    of her reticence.  Her parting remarks on this occasion furnished
    an explanation.
</p>
<p>
    "If you please, Captain Hunniwell," she said, "I would rather you
    did not tell any one about my having lived in Middleford and my
    affairs there.  I have told very few people in Orham and I think on
    the whole it is better not to.  What is the use of having one's
    personal history discussed by strangers?"
</p>
<p>
    She was evidently a trifle embarrassed and confused as she said
    this, for she blushed just a little.  Captain Sam decided that the
    blush was becoming.  Also, as he walked back to the bank, he
    reflected that Jed Winslow's tenant was likely to have her personal
    history and affairs discussed whether she wished it or not.  Young
    women as attractive as she were bound to be discussed, especially
    in a community the size of Orham.  And, besides, whoever else she
    may have told, she certainly had told him that Middleford had
    formerly been her home and he had told Maud and Jed.  Of course
    they would say nothing if he asked them, but perhaps they had told
    it already.  And why should Mrs. Armstrong care, anyway?
</p>
<p>
    "Let folks talk," he said that evening, in conversation with his
    daughter.  "Let 'em talk, that's my motto.  When they're lyin'
    about me I know they ain't lyin' about anybody else, that's some
    comfort.  But women folks, I cal'late, feel different."
</p>
<p>
    Maud was interested and a little suspicious.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't suppose, Pa," she said, "that this Mrs. Armstrong has a
    past, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "A past?  What kind of a thing is a past, for thunder sakes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, I mean a&#8212;a&#8212;well, has she done something she doesn't want
    other people to know; is she trying to hide something, like&#8212;well,
    as people do in stories?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, in the books!  I see.  Well, young woman, I cal'late the
    first thing for your dad to do is to find out what sort of books
    you read.  A past!  Ho, ho!  I guess likely Mrs. Armstrong is a
    plaguey sight more worried about the future than she is about the
    past.  She has lived the past already, but she's got to live the
    future and pay the bills belongin' to it, and that's no triflin'
    job in futures like these days."
</p>
<p>
    Needless to say Jed Winslow did no speculating concerning his
    tenant's "past."  Having settled the question of that tenancy
    definitely and, as he figured it, forever, he put the matter
    entirely out of his mind and centered all his energies upon the new
    variety of mill, the gull which was to flap its wings when the wind
    blew.  Barbara was, of course, much interested in the working out
    of this invention, and her questions were many.  Occasionally Mrs.
    Armstrong came into the shop.  She and Jed became better acquainted.
</p>
<p>
    The acquaintanceship developed.  Jed formed a daily habit of
    stopping at the Armstrong door to ask if there were any errands to
    be done downtown.  "Goin' right along down on my own account,
    ma'am," was his invariable excuse.  "Might just as well run your
    errands at the same time."  Also, whenever he chopped a supply of
    kindling wood for his own use he chopped as much more and filled
    the oilcloth-covered box which stood by the stove in the Armstrong
    kitchen.  He would not come in and sit down, however, in spite of
    Barbara's and her mother's urgent invitation; he was always too
    "busy" for that.
</p>
<p>
    But the time came when he did come in, actually come in and sit
    down to a meal.  Barbara, of course, was partially responsible for
    this amazing invitation, but it was Heman Taylor's old brindle
    tomcat which really brought it to pass.  The cat in question was a
    disreputable old scalawag, with tattered ears and a scarred hide,
    souvenirs of fights innumerable, with no beauty and less morals,
    and named, with appropriate fitness, "Cherub."
</p>
<p>
    It was a quarter to twelve on a Sunday morning and Jed was
    preparing his dinner.  The piece de resistance of the dinner was,
    in this instance, to be a mackerel.  Jed had bought the mackerel of
    the fish peddler the previous afternoon and it had been reposing on
    a plate in the little ancient ice-chest which stood by the back
    door of the Winslow kitchen.  Barbara, just back from Sunday school
    and arrayed in her best, saw that back door open and decided to
    call.  Jed, as always, was glad to see her.
</p>
<p>
    "You're getting dinner, aren't you, Mr. Winslow?" she observed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her over his spectacles.  "Yes," he answered.
    "Unless somethin' happens I'm gettin' dinner."
</p>
<p>
    His visitor looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, whatever happened you would be getting dinner just the same,
    wouldn't you?" she said.  "You might not have it, but you'd be
    getting it, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed took the mackerel out of the ice-chest and put the plate
    containing it on the top of the latter.  "We-ell," he drawled, "you
    can't always tell.  I might take so long gettin' it that, first
    thing I knew, 'twould be supper."
</p>
<p>
    Humming a hymn he took another dish from the ice-chest and placed
    it beside the mackerel plate.
</p>
<p>
    "What's that?" inquired Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    "That?  Oh, that's my toppin'-off layer.  That's a rice puddin',
    poor man's puddin', some folks call it.  I cal'late your ma'd call
    it a man's poor puddin', but it makes good enough ballast for a
    craft like me."  He began singing again.
</p>
<pre>     "'I know not, yea, I know not
       What bliss awaits me there.
       Di, doo de di di doo de&#8212;'"
</pre>
<p>
    Breaking off to suggest: "Better stay and eat along with me to-day,
    hadn't you, Babbie?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara tried hard not to seem superior.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you," she said, "but I guess I can't.  We're going to have
    chicken and lemon jelly."  Then, remembering her manners, she
    added: "We'd be awful glad if you'd have dinner with us, Mr.
    Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "Much obliged," he drawled, "but if I didn't eat that mackerel, who
    would?"
</p>
<p>
    The question was answered promptly.  While Mr. Winslow and his
    small caller were chatting concerning the former's dinner, another
    eager personality was taking a marked interest in a portion of that
    dinner.  Cherub, the Taylor cat, abroad on a foraging expedition,
    had scented from his perch upon a nearby fence a delicious and
    appetizing odor.  Following his nose, literally, Cherub descended
    from the fence and advanced, sniffing as he came.  The odor was
    fish, fresh fish.  Cherub's green eyes blazed, his advance became
    crafty, strategical, determined.  He crept to the Winslow back
    step, he looked up through the open door, he saw the mackerel upon
    its plate on the top of the ice-chest.
</p>
<p>
    "If I didn't eat that mackerel," drawled Jed, "who would?"

<p>
    There was a swoop through the air, a scream from Barbara, a crash&#8212;
    two crashes, a momentary glimpse of a brindle cat with a mackerel
    crosswise in its mouth and the ends dragging on the ground, a
    rattle of claws on the fence.  Then Jed and his visitor were left
    to gaze upon a broken plate on the floor, an overturned bowl on top
    of the ice-chest, and a lumpy rivulet of rice pudding trickling to
    the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh! Oh! Oh!" cried Barbara, wringing her hands in consternation.
</p>
<p>
    Jed surveyed the ruin of the "poor man's pudding" and gazed
    thoughtfully at the top of the fence over which the marauder had
    disappeared.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum," he mused.  "H-u-u-m. . . .  Well, I did cal'late I could get
    a meal out of sight pretty fast myself, but&#8212;but&#8212;I ain't in that
    critter's class."
</p>
<p>
    "But your dinner!" wailed Barbara, almost in tears.  "He's spoiled
    ALL your dinner!  Oh, the BAD thing!  I hate that Cherub cat!  I
    HATE him!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow rubbed his chin.  "We-e-ll," he drawled again.  "He
    does seem to have done what you might call a finished job.
    H-u-u-m! . . .  'Another offensive on the&#8212;er&#8212;no'theast'ard
    front; all objectives attained.'  That's the way the newspapers
    tell such things nowadays, ain't it? . . .  However, there's no
    use cryin' over spilt&#8212;er&#8212;puddin'.  Lucky there's eggs and milk
    aboard the ship.  I shan't starve, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara was aghast.  "Eggs and milk!" she repeated.  "Is THAT all
    you've got for Sunday dinner, Mr. Winslow?  Why, that's awful!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled and began picking up the fragments of the plate.  He
    went to the closet to get a broom and when he came out again the
    young lady had vanished.
</p>
<p>
    But she was back again in a few minutes, her eyes shining.
</p>
<p>
    "Mr. Winslow," she said, "Mamma sent me to ask if you could please
    come right over to our house.  She&#8212;she wants to see you."
</p>
<p>
    Jed regarded her doubtfully.  "Wants to see me?" he repeated.
    "What for?"
</p>
<p>
    The child shook her head; her eyes sparkled more than ever.  "I'm
    not sure," she said, "but I think there's something she wants you
    to do."
</p>
<p>
    Wondering what the something might be, Jed promised to be over in a
    minute or two.  Barbara danced away, apparently much excited.  Mr.
    Winslow, remembering that it was Sunday, performed a hasty toilet
    at the sink, combed his hair, put on his coat and walked across the
    yard.  Barbara met him at the side door of the house.
</p>
<p>
    "Mamma's in the dining-room," she said.  "Come right in, Mr.
    Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    So Jed entered the dining-room, to find the table set and ready,
    with places laid for three instead of two, and Mrs. Armstrong
    drawing back one of three chairs.  He looked at her.
</p>
<p>
    "Good mornin', ma'am," he stammered.  "Babbie, she said&#8212;er&#8212;she
    said there was somethin' you wanted me to do."
</p>
<p>
    The lady smiled.  "There is," she replied.  "Babbie has told me
    what happened to your dinner, and she and I want you to sit right
    down and have dinner with us.  We're expecting you, everything is
    ready, and we shall&#8212;yes, we shall be hurt if you don't stay.
    Shan't we, Babbie?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara nodded vigorously.  "Awf'ly," she declared; "'specially
    Petunia.  You will stay, won't you, Mr. Winslow&#8212;please?"
</p>
<p>
    Poor Jed!  His agitation was great, his embarrassment greater and
    his excuses for not accepting the invitation numerous if not
    convincing.  But at last he yielded and sat reluctantly down to the
    first meal he had eaten in that house for five years.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong, realizing his embarrassment, did not urge him to
    talk and Barbara, although she chattered continuously, did not seem
    to expect answers to her questions.  So Jed ate a little, spoke a
    little, and thought a great deal.  And by the time dinner was over
    some of his shyness and awkwardness had worn away.  He insisted
    upon helping with the dishes and, because she saw that he would be
    hurt if she did not, his hostess permitted him to do so.
</p>
<p>
    "You see, ma'am," he said, "I've been doin' dishes for a
    consider'ble spell, more years than I like to count.  I ought to be
    able to do 'em fair to middlin' well.  But," he added, as much to
    himself as to her, "I don't know as that's any sign.  There's so
    many things I ought to be able to do like other folks&#8212;and can't.
    I'm afraid you may not be satisfied, after all, ma'am," he went on.
    "I suppose you're a kind of an expert, as you might say."
</p>
<p>
    She shook her head.  "I fear I'm no expert, Mr. Winslow," she
    answered, just a little sadly, so it seemed to him.  "Barbara and I
    are learning, that is all."
</p>
<p>
    "Nora used to do the dishes at home," put in Barbara.  "Mamma
    hardly ever&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, dear," interrupted her mother.  "Mr. Winslow wouldn't be
    interested."
</p>
<p>
    After considerable urging Jed consented to sit a while in the
    living-room.  He was less reluctant to talk by this time and, the
    war creeping into the conversation, as it does into all
    conversations nowadays, they spoke of recent happenings at home and
    abroad.  Mrs. Armstrong was surprised to find how well informed her
    landlord was concerning the world struggle, its causes and its
    progress.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, no, ma'am," he said, in answer to a remark of hers; "I ain't
    read it up much, as I know of, except in the newspapers.  I ain't
    an educated man.  Maybe&#8212;" with his slow smile&#8212;"maybe you've
    guessed as much as that already."
</p>
<p>
    "I know that you have talked more intelligently on this war than
    any one else I have heard since I came to this town," she declared,
    emphatically.  "Even Captain Hunniwell has never, in my hearing,
    stated the case against Germany as clearly as you put it just now;
    and I have heard him talk a good deal."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was evidently greatly pleased, but he characteristically tried
    not to show it.  "Well, now, ma'am," he drawled, "I'm afraid you
    ain't been to the post office much mail times.  If you'd just drop
    in there some evenin' and hear Gabe Bearse and Bluey Batcheldor
    raise hob with the Kaiser you'd understand why the confidence of
    the Allies is unshaken, as the Herald gave out this mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    A little later he said, reflectively:
</p>
<p>
    "You know, ma'am, it's an astonishin' thing to me, I can't get over
    it, my sittin' here in this house, eatin' with you folks and
    talkin' with you like this."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong smiled.  "I can't see anything so very astonishing
    about it," she said.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly not.  Why shouldn't you do it&#8212;often?  We are landlord
    and tenant, you and I, but that is no reason, so far as I can see,
    why we shouldn't be good neighbors."
</p>
<p>
    He shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know's you quite understand, ma'am," he said.  "It's your
    thinkin' of doin' it, your askin' me and&#8212;and WANTIN' to ask me
    that seems so kind of odd.  Do you know," he added, in a burst of
    confidence, "I don't suppose that, leavin' Sam Hunniwell out,
    another soul has asked me to eat at their house for ten year.
    Course I'm far from blamin' 'em for that, you understand, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Wait.  Mr. Winslow, you had tenants in this house before?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes'm.  Davidson, their names was."
</p>
<p>
    "And did THEY never invite you here?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her, then away, out of the window.  It was a moment
    or two before he answered.  Then&#8212;
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Armstrong," he said, "you knew, I cal'late, that I was&#8212;er&#8212;
    kind of prejudiced against rentin' anybody this house after the
    Davidsons left?"
</p>
<p>
    The lady, trying not to smile, nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," she replied, "I&#8212;well, I guessed as much."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes'm, I was.  They would have took it again, I'm pretty sartin,
    if I'd let 'em, but&#8212;but somehow I couldn't do it.  No, I couldn't,
    and I never meant anybody else should be here.  Seems funny to you,
    I don't doubt."
</p>
<p>
    "Why, no, it was your property to do what you pleased with, and I
    am sure you had a reason for refusing."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes'm.  But I ain't ever told anybody what that reason was.  I've
    told Sam a reason, but 'twan't the real one.  I&#8212;I guess likely
    I'll tell it to you.  I imagine 'twill sound foolish enough.  'Twas
    just somethin' I heard Colonel Davidson say, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    He paused.  Mrs. Armstrong did not speak.  After an interval he
    continued:
</p>
<p>
    "'Twas one day along the last of the season.  The Davidsons had
    company and they'd been in to see the shop and the mills and vanes
    and one thing or 'nother.  They seemed nice, pleasant enough folks;
    laughed a good deal, but I didn't mind that.  I walked out into the
    yard along with 'em and then, after I left 'em, I stood for a
    minute on the front step of the shop, with the open door between me
    and this house here.  A minute or so later I heard 'em come into
    this very room.  They couldn't see me, 'count of the door, but I
    could hear them, 'count of the windows bein' open.  And then . . .
    Huh . . . Oh, well."
</p>
<p>
    He sighed and lapsed into one of his long fits of abstraction.  At
    length Mrs. Armstrong ventured to remind him.
</p>
<p>
    "And then&#8212;?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, yes, ma'am!  Well, then I heard one of the comp'ny say:
    'I don't wonder you enjoy it here, Ed,' he says.  'That landlord of
    yours is worth all the rent you pay and more.  'Tain't everybody
    that has a dime museum right on the premises.'  All hands laughed
    and then Colonel Davidson said: 'I thought you'd appreciate him,'
    he says.  'We'll have another session with him before you leave.
    Perhaps we can get him into the house here this evenin'.  My wife
    is pretty good at that, she jollies him along.  Oh, he swallows it
    all; the poor simpleton don't know when he's bein' shown off.'"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong uttered an exclamation.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh!" she cried.  "The brute!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes'm," said Jed, quietly, "that was what he said.  You see," with
    an apologetic twitch of the lip, "it came kind of sudden to me and&#8212;
    and it hurt.  Fact is, I&#8212;I had noticed he and his wife was&#8212;er&#8212;
    well, nice and&#8212;er&#8212;folksy, as you might say, but I never once
    thought they did it for any reason but just because they&#8212;well,
    liked me, maybe.  Course I'd ought to have known better.  Fine
    ladies and gentlemen like them don't take much fancy to dime museum
    folks."
</p>
<p>
    There was just a trace of bitterness in his tone, the first Mrs.
    Armstrong had ever noticed there.  Involuntarily she leaned toward
    him.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't, Mr. Winslow," she begged.  "Don't think of it again.  They
    must have been beasts, those people, and they don't deserve a
    moment's thought.  And DON'T call them ladies and gentlemen.  The
    only gentleman there was yourself."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "If you said that around the village here," he drawled, "somebody
    might be for havin' you sent to the asylum up to Taunton.  Course
    I'm much obliged to you, but, honest, you hadn't ought to take the
    risk."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong smiled slightly, but hers was a forced smile.  What
    she had just heard, told in her guest's quaint language as a
    statement of fact and so obviously with no thought of effect, had
    touched her more than any plea for sympathy could have done.  She
    felt as if she had a glimpse into this man's simple, trusting,
    sensitive soul.  And with that glimpse came a new feeling toward
    him, a feeling of pity&#8212;yes, and more than that, a feeling of
    genuine respect.
</p>
<p>
    He sighed again and rose to go.  "I declare," he said,
    apologetically, "I don't know what I've been botherin' you with all
    this for.  As I said, I've never told that yarn to anybody afore
    and I never meant to tell it.  I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But she interrupted him.  "Please don't apologize," she said.  "I'm
    very glad you told it to me."
</p>
<p>
    "I cal'late you think it's a queer reason for lettin' this house
    stand empty all this time."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I think it was a very good one, and Babbie and I are honored
    to know that your estimate of us is sufficiently high to overcome
    your prejudice."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, ma'am, I&#8212;I guess it's goin' to be all right.  If you feel
    you can get along with me for a landlord I'd ought sartin to be
    willin' to have you for tenants.  Course I don't blame the
    Davidsons, in one way, you understand, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "I do.  I blame them in every way.  They must have been unspeakable.
    Mr. Winslow, I hope you will consider Babbie and me not merely
    tenants and neighbors, but friends&#8212;real friends."
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not reply for at least a minute.  Then he said: "I'm afraid
    you'll be kind of lonesome; my friends are like corn sprouts in a
    henyard, few and scatterin'."
</p>
<p>
    "So much the better; we shall feel that we belong to select
    company."
</p>
<p>
    He did not thank her nor answer, but walked slowly on through the
    dining-room and kitchen, where he opened the door and stepped out
    upon the grass.  There he stood for a moment, gazing at the sky,
    alternately puckering his lips and opening them, but without saying
    a word.  Mrs. Armstrong and Barbara, who had followed him, watched
    these facial gymnastics, the lady with astonishment, her daughter
    with expectant interest.
</p>
<p>
    "I know what he is doing that for, Mamma," she whispered.  "It's
    because he's thinking and don't know whether to whistle or not.
    When he thinks AWFUL hard he's almost sure to whistle&#8212;or sing."
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, hush, Babbie!"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, he won't hear us.  He hardly ever hears any one when he's
    thinking like that.  And see, Mamma, he IS going to whistle."
</p>
<p>
    Sure enough, their guest whistled a few mournful bars, breaking off
    suddenly to observe:
</p>
<p>
    "I hope there wan't any bones in it."
</p>
<p>
    "Bones in what?  What do you mean, Mr. Winslow?" queried Mrs.
    Armstrong, who was puzzled, to say the least.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, I hope there wan't any bones in that mackerel Heman's cat
    got away with.  If there was it might choke or somethin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Good gracious!  I shouldn't worry over that possibility, if I were
    you.  I should scarcely blame you for wishing it might choke, after
    stealing your dinner."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow shook his head.  "That wouldn't do," solemnly.  "If it
    choked it couldn't ever steal another one."
</p>
<p>
    "But you don't WANT it to steal another one, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "We-ll, if every one it stole meant my havin' as good an afternoon
    as this one's been, I'd&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped.  Barbara ventured to spur him on.
</p>
<p>
    "You'd what?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "I'd give up whittlin' weather vanes and go mackerel-seinin' for
    the critter's benefit.  Well&#8212;er&#8212;good day, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    "Good afternoon, Mr. Winslow.  We shall expect you again soon.  You
    must be neighborly, for, remember, we are friends now."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was half way across the yard, but he stopped and turned.
</p>
<p>
    "My&#8212;my FRIENDS generally call me 'Jed,'" he said.  Then, his face
    a bright red, he hurried into the shop and closed the door.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VIII
</h2>
<p>
    After this, having broken the ice, Jed, as Captain Sam Hunniwell
    might have expressed it, "kept the channel clear."  When he stopped
    at the kitchen door of his tenants' house he no longer invariably
    refused to come in and sit down.  When he inquired if Mrs.
    Armstrong had any errands to be done he also asked if there were
    any chores he might help out with.  When the old clock&#8212;a genuine
    Seth Willard&#8212;on the wall of the living-room refused to go, he came
    in, sat down, took the refractory timepiece in his arms and, after
    an hour of what he called "putterin' and jackleggin'," hung it up
    again apparently in as good order as ever.  During the process he
    whistled a little, sang a hymn or two, and talked with Barbara, who
    found the conversation a trifle unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
    "He hardly EVER finished what he was going to say," she confided to
    her mother afterward.  "He'd start to tell me a story and just as
    he got to the most interesting part something about the clock would
    seem to&#8212;you know&#8212;trouble him and he'd stop and, when he began
    again, he'd be singing instead of talking.  I asked him what made
    him do it and he said he cal'lated his works must be loose and
    every once in a while his speaking trumpet fell down into his music
    box.  Isn't he a funny man, Mamma?"
</p>
<p>
    "He is indeed, Babbie."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Petunia and I think he's&#8212;he's perfectly scrushe-aking.
    'Twas awful nice of him to fix our clock, wasn't it, Mamma."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, dear."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  And I know why he did it; he told me.  'Twas on Petunia's
    account.  He said not to let her know it but he'd taken
    consider'ble of a shine to her.  I think he's taken a shine to me,
    don't you, Mamma?"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure of it."
</p>
<p>
    "So am I.  And I 'most guess he's taken one to you, too.  Anyhow he
    watches you such a lot and notices so many things.  He asked me to-
    day if you had been crying.  I said no.  You hadn't, had you,
    Mamma?"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong evaded the question by changing the subject.  She
    decided she must be more careful in hiding her feelings when her
    landlord was about.  She had had no idea that he could be so
    observing; certainly he did not look it.
</p>
<p>
    But her resolution was a little late.  Jed had made up his mind
    that something was troubling his fair tenant.  Again and again, now
    that he was coming to know her better and better, he had noticed
    the worn, anxious look on her face, and once before the day of the
    clock repairing he had seen her when it seemed to him that she had
    been crying.  He did not mention his observations or inferences to
    any one, even Captain Sam, but he was sure he was right.  Mrs.
    Armstrong was worried and anxious and he did not like the idea.  He
    wished he might help her, but of course he could not.  Another man,
    a normal man, one not looked upon by a portion of the community as
    "town crank," might have been able to help, might have known how to
    offer his services and perhaps have them accepted, but not he, not
    Jedidah Edgar Wilfred Winslow.  But he wished he could.  She had
    asked him to consider her a real friend, and to Jed, who had so
    few, a friend was a possession holy and precious.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile the war was tightening its grip upon Orham as upon every
    city, town and hamlet in the land.  At first it had been a thing to
    read about in the papers, to cheer for, to keep the flags flying.
    But it had been far off, unreal.  Then came the volunteering, and
    after that the draft, and the reality drew a little nearer.  Work
    upon the aviation camp at East Harniss had actually begun.  The
    office buildings were up and the sheds for the workmen.  They were
    erecting frames for the barracks, so Gabriel Bearse reported.  The
    sight of a uniform in Orham streets was no longer such a novelty as
    to bring the population, old and young, to doors and windows.  Miss
    Maud Hunniwell laughingly confided to Jed that she was beginning to
    have hopes, real hopes, of seeing genuine gold lace some day soon.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam, her father, was busy.  Sessions of the Exemption Board
    were not quite as frequent as at first, but the captain declared
    them frequent enough.  And volunteering went on steadily here and
    there among young blood which, having drawn a low number in the
    draft, was too impatient for active service to wait its turn.
    Gustavus Howes, bookkeeper at the bank, was one example.  Captain
    Sam told Jed about it on one of his calls.
</p>
<p>
    "Yep," he said, "Gus has gone, cleared out yesterday afternoon.
    Goin' to one of the trainin' camps to try to learn to be an
    officer.  Eh?  What did I say to him?  Why, I couldn't say nothin',
    could I, but 'Hurrah' and 'God bless you'?  But it's leavin' a bad
    hole in the bank just the same."
</p>
<p>
    Jed asked if the bank had any one in view to fill that hole.
    Captain Sam looked doubtful.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he replied, "we've got somebody in view that would like to
    try and fill it.  Barzilla Small was in to see me yesterday
    afternoon and he's sartin that his boy Luther&#8212;Lute, everybody
    calls him&#8212;is just the one for the place.  He's been to work up in
    Fall River in a bank, so Barzilla says; that would mean he must
    have had some experience.  Whether he'll do or not I don't know,
    but he's about the only candidate in sight, these war times.  What
    do you think of him, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "To fill Gus Howes' place?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, of course.  Didn't think I was figgerin' on makin' him
    President of the United States, did you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Hum! . . .  W-e-e-ll. . . .  One time when I was a little shaver,
    Sam, down to the fishhouse, I tried on a pair of Cap'n Jabe Kelly's
    rubber boots.  You remember Cap'n Jabe, Sam, of course.  Do you
    remember his feet?"
</p>
<p>
    The captain chuckled.  "My dad used to say Jabe's feet reminded him
    of a couple of chicken-halibut."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm. . . .  Well, I tried on his boots and started to walk
    across the wharf in em. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, what of it?  Gracious king! hurry up.  What happened?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, nothin' much, only seemed to me I'd had half of my
    walk afore those boots began to move."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell enjoyed the story hugely.  It was not until his
    laugh had died away to a chuckle that its application to the bank
    situation dawned upon him.
</p>
<p>
    "Umph!" he grunted.  "I see.  You cal'late that Lute Small will
    fill Gus Howes' job about the way you filled those boots, eh?  You
    may be right, shouldn't wonder if you was, but we've got to have
    somebody and we've got to have him now.  So I guess likely we'll
    let Lute sign on and wait till later to find out whether he's an
    able seaman or a&#8212;a&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He hesitated, groping for a simile.  Mr. Winslow supplied one.
</p>
<p>
    "Or a leak," he suggested.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, that's it.  Say, have you heard anything from Leander Babbitt
    lately?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, nothin' more than Gab Bearse was reelin' off last time he was
    in here.  How is Phin Babbitt?  Does he speak to you yet?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not a word.  But the looks he gives me when we meet would sour
    milk.  He's dead sartin that I had somethin' to do with his boy's
    volunteerin' and he'll never forgive me for it.  He's the best hand
    at unforgivin' I ever saw.  No, no!  Wonder what he'd say if he
    knew 'twas you, Jed, that was really responsible?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head, but made no reply.  His friend was at the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Any money to take to the bank?" he inquired.  "Oh, no, I took what
    you had yesterday, didn't I?  Any errands you want done over to
    Harniss?  Maud and I are goin' over there in the car this
    afternoon."
</p>
<p>
    Jed seemed to reflect.  "No-o," he said; "no, I guess not. . . .
    Why, yes, I don't know but there is, though.  If you see one of
    those things the soldiers put on in the trenches I'd wish you'd buy
    it for me.  You know what I mean&#8212;a gas mask."
</p>
<p>
    "A gas mask!  Gracious king!  What on earth?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "'Twould be consider'ble protection when Gabe Bearse
    dropped in and started talkin'," he drawled, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
    October came in clear and fine and on a Saturday in that month Jed
    and Barbara went on their long anticipated picnic to the aviation
    camp at East Harniss.  The affair was one which they had planned
    together.  Barbara, having heard much concerning aviation during
    her days of playing and listening in the windmill shop, had asked
    questions.  She wished to know what an aviation was.  Jed had
    explained, whereupon his young visitor expressed a wish to go and
    see for herself.  "Couldn't you take Petunia and me some time, Mr.
    Winslow?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Guess maybe so," was the reply, "provided I don't forget it, same
    as you forget about not callin' me Mr. Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I'm so sorry.  Petunia ought to have reminded me.  Can't you
    take me some time, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    He had insisted upon her dropping the "Mr." in addressing him.
    "Your ma's goin' to call me Jed," he told her; "that is to say, I
    hope she is, and you might just as well.  I always answer fairly
    prompt whenever anybody says 'Jed,' 'cause I'm used to it.  When
    they say 'Mr. Winslow' I have to stop and think a week afore I
    remember who they mean."
</p>
<p>
    But Barbara, having consulted her mother, refused to address her
    friend as "Jed."  "Mamma says it wouldn't be respect&#8212;respectaful,"
    she said.  "And I don't think it would myself.  You see, you're
    older than I am," she added.
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded gravely.  "I don't know but I am, a little, now you
    remind me of it," he admitted.  "Well, I tell you&#8212;call me 'Uncle
    Jed.'  That's got a handle to it but it ain't so much like the
    handle to an ice pitcher as Mister is.  'Uncle Jed' 'll do, won't
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara pondered.  "Why," she said, doubtfully, "you aren't my
    uncle, really.  If you were you'd be Mamma's brother, like&#8212;like
    Uncle Charlie, you know."
</p>
<p>
    It was the second time she had mentioned "Uncle Charlie."  Jed had
    never heard Mrs. Armstrong speak of having a brother, and he
    wondered vaguely why.  However, he did not wonder long on this
    particular occasion.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" he grunted.  "Well, let's see.  I tell you: I'll be your
    step-uncle.  That'll do, won't it?  You've heard of step-fathers?
    Um-hm.  Well, they ain't real fathers, and a step-uncle ain't a
    real uncle.  Now you think that over and see if that won't fix it
    first-rate."
</p>
<p>
    The child thought it over.  "And shall I call you 'Step-Uncle
    Jed'?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Um. . . .  No-o, I guess I wouldn't.  I'm only a back
    step-uncle, anyway&#8212;I always come to the back steps of your house,
    you know&#8212;so I wouldn't say anything about the step part.  You ask
    your ma and see what she says."
</p>
<p>
    So Barbara asked and reported as follows:
</p>
<p>
    "She says I may call you 'Uncle Jed' when it's just you and I
    together," she said.  "But when other people are around she thinks
    'Mr. Winslow' would be more respectaful."
</p>
<p>
    It was settled on that basis.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't you take me to the aviation place sometime, Uncle Jed?"
    asked Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    Jed thought he could, if he could borrow a boat somewhere and Mrs.
    Armstrong was willing that Barbara should go with him.  Both
    permission and the boat were obtained, the former with little
    difficulty, after Mrs. Armstrong had made inquiries concerning Mr.
    Winslow's skill in handling a boat, the latter with more.  At last
    Captain Perez Ryder, being diplomatically approached, told Jed he
    might use his eighteen foot power dory for a day, the only cost
    being that entailed by purchase of the necessary oil and gasoline.
</p>
<p>
    It was a beautiful morning when they started on their six mile
    sail, or "chug," as Jed called it.  Mrs. Armstrong had put up a
    lunch for them, and Jed had a bucket of clams, a kettle, a pail of
    milk, some crackers, onions and salt pork, the ingredients of a
    possible chowder.
</p>
<p>
    "Little mite late for 'longshore chowder picnics, ma'am," he said,
    "but it's a westerly wind and I cal'late 'twill be pretty balmy in
    the lee of the pines.  Soon's it gets any ways chilly we'll be
    startin' home.  Wish you were goin' along, too."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong smiled and said she wished it had been possible for
    her to go, but it was not.  She looked pale that morning, so it
    seemed to Jed, and when she smiled it was with an obvious effort.
</p>
<p>
    "You're not going without locking your kitchen door, are you, Mr.
    Jed?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her and at the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Why," he observed, "I ain't locked that door, have I!  I locked
    the front one, the one to the shop, though.  Did you see the sign I
    tacked on the outside of it?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I didn't."
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't know but you might have.  I put on it: 'Closed for the
    day.  Inquire at Abijah Thompson's.'  You see," he added, his eye
    twinkling ever so little, "'Bije Thompson lives in the last house
    in the village, two mile or more over to the west'ard."
</p>
<p>
    "He does!  Then why in the world did you tell people to inquire
    there?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, if I didn't they'd be botherin' you, probably, and I didn't
    want 'em doin' that.  If they want me enough to travel way over to
    'Bije's they'll come back here to-morrow, I shouldn't wonder.  I
    guess likely they'd have to; 'Bije don't know anything about me."
</p>
<p>
    He rubbed his chin and then added:
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe 'twould be a good notion to lock that kitchen door."
</p>
<p>
    They were standing at the edge of the bluff.  He sauntered over to
    the kitchen, closed the door, and then, opening the window beside
    it, reached in through that window and turned the key in the lock
    of the door.  Leaving the key in that lock and the window still
    open, he came sauntering back again.
</p>
<p>
    "There," he drawled, "I guess everything's safe enough now."
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong regarded him in amused wonder.  "Do you usually lock
    your door on the inside in that way?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, yes'm.  If I locked it on the outside I'd have to
    take the key with me, and I'm such an absent-minded dumb-head, I'd
    be pretty sure to lose it.  Come on, Babbie.  All aboard!"

<h2>
    CHAPTER IX
</h2>
<p>
    The "Araminta," which was the name of Captain Perez's power dory&#8212;a
    name, so the captain invariably explained, "wished onto her" before
    he bought her&#8212;chugged along steadily if not swiftly.  The course
    was always in protected water, inside the outer beaches or through
    the narrow channels between the sand islands, and so there were no
    waves to contend with and no danger.  Jed, in the course of his
    varied experience afloat and ashore, had picked up a working
    knowledge of gasoline engines and, anyhow, as he informed his small
    passenger, the "Araminta's" engine didn't need any expert handling.
    "She runs just like some folks' tongues; just get her started and
    she'll clack along all day," he observed, adding philosophically,
    "and that's a good thing&#8212;in an engine."
</p>
<p>
    "I know whose tongue you're thinking about, Uncle Jed," declared
    Barbara.  "It's Mr. Gabe Bearse's."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was much amused; he actually laughed aloud.  "Gabe and this
    engine are different in one way, though," he said.  "It's within
    the bounds of human possibility to stop this engine."
</p>
<p>
    They threaded the last winding channel and came out into the bay.
    Across, on the opposite shore, the new sheds and lumber piles of
    what was to be the aviation camp loomed raw and yellow in the
    sunlight.  A brisk breeze ruffled the blue water and the pines on
    the hilltops shook their heads and shrugged their green shoulders.
    The "Araminta" chugged across the bay, rising and falling ever so
    little on the miniature rollers.
</p>
<p>
    "What shall we do, Uncle Jed?" asked Barbara.  "Shall we go to see
    the camp or shall we have our chowder and luncheon first and then
    go?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed took out his watch, shook it and held it to his ear&#8212;a
    precautionary process rendered necessary because of his habit of
    forgetting to wind it&#8212;then after a look at the dial, announced
    that, as it was only half-past ten, perhaps they had better go to
    the camp first.
</p>
<p>
    "You see," he observed, "if we eat now we shan't hardly know
    whether we're late to breakfast or early to dinner."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara was surprised.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Uncle Jed!" she exclaimed, "I had breakfast ever so long ago!
    Didn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I had it about the same time you did, I cal'late.  But my
    appetite's older than yours and it don't take so much exercise; I
    guess that's the difference.  We'll eat pretty soon.  Let's go and
    look the place over first."
</p>
<p>
    They landed in a little cove on the beach adjoining the Government
    reservation.  Jed declared it a good place to make a fire, as it
    was sheltered from the wind.  He anchored the boat at the edge of
    the channel and then, pulling up the tops of his long-legged rubber
    boots, carried his passenger ashore.  Another trip or two landed
    the kettle, the materials for the chowder and the lunch baskets.
    Jed looked at the heap on the beach and then off at the boat.
</p>
<p>
    "Now," he said, slowly, "the question is what have I left aboard
    that I ought to have fetched ashore and what have I fetched here
    that ought to be left there? . . .  Hum. . . .  I wonder."
</p>
<p>
    "What makes you think you've done anything like that, Uncle Jed?"
    asked Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, I don't think it, I know it.  I've boarded with
    myself for forty-five year and I know if there's anything I can get
    cross-eyed I'll do it.  Just as likely as not I've made the bucket
    of clams fast to that rope out yonder and hove it overboard, and
    pretty soon you'll see me tryin' to make chowder out of the
    anchor. . . .  Ah hum. . . well. . . .
</p>
<pre>    'As numberless as the sands on the seashore,
       As numberless as the sands on the shore,
     Oh, what a sight 'twill be, when the ransomed host we see,
       As numberless as&#8212;'
</pre>
<p>
    Well, what do you say?  Shall we heave ahead for the place where
    Uncle Sam's birds are goin' to nest&#8212;his two-legged birds, I mean?"
</p>
<p>
    They walked up the beach a little way, then turned inland, climbed
    a dune covered with beachgrass and emerged upon the flat meadows
    which would soon be the flying field.  They walked about among the
    sheds, the frames of the barracks, and inspected the office
    building from outside.  There were gangs of workmen, carpenters,
    plumbers and shovelers, but almost no uniforms.  Barbara was
    disappointed.
</p>
<p>
    "But there ARE soldiers here," she declared.  "Mamma said there
    were, officer soldiers, you know."
</p>
<p>
    "I cal'late there ain't very many yet," explained her companion.
    "Only the few that's in charge, I guess likely.  By and by there'll
    be enough, officers and men both, but now there's only carpenters
    and such."
</p>
<p>
    "But there are SOME officer ones&#8212;" insisted Babbie.  "I wonder&#8212;
    Oh, see, Uncle Jed, through that window&#8212;see, aren't those
    soldiers?  They've got on soldier clothes."
</p>
<p>
    Jed presumed likely that they were.  Barbara nodded, sagely.  "And
    they're officers, too," she said, "I'm sure they are because
    they're in the office.  Do they call them officers because they
    work in offices, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    After an hour's walking about they went back to the place where
    they had left the boat and Jed set about making the chowder.
    Barbara watched him build the fire and open the clams, but then,
    growing tired of sitting still, she was seized with an idea.
</p>
<p>
    "Uncle Jed," she asked, "can't you whittle me a shingle boat?  You
    know you did once at our beach at home.  And there's the cunningest
    little pond to sail it on.  Mamma would let me sail it there, I
    know, 'cause it isn't a bit deep.  You come and see, Uncle Jed."
</p>
<p>
    The "pond" was a puddle, perhaps twenty feet across, left by the
    outgoing tide.  Its greatest depth was not more than a foot.  Jed
    absent-mindedly declared the pond to be safe enough but that he
    could not make a shingle boat, not having the necessary shingle.
</p>
<p>
    "Would you if you had one?" persisted the young lady.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, yes, sartin, I guess so."
</p>
<p>
    "All right.  Here is one.  I picked it up on top of that little
    hill.  I guess it blew there.  It's blowing ever so much harder up
    there than it is here on the beach."
</p>
<p>
    The shingle boat being hurriedly made, its owner begged for a paper
    sail.  "The other one you made me had a paper sail, Uncle Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed pleaded that he had no paper.  "There's some wrapped 'round the
    lunch," he said, "but it's all butter and such.  'Twouldn't be any
    good for a sail.  Er&#8212;er&#8212;don't you think we'd better put off
    makin' the sail till we get home or&#8212;or somewheres?  This chowder
    is sort of on my conscience this minute."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie evidently did not think so.  She went away on an exploring
    expedition.  In a few minutes she returned, a sheet of paper in her
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    "It was blowing around just where I found the shingle," she
    declared.  "It's a real nice place to find things, up on that hill
    place, Uncle Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed took the paper, looked at it absently&#8212;he had taken off his
    coat during the fire-building and his glasses were presumably in
    the coat pocket&#8212;and then hastily doubled it across, thrust the
    mast of the "shingle boat" through it at top and bottom, and handed
    the craft to his small companion.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he observed; "there she is, launched, rigged and all but
    christened.  Call her the&#8212;the 'Geranium'&#8212;the 'Sunflower'&#8212;what's
    the name of that doll baby of yours?  Oh, yes, the 'Petunia.'  Call
    her that and set her afloat."
</p>
<p>
    But Barbara shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "I think," she said, "if you don't mind, Uncle Jed, I shall call
    this one 'Ruth,' that's Mamma's name, you know.  The other one you
    made me was named for Petunia, and we wouldn't want to name 'em ALL
    for her.  It might make her too&#8212;too&#8212;  Oh, what ARE those things
    you make, Uncle Jed?  In the shop, I mean."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Windmills?"
</p>
<p>
    "No.  The others&#8212;those you tell the wind with.  I know&#8212;vanes.  It
    might make Petunia too vain.  That's what Mamma said I mustn't be
    when I had my new coat, the one with the fur, you know."
</p>
<p>
    She trotted off.  Jed busied himself with the chowder.  A few
    minutes later a voice behind him said: "Hi, there!"  He turned to
    see a broad-shouldered stranger, evidently a carpenter or workman
    of some sort, standing at the top of the sand dune and looking down
    at him with marked interest.
</p>
<p>
    "Hi, there!" repeated the stranger.
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded; his attention was centered on the chowder.  "How d'ye
    do?" he observed, politely.  "Nice day, ain't it? . . .  Hum. . . .
    About five minutes more."
</p>
<p>
    The workman strode down the bank.
</p>
<p>
    "Say," he demanded, "have you seen anything of a plan?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Hum. . . .  Two plates and two spoons . . . and two
    tumblers. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "Hey!  Wake up!  Have you seen anything of a plan, I ask you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  A plan? . . .  No, I guess not. . . .  No, I ain't. . . .
    What is it?"
</p>
<p>
    "What IS it?  How do you know you ain't seen it if you don't know
    what it is?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  I don't, I guess likely."
</p>
<p>
    "Say, you're a queer duck, it strikes me.  What are you up to?
    What are you doin' here, anyway?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed took the cover from the kettle and stirred the fragrant,
    bubbling mass with a long-handled spoon.
</p>
<p>
    "About done," he mused, slowly.  "Just . . . about . . . done.
    Give her two minutes more for luck and then. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    But his visitor was becoming impatient.  "Are you deaf or are you
    tryin' to get my goat?" he demanded.  "Because if you are you're
    pretty close to doin' it, I'll tell you that.  You answer when I
    speak to you; understand?  What are you doin' here?"
</p>
<p>
    His tone was so loud and emphatic that even Mr. Winslow could not
    help but hear and understand.  He looked up, vaguely troubled.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I hope you'll excuse me, Mister," he stammered.  "I'm afraid I
    haven't been payin' attention the way I'd ought to.  You see, I'm
    makin' a chowder here and it's just about got to the place where
    you can't&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Look here, you," began his questioner, but he was interrupted in
    his turn.  Over the edge of the bank came a young man in the khaki
    uniform of the United States Army.  He was an officer, a second
    lieutenant, and a very young and very new second lieutenant at
    that.  His face was white and he seemed much agitated.
</p>
<p>
    "What's the matter here?" he demanded.  Then, seeing Jed for the
    first time, he asked: "Who is this man and what is he doing here?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's just what I was askin' him, sir," blustered the workman.
    "I found him here with this fire goin' and I asked him who he was
    and what he was doin'.  I asked him first if he'd seen the plan&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Had he?" broke in the young officer, eagerly.  Then, addressing
    Jed, he said: "Have you seen anything of the plan?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed slowly shook his head.  "I don't know's I know what you mean by
    a plan," he explained.  "I ain't been here very long.  I just&#8212;  My
    soul and body!"
</p>
<p>
    He snatched the kettle from the fire, took off the cover, sniffed
    anxiously, and then added, with a sigh of relief, "Whew!  I declare
    I thought I smelt it burnin'.  Saved it just in time.  Whew!"
</p>
<p>
    The lieutenant looked at Jed and then at the workman.  The latter
    shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't ask me, sir," he said.  "That's the way he's been actin'
    ever since I struck here.  Either he's batty or else he's
    pretendin' to be, one or the other.  Look here, Rube!" he roared at
    the top of his lungs, "can the cheap talk and answer the
    lieutenant's questions or you'll get into trouble.  D'ye hear?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up at him.  "I'm pretty nigh sure I should hear if you
    whispered a little louder," he said, gently.
</p>
<p>
    The young officer drew himself up.  "That's enough of this," he
    ordered.  "A plan has been lost here on this reservation, a
    valuable plan, a drawing of&#8212;well, a drawing that has to do with
    the laying out of this camp and which might be of value to the
    enemy if he could get it.  It was on my table in the office less
    than an hour ago.  Now it is missing.  What we are asking you is
    whether or not you have seen anything of it.  Have you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.  "I don't think I have," he replied.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't think?  Don't you know?  What is the matter with you?
    Is it impossible for you to answer yes or no to a question?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um&#8212;why, yes, I cal'late 'tis&#8212;to some questions."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, by George!  You're fresh enough."
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, if you please, I wasn't intendin' to be fresh.  I just&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you are.  Who is this fellow?  How does he happen to be
    here?  Does any one know?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's first interrogator, the big workman, being the only one
    present beside the speaker and the object of the question, took it
    upon himself to answer.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know who he is," he said.  "And he won't tell why he's
    here.  Looks mighty suspicious to me.  Shouldn't wonder if he was a
    German spy.  They're all around everywheres, so the papers say."
</p>
<p>
    This speech had a curious effect.  The stoop in the Winslow
    shoulders disappeared.  Jed's tall form straightened.  When he
    spoke it was in a tone even more quiet and deliberate than usual,
    but there could be no shadow of a doubt that he meant what he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Excuse me, Mister," he drawled, "but there's one or two names that
    just now I can't allow anybody to call me.  'German' is one and
    'spy' is another.  And you put 'em both together.  I guess likely
    you was only foolin', wasn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    The workman looked surprised.  Then he laughed.  "Shall I call a
    guard, sir?" he asked, addressing the lieutenant.  "Better have him
    searched, I should say.  Nine chances to one he's got the plan in
    his pocket."
</p>
<p>
    The officer&#8212;he was very young&#8212;hesitated.  Jed, who had not taken
    his eyes from the face of the man who had called him a German spy,
    spoke again.
</p>
<p>
    "You haven't answered me yet," he drawled.  "You was only foolin'
    when you said that, wasn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    The lieutenant, who may have felt that he had suddenly become a
    negligible factor in the situation, essayed to take command of it.
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up," he ordered, addressing Winslow.  Then to the other,
    "Yes, call a guard.  We'll see if we can't get a straight answer
    from this fellow.  Hurry up."
</p>
<p>
    The workman turned to obey.  But, to his surprise, his path was
    blocked by Jed, who quietly stepped in front of him.
</p>
<p>
    "I guess likely, if you wasn't foolin', you'd better take back what
    you called me," said Jed.
</p>
<p>
    They looked at each other.  The workman was tall and strong, but
    Jed, now that he was standing erect, was a little taller.  His
    hands, which hung at his sides, were big and his arms long.  And in
    his mild blue eye there was a look of unshakable determination.
    The workman saw that look and stood still.
</p>
<p>
    "Hurry up!" repeated the lieutenant.
</p>
<p>
    Just how the situation might have ended is uncertain.  How it did
    end was in an unexpected manner.  From the rear of the trio, from
    the top of the sandy ridge separating the beach from the meadow, a
    new voice made itself heard.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Rayburn, what's the trouble?" it asked.
</p>
<p>
    The lieutenant turned briskly, so, too, did Mr. Winslow and his
    vis-a-vis.  Standing at the top of the ridge was another officer.
    He was standing there looking down upon them and, although he was
    not smiling, Jed somehow conceived the idea that he was much amused
    about something.  Now he descended the ridge and walked toward the
    group by the fire.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Rayburn, what is it?" he asked again.
</p>
<p>
    The lieutenant saluted.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, Major Grover," he stammered, "we&#8212;that is I found this
    man here on the Government property and&#8212;and he won't explain what
    he's doing here.  I&#8212;I asked him if he had seen anything of the
    plan and he won't answer.  I was just going to put him under arrest
    as&#8212;as a suspicious person when you came."
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover turned and inspected Jed, and Jed, for his part,
    inspected the major.  He saw a well set-up man of perhaps thirty-
    five, dark-haired, brown-eyed and with a closely clipped mustache
    above a pleasant mouth and a firm chin.  The inspection lasted a
    minute or more.  Then the major said:
</p>
<p>
    "So you're a suspicious character, are you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's hand moved across his chin in the gesture habitual with him.
</p>
<p>
    "I never knew it afore," he drawled.  "A suspicious character is an
    important one, ain't it?  I&#8212;er&#8212;I'm flattered."
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  Well, you realize it now, I suppose?"
</p>
<p>
    "Cal'late I'll have to, long's your&#8212;er&#8212;chummie there says it's
    so."
</p>
<p>
    The expression of horror upon Lieutenant Rayburn's face at hearing
    himself referred to as "chummie" to his superior officer was worth
    seeing.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I say, sir!" he explained.  The major paid no attention.
</p>
<p>
    "What were you and this man," indicating the big carpenter,
    "bristling up to each other for?" he inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, this guy he&#8212;" began the workman.  Major Grover motioned him
    to be quiet.
</p>
<p>
    "I asked the other fellow," he said.  Jed rubbed his chin once
    more.
</p>
<p>
    "He said I was a German spy," he replied.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you?"
</p>
<p>
    "No."  The answer was prompt enough and emphatic enough.  Major
    Grover tugged at the corner of his mustache.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I&#8212;I admit you don't look it," he observed, dryly.  "What's
    your name and who are you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed told his name, his place of residence and his business.
</p>
<p>
    "Is there any one about here who knows you, who could prove you
    were who you say you are?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow considered.  "Ye-es," he drawled.  "Ye-es, I guess so.
    'Thoph Mullett and 'Bial Hardy and Georgie T. Nickerson and
    Squealer Wixon, they're all carpenterin' over here and they're from
    Orham and know me.  Then there's Bluey Batcheldor and Emulous Baker
    and 'Gawpy'&#8212;I mean Freddie G.&#8212;and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "There, there!  That's quite sufficient, thank you.  Do you know
    any of those men?" he asked, turning to the workman.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, sir, I guess I do."
</p>
<p>
    "Very well.  Go up and bring two of them here; not more than two,
    understand."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's accuser departed.  Major Grover resumed his catechizing.
</p>
<p>
    "What were you doing here?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Me?  Oh, I was just picnicin', as you might say, along with a
    little girl, daughter of a neighbor of mine.  She wanted to see
    where the soldiers was goin' to fly, so I borrowed Perez Ryder's
    power dory and we came over.  'Twas gettin' along dinner time and I
    built a fire so as to cook. . . .  My soul!" with a gasp of
    consternation, "I forgot all about that chowder.  And now it's got
    stone cold.  Yes, sir!" dropping on his knees and removing the
    cover of the kettle, "stone cold or next door to it.  Ain't that a
    shame!"
</p>
<p>
    Lieutenant Rayburn snorted in disgust.  His superior officer,
    however, merely smiled.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind the chowder just now," he said.  "So you came over here
    for a picnic, did you?  Little late for picnics, isnt it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;ye-es," drawled Jed, "'tis kind of late, but 'twas a nice,
    moderate day and Babbie she wanted to come, so&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Babbie?  That's the little girl? . . .  Oh," with a nod, "I
    remember now.  I saw a man with a little girl wandering about among
    the buildings a little while ago.  Was that you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es, yes, that was me. . . .  Tut, tut, tut!  I'll have to warm
    this chowder all up again now.  That's too bad!"
</p>
<p>
    Voices from behind the ridge announced the coming of the carpenter
    and the two "identifiers."  The latter, Mr. Emulous Baker and Mr.
    "Squealer" Wixon, were on the broad grin.
</p>
<p>
    "Yup, that's him," announced Mr. Wixon.  "Hello, Shavin's!  Got you
    took up for a German spy, have they?  That's a good one! haw, haw!"
</p>
<p>
    "Do you know him?" asked the major.
</p>
<p>
    "Know him?" Mr. Wixon guffawed again.  "Known him all my life.  He
    lives over to Orham.  Makes windmills and whirlagigs and such for
    young-ones to play with.  HE ain't any spy.  His name's Jed
    Winslow, but we always call him 'Shavin's,' 'count of his whittlin'
    up so much good wood, you understand.  Ain't that so, Shavin's?
    Haw, haw!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed regarded Mr. Wixon mournfully.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," he admitted.  "I guess likely you're right, Squealer."
</p>
<p>
    "I bet you!  There's only one Shavin's in Orham."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "There's consider'ble many squealers," he drawled;
    "some in sties and some runnin' loose."
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover, who had appeared to enjoy this dialogue, interrupted
    it now.
</p>
<p>
    "That would seem to settle the spy question," he said.  "You may
    go, all three of you," he added, turning to the carpenters.  They
    departed, Jed's particular enemy muttering to himself and Mr. Wixon
    laughing uproariously.  The major once more addressed Jed.
</p>
<p>
    "Where is the little girl you were with?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, she's over yonder just 'round the p'int, sailin' a
    shingle boat I made her.  Shall I call her?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, it isn't necessary.  Mr. Winslow, I'm sorry to have put you to
    all this trouble and to have cooled your&#8212;er&#8212;chowder.  There is no
    regulation against visitors to our reservation here just now,
    although there will be, of course, later on.  There is a rule
    against building fires on the beach, but you broke that in
    ignorance, I'm sure.  The reason why you have been cross-questioned
    to-day is a special one.  A construction plan has been lost, as
    Lieutenant Rayburn here informed you.  It was on his desk in the
    office and it has disappeared.  It may have been stolen, of course,
    or, as both windows were open, it may have blown away.  You are
    sure you haven't seen anything of it?  Haven't seen any papers
    blowing about?"
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure it didn't blow away, sir," put in the lieutenant.  "I'm
    positive it was stolen.  You see&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He did not finish his sentence.  The expression upon Jed's face
    caused him to pause.  Mr. Winslow's mouth and eyes were opening
    wider and wider.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" muttered Jed.  "Sho, now! . . .  'Tain't possible that . . .
    I snum if . . .  Sho!"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, what is it?" demanded both officers, practically in concert.
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not reply.  Instead he turned his head, put both hands to
    his mouth and shouted "Babbie!" through them at the top of his
    lungs.  The third shout brought a faint, "Yes, Uncle Jed, I'm
    coming."
</p>
<p>
    "What are you calling her for?" asked Lieutenant Rayburn,
    forgetting the presence of his superior officer in his anxious
    impatience.  Jed did not answer.  He was kneeling beside his
    jacket, which he had thrown upon the sand when he landed, and was
    fumbling in the pockets.  "Dear me! dear me!" he was muttering.
    "I'm sartin they must be here.  I KNOW I put 'em here because . . .
    OW!"
</p>
<p>
    He was kneeling and holding the coat with one hand while he fumbled
    in the pockets with the other.  Unconsciously he had leaned
    backward until he sat upon his heels.  Now, with an odd expression
    of mingled pain and relief, he reached into the hip pocket of his
    trousers and produced a pair of spectacles.  He smiled his slow,
    fleeting smile.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he observed, "I found 'em my way&#8212;backwards.  Anybody else
    would have found 'em by looking for 'em; I lost 'em lookin' for 'em
    and found 'em by sittin' on 'em. . . .  Oh, here you are, Babbie!
    Sakes alive, you're sort of dampish."
</p>
<p>
    She was all of that.  She had come running in answer to his call
    and had the shingle boat hugged close to her.  The water from it
    had trickled down the front of her dress.  Her shoes and stockings
    were splashed with wet sand.
</p>
<p>
    "Is dinner ready, Uncle Jed?" she asked, eagerly.  Then becoming
    aware that the two strange gentlemen standing by the fire were
    really and truly "officer ones," she looked wide-eyed up at them
    and uttered an involuntary "Oh!"
</p>
<p>
    "Babbie," said Jed, "let me see that boat of yours a minute, will
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbie obediently handed it over.  Jed inspected it through his
    spectacles.  Then he pulled the paper sail from the sharpened
    stick&#8212;the mast&#8212;unfolded it, looked at it, and then extended it at
    arm's length toward Major Grover.
</p>
<p>
    "That's your plan thing, ain't it?" he asked, calmly.
</p>
<p>
    Both officers reached for the paper, but the younger, remembering
    in time, drew back.  The other took it, gave it a quick glance, and
    then turned again to Mr. Winslow.
</p>
<p>
    "Where did you get this?" he asked, crisply.
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "She gave it to me, this little girl here," he explained.  She
    wanted a sail for that shingle craft I whittled out for her.
    Course if I'd had on my specs I presume likely I'd have noticed
    that 'twas an out of the common sort of paper, but&#8212;I was wearin'
    'em in my pants pocket just then."
</p>
<p>
    "Where did you get it?" demanded Rayburn, addressing Barbara.  The
    child looked frightened.  Major Grover smiled reassuringly at her
    and she stammered a rather faint reply.
</p>
<p>
    "I found it blowing around up on the little hill there," she said,
    pointing.  "It was blowing real hard and I had to run to catch it
    before it got to the edge of the water.  I'm&#8212;I&#8212;I'm sorry I gave
    it to Uncle Jed for a sail.  I didn't know&#8212;and&#8212;and he didn't
    either," she added, loyally.
</p>
<p>
    "That's all right, my dear.  Of course you didn't know.  Well,
    Rayburn," turning to the lieutenant, "there's your plan.  You see
    it did blow away, after all.  I think you owe this young lady
    thanks that it is not out in mid-channel by this time.  Take it
    back to the office and see if the holes in it have spoiled its
    usefulness to any extent."
</p>
<p>
    The lieutenant, very red in the face, departed, bearing his
    precious plan.  Jed heaved a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he exclaimed, "now I presume likely I can attend to my
    chowder."
</p>
<p>
    "The important things of life, eh?" queried Major Grover.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  I don't know's there's anything much more important than
    eatin'.  It's a kind of expensive habit, but an awful hard one to
    swear off of. . . .  Hum. . . .  Speakin' of important things, was
    that plan of yours very important, Mr.&#8212;I mean Major?"
</p>
<p>
    "Rather&#8212;yes."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho! . . .  And I stuck it on a stick and set it afloat on a
    shingle.  I cal'late if Sam Hunniwell knew of that he'd say 'twas
    characteristic. . . .  Hum. . . .  Sho! . . .  I read once about a
    feller that found where the great seal of England was hid and he
    used it to crack nuts with.  I guess likely that feller must have
    been my great, great, great granddad."
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover looked surprised.
</p>
<p>
    "I've read that story," he said, "but I can't remember where."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was stirring his chowder.  "Eh?" he said, absently.  "Where?
    Oh, 'twas in&#8212;the&#8212;er&#8212;'Prince and the Pauper,' you know.  Mark
    Twain wrote it."
</p>
<p>
    "That's so; I remember now.  So you've read 'The Prince and the
    Pauper'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Read about everything Mark Twain ever wrote, I shouldn't
    wonder."
</p>
<p>
    "Do you read a good deal?"
</p>
<p>
    "Some. . . .  There!  Now we'll call that chowder done for the
    second time, I guess.  Set down and pass your plate, Babbie.
    You'll set down and have a bite with us, won't you, Mr.&#8212;Major&#8212;I
    snum I've forgot your name.  You mustn't mind; I forget my own
    sometimes."
</p>
<p>
    "Grover.  I am a major in the Engineers, stationed here for the
    present to look after this construction work.  No, thank you, I
    should like to stay, but I must go back to my office."
</p>
<p>
    "Dear, dear!  That's too bad.  Babbie and I would like first-rate
    to have you stay.  Wouldn't we, Babbie?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, sir," she said.  "And the chowder will be awf'ly good.  Uncle
    Jed's chowders always are."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure of it."  Major Grover's look of surprise was more evident
    than ever as he gazed first at Barbara and then at Mr. Winslow.
    His next question was addressed to the latter.
</p>
<p>
    "So you are this young lady's uncle?" he inquired.  It was Barbara
    who answered.
</p>
<p>
    "Not my really uncle," she announced.  "He's just my make-believe
    uncle.  He says he's my step-uncle 'cause he comes to our back
    steps so much.  But he's almost better than a real uncle," she
    declared, emphatically.
</p>
<p>
    The major laughed heartily and said he was sure of it.  He seemed
    to find the pair hugely entertaining.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, good-by," he said.  "I hope you and your uncle will visit us
    again soon.  And I hope next time no one will take him for a spy."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked mournfully at the fire.  "I've been took for a fool
    often enough," he observed, "but a spy is a consider'ble worse
    guess."
</p>
<p>
    Grover looked at him.  "I'm not so sure," he said.  "I imagine both
    guesses would be equally bad.  Well, good-by.  Don't forget to come
    again."
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you, thank you.  And when you're over to Orham drop in some
    day and see Babbie and me.  Anybody&#8212;the constable or anybody&#8212;will
    tell you where I live."
</p>
<p>
    Their visitor laughed, thanked him, and hurried away.  Said Barbara
    between spoonfuls:
</p>
<p>
    "He's a real nice officer one, isn't he, Uncle Jed?  Petunia and I
    like him."
</p>
<p>
    During the rest of the afternoon they walked along the beach,
    picked up shells, inspected "horse-foot" crabs, jelly fish and
    "sand collars," and enjoyed themselves so thoroughly that it was
    after four when they started for home.  The early October dusk
    settled down as they entered the winding channel between the sand
    islands and the stretches of beaches.  Barbara, wrapped in an old
    coat of Captain Perez's, which, smelling strongly of fish, had been
    found in a locker, seemed to be thinking very hard and, for a
    wonder, saying little.  At last she broke the silence.
</p>
<p>
    "That Mr. Major officer man was 'stonished when I called you 'Uncle
    Jed,'" she observed.  "Why, do you s'pose?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed whistled a few bars and peered over the side at the seaweed
    marking the border of the narrow, shallow channel.
</p>
<p>
    "I cal'late," he drawled, after a moment, "that he hadn't noticed
    how much we look alike."
</p>
<p>
    It was Barbara's turn to be astonished.
</p>
<p>
    "But we DON'T look alike, Uncle Jed," she declared.  "Not a single
    bit."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "No-o," he admitted.  "I presume that's why he didn't
    notice it."
</p>
<p>
    This explanation, which other people might have found somewhat
    unsatisfactory, appeared to satisfy Miss Armstrong; at any rate she
    accepted it without comment.  There was another pause in the
    conversation.  Then she said:
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know, after all, as I ought to call you 'Uncle Jed,' Uncle
    Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Why not, for the land sakes?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause uncles make people cry in our family.  I heard Mamma crying
    last night, after she thought I was asleep.  And I know she was
    crying about Uncle Charlie.  She cried when they took him away, you
    know, and now she cries when he's coming home again.  She cried
    awf'ly when they took him away."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, she did, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  He used to live with Mamma and me at our house in
    Middleford.  He's awful nice, Uncle Charlie is, and Petunia and I
    were very fond of him.  And then they took him away and we haven't
    seen him since."
</p>
<p>
    "He's been sick, maybe."
</p>
<p>
    "Perhaps so.  But he must be well again now cause he's coming home;
    Mamma said so."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Well, I guess that was it.  Probably he had to go to the&#8212;
    the hospital or somewhere and your ma has been worried about him.
    He's had an operation maybe.  Lots of folks have operations
    nowadays; it's got to be the fashion, seems so."
</p>
<p>
    The child reflected.
</p>
<p>
    "Do they have to have policemen come to take you to the hospital?"
    she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Policemen?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  'Twas two big policemen took Uncle Charlie away the first
    time.  We were having supper, Mamma and he and I, and Nora went to
    the door when the bell rang and the big policemen came and Uncle
    Charlie went away with them.  And Mamma cried so.  And she wouldn't
    tell me a bit about. . . .  Oh! OH!  I've told about the policemen!
    Mamma said I mustn't ever, EVER tell anybody that.  And&#8212;and I did!
    I DID!"
</p>
<p>
    Aghast at her own depravity, she began to sob.  Jed tried to
    comfort her and succeeded, after a fashion, at least she stopped
    crying, although she was silent most of the way home.  And Jed
    himself was silent also.  He shared her feeling of guilt.  He felt
    that he had been told something which neither he nor any outsider
    should have heard, and his sensitive spirit found little
    consolation in the fact that the hearing of it had come through no
    fault of his.  Besides, he was not so sure that he had been
    faultless.  He had permitted the child's disclosures to go on when,
    perhaps, he should have stopped them.  By the time the "Araminta's"
    nose slid up on the sloping beach at the foot of the bluff before
    the Winslow place she held two conscience-stricken culprits instead
    of one.
</p>
<p>
    And if Ruth Armstrong slept but little that night, as her daughter
    said had been the case the night before, she was not the only
    wakeful person in that part of Orham.  She would have been
    surprised if she had known that her eccentric neighbor and landlord
    was also lying awake and that his thoughts were of her and her
    trouble.  For Jed, although he had heard but the barest fragment of
    the story of "Uncle Charlie," a mere hint dropped from the lips of
    a child who did not understand the meaning of what she said, had
    heard enough to make plain to him that the secret which the young
    widow was hiding from the world was a secret involving sorrow and
    heartbreak for herself and shame and disgrace for others.  The
    details he did not know, nor did he wish to know them; he was
    entirely devoid of that sort of curiosity.  Possession of the
    little knowledge which had been given him, or, rather, had been
    thrust upon him, and which Gabe Bearse would have considered a
    gossip treasure trove, a promise of greater treasures to be
    diligently mined, to Jed was a miserable, culpable thing, like the
    custody of stolen property.  He felt wicked and mean, as if he had
    been caught peeping under a window shade.

<h2>
    CHAPTER X
</h2>
<p>
    That night came a sudden shift in the weather and when morning
    broke the sky was gray and overcast and the wind blew raw and
    penetrating from the northeast.  Jed, at work in his stock room
    sorting a variegated shipment of mills and vanes which were to go
    to a winter resort on the west coast of Florida, was, as he might
    have expressed it, down at the mouth.  He still felt the sense of
    guilt of the night before, but with it he felt a redoubled
    realization of his own incompetence.  When he had surmised his
    neighbor and tenant to be in trouble he had felt a strong desire to
    help her; now that surmise had changed to certainty his desire to
    help was stronger than ever.  He pitied her from the bottom of his
    heart; she seemed so alone in the world and so young.  She needed a
    sympathetic counselor and advisor.  But he could not advise or help
    because neither he nor any one else in Orham was supposed to know
    of her trouble and its nature.  Even if she knew that he knew,
    would she accept the counsel of Shavings Winslow?  Hardly!  No
    sensible person would.  How the townsfolk would laugh if they knew
    he had even so much as dreamed of offering it.
</p>
<p>
    He was too downcast even to sing one of his lugubrious hymns or to
    whistle.  Instead he looked at the letter pinned on a beam beside
    him and dragged from the various piles one half-dozen crow vanes,
    one half-dozen gull vanes, one dozen medium-sized mills, one dozen
    small mills, three sailors, etc., etc., as set forth upon that
    order.  One of the crows fell to the floor and he accidently
    stepped upon it and snapped its head off.  He was gazing solemnly
    down at the wreck when the door behind him opened and a strong
    blast of damp, cold wind blew in.  He turned and found that Mrs.
    Armstrong had opened the door.  She entered and closed it behind
    her.
</p>
<p>
    "Good morning," she said.
</p>
<p>
    Jed was surprised to see her at such an early hour; also just at
    that time her sudden appearance was like a sort of miracle, as if
    the thoughts in his brain had taken shape, had materialized.  For a
    moment he could not regain presence of mind sufficient to return
    her greeting.  Then, noticing the broken vane on the floor, she
    exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you have had an accident.  Isn't that too bad!  When did it
    happen?"
</p>
<p>
    He looked down at the decapitated crow and touched one of the
    pieces with the toe of his boot.
</p>
<p>
    "Just this minute," he answered.  "I stepped on it and away she
    went.  Did a pretty neat, clean job, didn't I? . . .  Um-hm. . . .
    I wonder if anybody stepped on MY head 'twould break like that.
    Probably not; the wood in it is too green, I cal'late."
</p>
<p>
    She smiled, but she made no comment on this characteristic bit of
    speculation.  Instead she asked: "Mr. Winslow, are you very busy
    this morning?  Is your work too important to spare me just a few
    minutes?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked surprised; he smiled his one-sided smile.
</p>
<p>
    "No, ma'am," he drawled.  "I've been pretty busy but 'twan't about
    anything important.  I presume likely," he added, "there ain't
    anybody in Ostable County that can be so busy as I can be doin'
    nothin' important."
</p>
<p>
    "And you can spare a few minutes?  I&#8212;I want to talk to you very
    much.  I won't be long, really."
</p>
<p>
    He regarded her intently.  Then he walked toward the door leading
    to the little workroom.  "Come right in here, ma'am," he said,
    gravely; adding, after they had entered the other apartment, "Take
    that chair.  I'll sit over here on the box."
</p>
<p>
    He pulled forward the box and turned to find her still standing.
</p>
<p>
    "Do sit down," he urged.  "That chair ain't very comfortable, I
    know.  Perhaps I'd better get you another one from my sittin'-room
    in yonder."
</p>
<p>
    He was on his way to carry out the suggestion, but she interrupted
    him.  "Oh, no," she said.  "This one will be perfectly comfortable,
    I'm sure, only&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?  Is there somethin' the matter with it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not the matter with it, exactly, but it seems to be&#8212;occupied."
</p>
<p>
    Jed stepped forward and peered over the workbench at the chair.
    Its seat was piled high with small pasteboard boxes containing
    hardware-screws, tacks and metal washers&#8212;which he used in his mill
    and vane-making.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he exclaimed.  "Hum!  Does seem to be taken, as you say.  I
    recollect now; a lot of that stuff came in by express day before
    yesterday afternoon and I piled it up there while I was unpackin'
    it.  Here!" apparently addressing the hardware, "you get out of
    that.  That seat's reserved."
</p>
<p>
    He stretched a long arm over the workbench, seized the chair by the
    back and tipped it forward.  The pasteboard boxes went to the floor
    in a clattering rush.  One containing washers broke open and the
    little metal rings rolled everywhere.  Mr. Winslow did not seem to
    mind.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he exclaimed, with evident satisfaction; "sit right down,
    ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    The lady sat as requested, her feet amid the hardware boxes and her
    hands upon the bench before her.  She was evidently very nervous,
    for her fingers gripped each other tightly.  And, when she next
    spoke, she did not look at her companion.
</p>
<p>
    "Mr. Winslow," she began, "I&#8212;I believe&#8212;that is, Babbie tells me
    that&#8212;that last evening, when you and she were on your way back
    here in the boat, she said something&#8212;she told you something
    concerning our&#8212;my&#8212;family affairs which&#8212;which&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She faltered, seeming to find it hard to continue.  Jed did not
    wait.  He was by this time at least as nervous as she was and
    considerably more distressed and embarrassed.  He rose from the box
    and extended a protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, ma'am," he begged.  "Now, Mrs. Armstrong, please&#8212;please
    don't say any more.  It ain't necessary, honest it ain't.  She&#8212;
    she&#8212;that child she didn't tell me much of anything anyhow, and she
    didn't mean to tell that.  And if you knew how ashamed and&#8212;and
    mean I've felt ever since to think I let myself hear that much!  I
    hope&#8212;I do hope you don't think I tried to get her to tell me
    anything.  I do hope you don't think that."
</p>
<p>
    His agitation was so acute and so obvious that she looked at him in
    wonder for a moment.  Then she hastened to reassure him.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't distress yourself, Mr. Winslow," she said, smiling sadly.
    "I haven't known you very long but I have already learned enough
    about you to know that you are an honorable man.  If I did not know
    that I shouldn't be here now.  It is true that I did not mean for
    you or any one here in Orham to learn of my&#8212;of our trouble, and if
    Babbie had not told you so much I probably should never have spoken
    to you about it.  The poor child's conscience troubled her so last
    evening that she came crying to me and confessed, and it is because
    I gathered from her that she had told enough to make you at least
    guess the truth that I am here now.  I prefer that you should hear
    the story just as it is from me, rather than imagine something
    which might be worse.  Don't you see?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed saw, but he was still very much perturbed.
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, Mrs. Armstrong," he begged, "don't tell me anything,
    please don't.  I laid awake about all night thinkin' what I'd ought
    to do, whether I'd ought to tell you what Babbie said, or just not
    trouble you at all and try to forget I ever heard it.  That's what
    I decided finally, to forget it; and I will&#8212;I vow and declare I
    will!  Don't you tell me anything, and let me forget this.  Now
    please."
</p>
<p>
    But she shook her head.  "Things like that are not so easily
    forgotten," she said; "even when one tries as hard to forget as I
    am sure you would, Mr. Winslow.  No, I want to tell you; I really
    do.  Please don't say any more.  Let me go on. . . .  Oh," with a
    sudden burst of feeling "can't you see that I must talk with
    SOMEONE&#8212;I MUST?"
</p>
<p>
    Her clasped fingers tightened and the tears sprang to her eyes.
    Poor Jed's distress was greater than ever.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Mrs. Armstrong," he stammered, "all I meant to say was
    that you mustn't feel you've got to tell me.  Course if you want
    to, that's different altogether.  What I'm tryin' to say," he
    added, with a desperate attempt to make his meaning perfectly
    clear, "is not to pay any attention to ME at all but do just what
    YOU want to, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    Even on the verge of tears as she was, she could not forbear
    smiling a little at this proclamation of complete self-effacement.
    "I fear I must pay some attention to you," she said, "if I am to
    confide in you and&#8212;and perhaps ask your help, your advice,
    afterwards.  I have reached a point when I must ask some one's
    advice; I have thought myself into a maze and I don't know what to
    do&#8212;I don't know WHAT to do.  I have no near relatives, no friends
    here in Orham&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed held up a protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Excuse me, Mrs. Armstrong," he stammered; "I don't know as you
    recollect, probably it might not have meant as much to you as it
    did to me; but a spell ago you said somethin' about countin' me as
    a friend."
</p>
<p>
    "I know I did.  And I meant it.  You have been very kind, and
    Barbara is so fond of you. . . .  Well, perhaps you can advise me,
    at least you can suggest&#8212;or&#8212;or&#8212;help me to think.  Will you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed passed his hand across his chin.  It was obvious that her
    asking his counsel was simply a last resort, a desperate, forlorn
    hope.  She had no real confidence in his ability to help.  He would
    have been the last to blame her for this; her estimate of his
    capabilities was like his own, that was all.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he observed, slowly, "as to givin' my advice, when a
    man's asked to give away somethin' that's worth nothin' the least
    he can do is say yes and try to look generous, I cal'late.  If I
    can advise you any, why, I'll feel proud, of course."
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you.  Mr. Winslow, for the past two years or more I have
    been in great trouble.  I have a brother&#8212;but you knew that; Babbie
    told you."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  The one she calls 'Uncle Charlie'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  He is&#8212;he is serving his sentence in the Connecticut State
    Prison."
</p>
<p>
    Jed leaned back upon the box.  His head struck smartly against the
    edge of the bandsaw bench, but he did not seem to be aware of the
    fact.
</p>
<p>
    "My Lord above!" he gasped.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it is true.  Surely you must have guessed something of that
    sort, after Babbie's story of the policemen."
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I&#8212;well, I did sort of&#8212;of presume likely he must have got into
    some sort of&#8212;of difficulty, but I never thought 'twas bad as
    that. . . .  Dear me! . . .  Dear me!"
</p>
<p>
    "My brother is younger than I; he is scarcely twenty-three years
    old.  He and I are orphans.  Our home was in Wisconsin.  Father was
    killed in a railway accident and Mother and my brother Charles and
    I were left with very little money.  We were in a university town
    and Mother took a few students as lodgers.  Doctor Armstrong was
    one; I met him there, and before he left the medical college we
    were engaged to be married.  Charlie was only a boy then, of
    course.  Mother died three years later.  Meanwhile Seymour&#8212;Doctor
    Armstrong&#8212;had located in Middleford, Connecticut, and was
    practicing medicine there.  He came on, we were married, and I
    returned to Middleford with him.  We had been married but a few
    years when he died&#8212;of pneumonia.  That was the year after Babbie
    was born.  Charles remained in Wisconsin, boarding with a cousin of
    Mother's, and, after he graduated from high school, entered one of
    the banks in the town.  He was very successful there and the bank
    people liked him.  After Seymour&#8212;my husband&#8212;died, he came East to
    see me at Middleford.  One of Doctor Armstrong's patients, a bond
    broker in New Haven, took a fancy to him, or we thought he did, and
    offered him a position.  He accepted, gave up his place at the bank
    in Wisconsin, and took charge of this man's Middleford office,
    making his home with Babbie and me.  He was young, too young I
    think now, to have such a responsible position, but every one said
    he had a remarkably keen business mind and that his future was
    certain to be brilliant.  And then&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She paused.  It was evident that the hard part of her story was
    coming.  After a moment she went on.
</p>
<p>
    "Charlie was popular with the young people there in Middleford.  He
    was always a favorite, at home, at school, everywhere.  Mother
    idolized him while she lived, so did I, so did Babbie.  He was fond
    of society and the set he was friendly with was made up, for the
    most part, of older men with much more money than he.  He was
    proud, he would not accept favors without repaying them, he liked a
    good time, perhaps he was a little fast; not dissipated&#8212;I should
    have known if he were that&#8212;but&#8212;careless&#8212;and what you men call a
    'good fellow.'  At any rate, he&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Again she paused.  Jed, sitting on the box, clasping his knee
    between his hands, waited anxiously for her to continue.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course you can guess what happened," she said, sadly, after a
    moment.  "It was the old story, that is all.  Charlie was living
    beyond his means, got into debt and speculated in stocks, hoping to
    make money enough to pay those debts.  The stocks went down and&#8212;
    and&#8212;well, he took money belonging to his employer to protect his
    purchases."
</p>
<p>
    She waited, perhaps expecting her companion to make some comment.
    He did not and again she spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "I know he meant only to borrow it," she declared.  "I KNOW it.  He
    isn't bad, Mr. Winslow; I know him better than any one and he ISN'T
    bad.  If he had only come to me when he got into the trouble!
    If he had only confided in me!  But he was proud and&#8212;and he
    didn't. . . .  Well, I won't tell you how his&#8212;his fault was
    discovered; it would take a long time and it isn't worth while.
    They arrested him, he was tried and&#8212;and sent to prison for two
    years."
</p>
<p>
    For the first time since she began her story Jed uttered a word.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he exclaimed.  "Sho, sho!  Dear me!  The poor young feller!"
</p>
<p>
    She looked up at him quickly.  "Thank you," she said, gratefully.
    "Yes, he was sent to prison.  He was calm and resigned and very
    brave about it, but to me it was a dreadful shock.  You see, he had
    taken so little money, not much over two thousand dollars.  We
    could have borrowed it, I'm sure; he and I could have worked out
    the debt together.  We could have done it; I would have worked at
    anything, no matter how hard, rather than have my brother branded
    all his life with the disgrace of having been in prison.  But the
    man for whom he had worked was furiously angry at what he called
    Charlie's ingratitude; he would teach the young thief a lesson, he
    said.  Our lawyer went to him; I went to him and begged him not to
    press the case.  Of course Charlie didn't know of my going; he
    never would have permitted it if he had.  But I went and begged and
    pleaded.  It did no good.  Why, even the judge at the trial, when
    he charged the jury, spoke of the defendant's youth and previous
    good character. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    She covered her eyes with her hand.  Poor Jed's face was a picture
    of distress.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Mrs. Armstrong," he urged, "don't, please don't.  I&#8212;I
    wouldn't tell me any more about it, if I was you.  Of course I'm&#8212;
    I'm proud to think you believed I was worth while tellin' it to and
    all that, but&#8212;you mustn't.  You'll make yourself sick, you know.
    Just don't tell any more, please."
</p>
<p>
    She took her hand away and looked at him bravely.
</p>
<p>
    "There isn't any more to tell," she said.  "I have told you this
    because I realized that Barbara had told you enough to make you
    imagine everything that was bad concerning my brother.  And he is
    not bad, Mr. Winslow.  He did a wrong thing, but I know&#8212;I KNOW he
    did not mean deliberately to steal.  If that man he worked for had
    been&#8212;if he had been&#8212;  But there, he was what he was.  He said
    thieves should be punished, and if they were punished when they
    were young, so much the better, because it might be a warning and
    keep them honest as they grew older.  He told me that, Mr. Winslow,
    when I pleaded with him not to make Charles' disgrace public and
    not to wreck the boy's life.  That was what he told me then.  And
    they say," she added, bitterly, "that he prides himself upon being
    a staunch supporter of the church."
</p>
<p>
    Jed let go of his knee with one hand in order to rub his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "I have queer notions, I cal'late," he drawled.  "If they wasn't
    queer they wouldn't be mine, I suppose.  If I was&#8212;er&#8212;as you might
    say, first mate of all creation I'd put some church folks in jail
    and a good many jail folks in church.  Seems's if the swap would be
    a help to both sides. . . .  I&#8212;I hope you don't think I'm&#8212;er&#8212;
    unfeelin', jokin', when you're in such worry and trouble," he
    added, anxiously.  "I didn't mean it."
</p>
<p>
    His anxiety was wasted.  She had heard neither his first remark nor
    the apology for it.  Her thoughts had been far from the windmill
    shop and its proprietor.  Now, apparently awakening to present
    realities, she rose and turned toward the door.
</p>
<p>
    "That was all," she said, wearily.  "You know the whole truth now,
    Mr. Winslow.  Of course you will not speak of it to any one else."
    Then, noticing the hurt look upon his face, she added, "Forgive me.
    I know you will not.  If I had not known it I should not have
    confided in you.  Thank you for listening so patiently."
</p>
<p>
    She was going, but he touched her arm.
</p>
<p>
    "Excuse me, Mrs. Armstrong," he faltered, "but&#8212;but wasn't there
    somethin' else?  Somethin' you wanted to ask my advice about&#8212;or&#8212;
    or&#8212;somethin'?"
</p>
<p>
    She smiled faintly.  "Yes, there was," she admitted.  "But I don't
    know that it is worth while troubling you, after all.  It is not
    likely that you can help me.  I don't see how any one can."
</p>
<p>
    "Probably you're right.  I&#8212;I ain't liable to be much help to
    anybody.  But I'm awful willin' to try.  And sometimes, you know&#8212;
    sometimes surprisin' things happen.  'Twas a&#8212;a mouse, or a ground
    mole, wasn't it, that helped the lion in the story book out of the
    scrape? . . .  Not that I don't look more like a&#8212;er&#8212;giraffe than
    I do like a mouse," he added.
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong turned and looked at him once more.  "You're very
    kind," she said.  "And I know you mean what you say. . . .  Why,
    yes, I'll tell you the rest.  Perhaps," with the slight smile, "you
    CAN advise me, Mr. Winslow.  You see&#8212;well, you see, my brother
    will be freed very shortly.  I have received word that he is to be
    pardoned, his sentence is to be shortened because of what they call
    his good conduct.  He will be free&#8212;and then?  What shall he do
    then?  What shall we all do?  That is my problem."
</p>
<p>
    She went on to explain.  This was the situation:  Her own income
    was barely sufficient for Barbara and herself to live, in the
    frugal way they were living, in a country town like Orham.  That
    was why she had decided to remain there.  No one in the village
    knew her story or the story of her brother's disgrace.  But now,
    almost any day, her brother might be discharged from prison.  He
    would be without employment and without a home.  She would so
    gladly offer him a home with her&#8212;they could manage to live, to
    exist in some way, she said&#8212;but she knew he would not be content
    to have her support him.  There was no chance of employment in
    Orham; he would therefore be forced to go elsewhere, to go
    wandering about looking for work.  And that she could not bear to
    think of.
</p>
<p>
    "You see," she said, "I&#8212;I feel as if I were the only helper and&#8212;
    well&#8212;guardian the poor boy has.  I can imagine," smiling wanly,
    "how he would scorn the idea of his needing a guardian, but I feel
    as if it were my duty to be with him, to stand by him when every
    one else has deserted him.  Besides," after an instant's
    hesitation, "I feel&#8212;I suppose it is unreasonable, but I feel as if
    I had neglected my duty before; as if perhaps I had not watched him
    as carefully as I should, or encouraged him to confide in me; I
    can't help feeling that perhaps if I had been more careful in this
    way the dreadful thing might not have happened. . . .  Oh," she
    added, turning away again, "I don't know why I am telling all these
    things to you, I'm sure.  They can't interest you much, and the
    telling isn't likely to profit either of us greatly.  But I am so
    alone, and I have brooded over my troubles so much.  As I said I
    have felt as if I must talk with some one.  But there&#8212;good
    morning, Mr. Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    "Just a minute, please, Mrs. Armstrong; just a minute.  Hasn't your
    brother got any friends in Middleford who could help him get some
    work&#8212;a job&#8212;you know what I mean?  Seems as if he must have, or
    you must have."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, we have, I suppose.  We had some good friends there, as well
    as others whom we thought were friends.  But&#8212;but I think we both
    had rather die than go back there; I am sure I should.  Think what
    it would mean to both of us."
</p>
<p>
    Jed understood.  She might have been surprised to realize how
    clearly he understood.  She was proud, and it was plain to see that
    she had been very proud of her brother.  And Middleford had been
    her home where she and her husband had spent their few precious
    years together, where her child was born, where, after her brother
    came, she had watched his rise to success and the apparent
    assurance of a brilliant future.  She had begun to be happy once
    more.  Then came the crash, and shame and disgrace instead of pride
    and confidence.  Jed's imagination, the imagination which was quite
    beyond the comprehension of those who called him the town crank,
    grasped it all&#8212;or, at least, all its essentials.  He nodded
    slowly.
</p>
<p>
    "I see," he said.  "Yes, yes, I see. . . .  Hum."
</p>
<p>
    "Of course, any one must see.  And to go away, to some city or town
    where we are not known&#8212;where could we go?  What should we live on?
    And yet we can't stay here; there is nothing for Charles to do."
</p>
<p>
    "Um. . . .  He was a&#8212;what did you say his trade was?"
</p>
<p>
    "He was a bond broker, a kind of banker."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  A kind of banker. . . .  Sho!  Did he work in a bank?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes, I told you he did, in Wisconsin, where he and I used to
    live."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . .  Pretty smart at it, too, seems to me you said he was?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, very capable indeed."
</p>
<p>
    "I want to know. . . .  Hum. . . .  Sho!"
</p>
<p>
    He muttered one or two more disjointed exclamations and then ceased
    to speak altogether, staring abstractedly at a crack in the floor.
    All at once he began to hum a hymn.  Mrs. Armstrong, whose nerves
    were close to the breaking point, lost patience.
</p>
<p>
    "Good morning, Mr. Winslow," she said, and opened the door to the
    outer shop.  This time Jed did not detain her.  Instead he stared
    dreamily at the floor, apparently quite unconscious of her or his
    surroundings.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he drawled.  "Oh, yes, good mornin',&#8212;good mornin'. . . .
    Hum. . . .
</p>
<pre>    'There is a fountain filled with blood
       Drawn from Emmanuel's veins,
     And sinners plunged de de de de
       De de di dew dum de.'"
</pre>
<p>
    His visitor closed the door.  Jed still sat there gazing at vacancy
    and droning, dolefully.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XI
</h2>
<p>
    For nearly an hour he sat there, scarcely changing his position,
    and only varying his musical program by whistling hymns instead of
    singing them.  Once, hearing a step in the yard, he looked through
    the window and saw Gabriel Bearse walking toward the gate from the
    direction of the shop door instead of in the opposite direction.
    Evidently he had at first intended to call and then had changed his
    mind.  Mr. Winslow was duly grateful to whoever or whatever had
    inspired the change.  He had no desire to receive a visit from
    "Gab" Bearse, at this time least of all.
</p>
<p>
    Later on he heard another step, and, again glancing through the
    window, saw Seth Wingate, the vegetable and fruit peddler, walking
    from the door to the gate, just as Mr. Bearse had done.  Apparently
    Seth had changed his mind also.  Jed thought this rather odd, but
    again he was grateful.  He was thinking hard and was quite willing
    not to be disturbed.
</p>
<p>
    But the disturbing came ten minutes after Mr. Wingate's departure
    and came in the nature of a very distinct disturbance.  There was a
    series of thunderous knocks on the front door, that door was thrown
    violently open, and, before the startled maker of mills could do
    much more than rise to his feet, the door to the workroom was
    pulled open also.  Captain Hunniwell's bulk filled the opening.
    Captain Sam was red-faced and seemed excited.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, by the gracious king," he roared, "you're here, anyhow!
    What else is the matter with you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, who, after recognizing his visitor, had seated himself once
    more, looked up and nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Sam," he observed.  "Say, I was just thinkin' about you.
    That's kind of funny, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Funny!  Just thinkin' about me!  Well, I've been thinkin' about

    you, I tell you that:  Have you been in this shop all the forenoon?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Why, yes. . . .  Sartin. . . .  I've been right here."
</p>
<p>
    "You HAVE?  Gracious king!  Then why in the Old Harry have you got
    that sign nailed on your front door out here tellin' all hands
    you're out for the day and for 'em to ask for you up at Abijah
    Thompson's?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked much surprised.  His hand moved slowly across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he drawled.  "Sho!  Has that sign been hangin' there all
    this forenoon?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't ask me.  I guess it has from what I've heard.  Anyhow it's
    there now.  And WHAT'S it there for?  That's what I want to know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's face was very solemn, but there was a faint twinkle in his
    eye.  "That explains about Seth Wingate," he mused.  "Yes, and Gab
    Bearse too. . . .  Hum. . . .  The Lord was better to me than I
    deserved.  They say He takes care of children and drunken men and&#8212;
    er&#8212;the critters that most folks think belong to my lodge. . . .
    Hum. . . .  To think I forgot to take that sign down!  Sho!"
</p>
<p>
    "Forgot to take it down!  What in everlastin' blazes did you ever
    put it up for?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed explained why the placard had been prepared and affixed to the
    door.  "I only meant it for yesterday, though," he added.  "I'd
    intended takin' it down this mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam put back his head and laughed until the shop echoed.
</p>
<p>
    "Ho, ho, ho!" he roared.  "And you mean to tell me that you put it
    up there because you was goin' cruisin' to the aviation camp and
    you didn't want callers disturbin' Mrs. Armstrong?"
</p>
<p>
    His friend nodded.  "Um-hm," he admitted.  "I sent 'em to 'Bije's
    because he was as far off as anybody I could think of.  Pretty good
    idea, wasn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    The captain grinned.  "Great!" he declared.  "Fine!  Wonderful!
    You wait till 'Bije comes to tell you how fine 'twas.  He's in bed,
    laid up with neuralgia, and Emma J., his wife, says that every hour
    or less yesterday there was somebody bangin' at their door asking
    about you.  Every time they banged she says that 'Bije, his nerves
    bein' on edge the way they are, would pretty nigh jump the quilts
    up to the ceilin' and himself along with 'em.  And his remarks got
    more lit up every jump.  About five o'clock when somebody came
    poundin' he let out a roar you could hear a mile.  'Tell 'em
    Shavin's Winslow's gone to the devil,' he bellowed, 'and that I say
    they can go there too.'  And then Emma J. opened the door and
    'twan't anybody askin' about you at all; 'twas the Baptist minister
    come callin'.  I was drivin' past there just now and Emma J. came
    out to tell me about it.  She wanted to know if you'd gone clear
    crazy instead of part way.  I told her I didn't know, but I'd make
    it my business to find out.  Tut, tut, tut!  You are a wonder,
    Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not dispute the truth of this statement.  He looked
    troubled, however.  "Sho!" he said; "I'm sorry if I plagued 'Bijah
    that way.  If I'd known he was sick I wouldn't have done it.  I
    never once thought so many folks as one every hour would want to
    see me this time of year.  Dear me!  I'm sorry about 'Bije.  Maybe
    I'd better go down and kind of explain it to him."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam chuckled.  "I wouldn't," he said.  "If I was you I'd
    explain over the long distance telephone.  But, anyhow, I wouldn't
    worry much.  I cal'late Emma J. exaggerated affairs some.
    Probably, if the truth was known, you'd find not more than four
    folks came there lookin' for you yesterday.  Don't worry, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not answer.  The word "worry" had reminded him of his other
    visitor that morning.  He looked so serious that his friend
    repeated his adjuration.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't worry, I tell you," he said, again.  "'Tisn't worth it."
</p>
<p>
    "All right, I won't. . . .  I won't. . . .  Sam, I was thinkin'
    about you afore you came in.  You remember I told you that?"
</p>
<p>
    "I remember.  What have you got on your mind?  Any more money
    kickin' around this glory-hole that you want me to put to your
    account?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, yes, I believe there is some somewheres.  Seems to
    me I put about a hundred and ten dollars, checks and bills and
    such, away day before yesterday for you to take when you came.
    Maybe I'll remember where I put it before you go.  But 'twan't
    about that I was thinkin'.  Sam, how is Barzilla Small's boy, Lute,
    gettin' along in Gus Howes' job at the bank?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam snorted disgust.
</p>
<p>
    "Gettin' along!" he repeated.  "He's gettin' along the way a squid
    swims, and that's backwards.  And, if you asked me, I'd say the
    longer he stayed the further back he'd get."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho! then he did turn out to be a leak instead of an able seaman,
    eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "A leak!  Gracious king!  He's like a torpedo blow-up under the
    engine-room.  The bank'll sink if he stays aboard another month, I
    do believe.  And yet," he added, with a shake of the head, "I don't
    see but he'll have to stay; there ain't another available candidate
    for the job in sight.  I 'phoned up to Boston and some of our
    friends are lookin' around up there, but so far they haven't had
    any success.  This war is makin' young men scarce, that is young
    men that are good for much.  Pretty soon it'll get so that a
    healthy young feller who ain't in uniform will feel about as much
    out of place as a hog in a synagogue.  Yes, sir!  Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    He laughed in huge enjoyment of his own joke.  Jed stared dreamily
    at the adjusting screw on the handsaw.  His hands clasped his knee,
    his foot was lifted from the floor and began to swing back and
    forth.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," queried his friend, "what have you got on your mind?  Out
    with it."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  On my mind?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  When I see you begin to shut yourself together in the middle
    like a jackknife and start swinging that number eleven of yours I
    know you're thinkin' hard about somethin' or other.  What is it
    this time?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . well . . . er . . . Sam, if you saw a chance to get a
    real smart young feller in Lute's place in the bank you'd take him,
    wouldn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Would I?  Would a cat eat lobster?  Only show him to me, that's
    all!"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm. . . .  Now of course you know I wouldn't do anything to
    hurt Lute.  Not for the world I wouldn't.  It's only if you ARE
    goin' to let him go&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "IF I am.  Either he'll have to let go or the bank will, one or
    t'other.  United we sink, divided one of us may float, that's the
    way I look at it.  Lute'll stay till we can locate somebody else to
    take his job, and no longer."
</p>
<p>
    "Ya-as. . . .  Um-hm. . . .  Well, I tell you, Sam:  Don't you get
    anybody else till you and I have another talk.  It may be possible
    that I could find you just the sort of young man you're lookin'
    for."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  YOU can find me one?  YOU can?  What are you givin' me, Jed?
    Who is the young man; you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed gravely shook his head.  "No-o," he drawled.  "I hate to
    disappoint you, Sam, but it ain't me.  It's another&#8212;er&#8212;smart,
    lively young feller.  He ain't quite so old as I am; there's a
    little matter of twenty odd years between us, I believe, but
    otherwise than that he's all right.  And he knows the bankin'
    trade, so I'm told."
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!  Who is he?  Where is he?"
</p>
<p>
    "That I can't tell you just yet.  But maybe I can by and by."
</p>
<p>
    "Tell me now."
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  No, I just heard about him and it was told to me in secret.
    All I can say is don't get anybody to fill Lute Small's place till
    you and I have another talk."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam stared keenly into his friend's face.  Jed bore the
    scrutiny calmly; in fact he didn't seem to be aware of it.  The
    captain gave it up.
</p>
<p>
    "All right," he said.  "No use tryin' to pump you, I know that.
    When you make up your mind to keep your mouth shut a feller
    couldn't open it with a cold chisel.  I presume likely you'll tell
    in your own good time.  Now if you'll scratch around and find those
    checks and things you want me to deposit for you I'll take 'em and
    be goin'.  I'm in a little bit of a hurry this mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    Jed "scratched around," finally locating the checks and bills in
    the coffee pot on the shelf in his little kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" he exclaimed, with satisfaction, "I knew I put 'em
    somewheres where they'd be safe and where I couldn't forget 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "Where you couldn't forget 'em!  Why, you did forget 'em, didn't
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes . . . I cal'late I did this mornin', but that's
    because I didn't make any coffee for breakfast.  If I'd made coffee
    same as I usually do I'd have found 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "Why didn't you make coffee this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's eye twinkled.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "to be honest with you, Sam, 'twas because
    I couldn't find the coffee pot.  After I took it down to put this
    money in it I put it back on a different shelf.  I just found it
    now by accident."
</p>
<p>
    As the captain was leaving Jed asked one more question.  "Sam," he
    asked, "about this bank job now?  If you had a chance to get a
    bright, smart young man with experience in bank work, you'd hire
    him, wouldn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell's answer was emphatic.
</p>
<p>
    "You bet I would!" he declared.  "If I liked his looks and his
    references were good I'd hire him in two minutes.  And salary, any
    reasonable salary, wouldn't part us, either. . . .  Eh?  What makes
    you look like that?"
</p>
<p>
    For Jed's expression had changed; his hand moved across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh&#8212;er&#8212;references?" he repeated.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, why, of course.  I'd want references from the folks he'd
    worked for, statin' that he was honest and capable and all that.
    With those I'd hire him in two minutes, as I said.  You fetch him
    along and see.  So long, Jed.  See you later."
</p>
<p>
    He hustled out, stopping to tear from the outer door the placard
    directing callers to call at Abijah Thompson's.  Jed returned to
    his box and sat down once more to ponder.  In his innocence it had
    not occurred to him that references would be required.
</p>
<p>
    That evening, about nine, he crossed the yard and knocked at the
    back door of the little house.  Mrs. Armstrong answered the knock;
    Barbara, of course, was in bed and asleep.  Ruth was surprised to
    see her landlord at that, for him, late hour.  Also, remembering
    the unceremonious way in which he had permitted her to depart at
    the end of their interview that forenoon, she was not as cordial as
    usual.  She had made him her confidant, why she scarcely knew;
    then, after expressing great interest and sympathy, he had suddenly
    seemed to lose interest in the whole matter.  She was acquainted
    with his eccentricities and fits of absent-mindedness, but
    nevertheless she had been hurt and offended.  She told herself that
    she should have expected nothing more from "Shavings" Winslow, the
    person about whom two-thirds of Orham joked and told stories, but
    the fact remained that she was disappointed.  And she was angry,
    not so much with him perhaps, as with herself.  WHY had she been so
    foolish as to tell any one of their humiliation?
</p>
<p>
    So when Jed appeared at the back door she received him rather
    coldly.  He was quite conscious of the change in temperature, but
    he made no comment and offered no explanation.  Instead he told his
    story, the story of his interview with Captain Hunniwell.  As he
    told it her face showed at first interest, then hope, and at the
    last radiant excitement.  She clasped her hands and leaned toward
    him, her eyes shining.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Mr. Winslow," she cried, breathlessly, "do you mean it?  Do
    you really believe Captain Hunniwell will give my brother a
    position in his bank?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded slowly.  "Yes," he said, "I think likely he might.
    Course 'twouldn't be any great of a place, not at first&#8212;nor ever,
    I cal'late, so far as that goes.  'Tain't a very big bank and wages
    ain't&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But she interrupted.  "But that doesn't make any difference," she
    cried.  "Don't you see it doesn't!  The salary and all that won't
    count&#8212;now.  It will be a start for Charles, an opportunity for him
    to feel that he is a man again, doing a man's work, an honest man's
    work.  And he will be here where I can be with him, where we can be
    together, where it won't be so hard for us to be poor and where
    there will be no one who knows us, who knows our story.  Oh, Mr.
    Winslow, is it really true?  If it is, how&#8212;how can we ever thank
    you?  How can I ever show you how grateful I feel?"
</p>
<p>
    Her cheeks were flushed, her lips parted and joy shone in her eager
    eyes.  Her voice broke a little as she uttered the words.  Jed
    looked at her and then quickly looked away.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I&#8212;don't talk so, Mrs. Armstrong," he pleaded, hastily.  "It&#8212;
    it ain't anything, it ain't really.  It just&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Not anything?  Not anything to find my brother the opportunity he
    and I have been praying for?  To give me the opportunity of having
    him with me?  Isn't that anything?  It is everything.  Oh, Mr.
    Winslow, if you can do this for us&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Shsh!  Sshh!  Now, Mrs. Armstrong, please.  You mustn't say I'm
    doin' it for you.  I'm the one that just happened to think of it,
    that's all.  You could have done it just as well, if you'd thought
    of it."
</p>
<p>
    "Perhaps," with a doubtful smile, "but I should never have thought
    of it.  You did because you were thinking for me&#8212;for my brother
    and me.  And&#8212;and I thought you didn't care."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Didn't care?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  When I left you at the shop this morning after our talk.
    You were so&#8212;so odd.  You didn't speak, or offer to advise me as I
    had asked you to; you didn't even say good-by.  You just sat there
    and let me go.  And I didn't understand and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed put up a hand.  His face was a picture of distress.
</p>
<p>
    "Dear, dear, dear!" he exclaimed.  "Did I do that?  I don't
    remember it, but of course I did if you say so.  Now what on earth
    possessed me to? . . .  Eh?" as the idea occurred to him.  "Tell
    me, was I singin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes, you were.  That is, you were&#8212;were&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Makin' a noise as if I'd swallowed a hymn book and one of the
    tunes was chokin' me to death?  Um-hm, that's the way I sing.  And
    I was singin' when you left me, eh?  That means I was thinkin'
    about somethin'.  I told Babbie once, and it's the truth, that
    thinkin' was a big job with me and when I did it I had to drop
    everything else, come up into the wind like a schooner, you know,
    and just lay to and think. . . .  Oh, I remember now!  You said
    somethin' about your brother's workin' in a bank and that set me
    thinkin' that Sam must be needin' somebody by this time in Lute
    Small's place."
</p>
<p>
    "You didn't know he needed any one?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o, not exactly; but I knew Lute, and that amounted to the same
    thing.  Mrs. Armstrong, I do hope you'll forgive me for&#8212;for
    singin' and&#8212;and all the rest of my foolish actions."
</p>
<p>
    "Forgive you!  Will you forgive me for misjudging you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Land sakes, don't talk that way.  But there's one thing I haven't
    said yet and you may not like it.  I guess you and your brother'll
    have to go to Sam and tell him the whole story."
</p>
<p>
    Her expression changed.  "The whole story?" she repeated.  "Why,
    what do you mean?  Tell him that Charles has been in&#8212;in prison?
    You don't mean THAT?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," gravely; "I'm afraid I do.  It looks to me as if it was
    the only way."
</p>
<p>
    "But we can't!  Oh, Mr. Winslow, we can't do that."
</p>
<p>
    "I know 'twill be awful hard for you.  But, when I talked to Sam
    about my havin' a possible candidate for the bank place, the very
    last thing he said was that he'd be glad to see him providin' his
    references was all right.  I give you my word I'd never thought of
    references, not till then."
</p>
<p>
    "But if we tell him&#8212;tell him everything, we shall only make
    matters worse, shan't we?  Of course he won't give him the position
    then."
</p>
<p>
    "There's a chance he won't, that's true.  But Sam Hunniwell's a
    fine feller, there ain't any better, and he likes you and&#8212;well, he
    and I have been cruisin' in company for a long spell.  Maybe he'll
    give your brother a chance to make good.  I hope he will."
</p>
<p>
    "You only hope?  I thought you said you believed."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I do, but of course it ain't sartin.  I wish 'twas."
</p>
<p>
    She was silent.  Jed, watching her, saw the last traces of
    happiness and elation fade from her face and disappointment and
    discouragement come back to take their places.  He pitied her, and
    he yearned to help her.  At last he could stand it no longer.
</p>
<p>
    "Now, Mrs. Armstrong," he pleaded, "of course&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She interrupted.
</p>
<p>
    "No," she said, as if coming to a final decision and speaking that
    decision aloud:  "No, I can't do it."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Can't do&#8212;what?"
</p>
<p>
    "I can't have Captain Hunniwell know of our trouble.  I came here
    to Orham, where no one knew me, to avoid that very thing.  At home
    there in Middleford I felt as if every person I met was staring at
    me and saying, 'Her brother is in prison.'  I was afraid to have
    Babbie play with the other children.  I was&#8212;but there, I won't
    talk about it.  I can't.  And I cannot have it begin again here.
    I'll go away first.  We will all go away, out West, anywhere&#8212;
    anywhere where we can be&#8212;clean&#8212;and like other people."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was conscious of a cold sensation, like the touch of an icicle,
    up and down his spine.  Going away!  She and Babbie going away!  In
    his mind's eye he saw a vision of the little house closed once more
    and shuttered tight as it used to be.  He gasped.
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, Mrs. Armstrong," he faltered.  "Don't talk about goin'
    away.  It&#8212;it isn't needful for you to do anything like that.  Of
    course it ain't.  You&#8212;you mustn't.  I&#8212;we can't spare you."
</p>
<p>
    She drew a long breath.  "I would go to the other end of the
    world," she said, "rather than tell Captain Hunniwell the truth
    about my brother.  I told you because Babbie had told you so much
    already. . . .  Oh," turning swiftly toward him, "YOU won't tell
    Captain Hunniwell, will you?"
</p>
<p>
    Before he could answer she stretched out her hand.  "Oh, please
    forgive me," she cried.  "I am not myself.  I am almost crazy, I
    think.  And when you first told me about the position in the bank I
    was so happy.  Oh, Mr. Winslow, isn't there SOME way by which
    Charles could have that chance?  Couldn't&#8212;couldn't he get it and&#8212;
    and work there for&#8212;for a year perhaps, until they all saw what a
    splendid fellow he was, and THEN tell them&#8212;if it seemed necessary?
    They would know him then, and like him; they couldn't help it,
    every one likes him."
</p>
<p>
    She brushed the tears from her eyes.  Poor Jed, miserable and most
    unreasonably conscience-stricken, writhed in his chair.  "I&#8212;I
    don't know," he faltered.  "I declare I don't see how.  Er&#8212;er&#8212;
    Out in that bank where he used to work, that Wisconsin bank, he&#8212;
    you said he did first-rate there?"
</p>
<p>
    She started.  "Yes, yes," she cried, eagerly.  "Oh, he was splendid
    there!  And the man who was the head of that bank when Charles was
    there is an old friend of ours, of the family; he has retired now
    but he would help us if he could, I know.  I believe . . . I wonder
    if . . . Mr. Winslow, I can't tell any one in Orham of our disgrace
    and I can't bear to give up that opportunity for my brother.  Will
    you leave it to me for a little while?  Will you let me think it
    over?"
</p>
<p>
    Of course Jed said he would and went back to his little room over
    the shop.  As he was leaving she put out her hand and said, with
    impulsive earnestness:
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you, Mr. Winslow.  Whatever comes of this, or if nothing
    comes of it, I can never thank you enough for your great kindness."
</p>
<p>
    Jed gingerly shook the extended hand and fled, his face scarlet.
</p>
<p>
    During the following week, although he saw his neighbors each day,
    and several times a day, Mrs. Armstrong did not mention her brother
    or the chance of his employment in the Orham bank.  Jed, very much
    surprised at her silence, was tempted to ask what her decision was,
    or even if she had arrived at one.  On one occasion he threw out a
    broad hint, but the hint was not taken, instead the lady changed
    the subject; in fact, it seemed to him that she made it a point of
    avoiding that subject and was anxious that he should avoid it,
    also.  He was sure she had not abandoned the idea which, at first,
    had so excited her interest and raised her hopes.  She seemed to
    him to be still under a strong nervous strain, to speak and act as
    if under repressed excitement; but she had asked him to leave the
    affair to her, to let her think it over, so of course he could do
    or say nothing until she had spoken.  But he wondered and
    speculated a good deal and was vaguely troubled.  When Captain Sam
    Hunniwell called he did not again refer to his possible candidate
    for the position now held by Luther Small.  And, singularly enough,
    the captain himself did not mention the subject.
</p>
<p>
    But one morning almost two weeks after Jed's discussion with the
    young widow she and Captain Hunniwell came into the windmill shop
    together.  Mrs. Armstrong's air of excitement was very much in
    evidence.  Her cheeks were red, her eyes sparkled, her manner
    animated.  Her landlord had never seen her look so young, or, for
    that matter, so happy.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam began the conversation.  He, too, seemed to be in high
    good humor.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Jedidah Wilfred Shavin's'," he observed, facetiously, "what
    do you suppose I've got up my sleeve this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed laid down the chisel he was sharpening.
</p>
<p>
    "Your arms, I presume likely," he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I've got my arms and there's a fist at the end of each one of
    'em.  Any more&#8212;er&#8212;flippity answers like that one and you're
    liable to think you're struck by lightnin'.  This lady and I have
    got news for you.  Do you know what 'tis?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at Mrs. Armstrong and then at the speaker.
</p>
<p>
    "No-o," he said, slowly.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, to begin with it's this:  Lute Small is leavin' the Orham
    National a week from next Saturday by a vote of eight to one.  The
    directors and the cashier and I are the eight and he's the one.
    Ho, ho!  And who do you suppose comes aboard on the next Monday
    mornin' to take over what Lute has left of the job?  Eh?  Who?
    Why, your own candidate, that's who."
</p>
<p>
    Jed started.  Again he looked at Mrs. Armstrong and, as if in
    answer to that look, she spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, Mr. Winslow," she said, quickly, "my brother is coming to
    Orham and Captain Hunniwell has given him the position.  It is
    really you to whom he owes it all.  You thought of it and spoke to
    the captain and to me."
</p>
<p>
    "But why in time," demanded Captain Sam, "didn't you tell me right
    out that 'twas Mrs. Armstrong's brother you had in mind?  Gracious
    king! if I'd known that I'd have had Lute out a fortni't sooner."
</p>
<p>
    Jed made no reply to this.  He was still staring at the lady.
</p>
<p>
    "But&#8212;but&#8212;" he faltered, "did you&#8212;have you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped in the middle of a word.  Ruth was standing behind the
    captain and he saw the frightened look in her eyes and the swift
    movement of her finger to her lips.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes," she said.  "I&#8212;I have.  I told Captain Hunniwell of
    Charlie's experience in the bank in Wisconsin.  He has written
    there and the answer is quite satisfactory, or so he seems to
    think."
</p>
<p>
    "Couldn't be better," declared Captain Sam.  "Here's the letter
    from the man that used to be the bank president out there.  Read
    it, Jed, if you want to."
</p>
<p>
    Jed took the letter and, with a hand which shook a little, adjusted
    his glasses and read.  It was merely a note, brief and to the
    point.  It stated simply that while Charles Phillips had been in
    the employ of their institution as messenger, bookkeeper and
    assistant teller, he had been found honest, competent, ambitious
    and thoroughly satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
    "And what more do I want than that?" demanded the captain.
    "Anybody who can climb up that way afore he's twenty-five will do
    well enough for yours truly.  Course he and I haven't met yet, but
    his sister and I've met, and I'm not worryin' but what I'll like
    the rest of the family.  Besides," he added, with a combination
    laugh and groan, "it's a case of desperation with us up at the
    bank.  We've got to have somebody to plug that leak you was talkin'
    about, Jed, and we've got to have 'em immediate, right off quick,
    at once, or a little sooner.  It's a providence, your brother is to
    us, Mrs. Armstrong," he declared; "a special providence and no
    mistake."
</p>
<p>
    He hurried off a moment later, affirming that he was late at the
    bank already.
</p>
<p>
    "Course the cashier's there and the rest of the help," he added,
    "but it takes all hands and the cat to keep Lute from puttin' the
    kindlin' in the safe and lightin' up the stove with ten dollar
    bills.  So long."
</p>
<p>
    After he had gone Jed turned to his remaining visitor.  His voice
    shook a little as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "You haven't told him!" he faltered, reproachfully.  "You&#8212;you
    haven't told him!"
</p>
<p>
    She shook her head.  "I couldn't&#8212;I couldn't," she declared.
    "DON'T look at me like that.  Please don't!  I know it is wrong.  I
    feel like a criminal; I feel wicked.  But," defiantly, "I should
    feel more wicked if I had told him and my brother had lost the only
    opportunity that might have come to him.  He WILL make good, Mr.
    Winslow.  I KNOW he will.  He will make them respect him and like
    him.  They can't help it.  See!" she cried, her excitement and
    agitation growing; "see how Mr. Reed, the bank president there at
    home, the one who wrote that letter, see what he did for Charles!
    He knows, too; he knows the whole story.  I&#8212;I wrote to him.  I
    wrote that very night when you told me, Mr. Winslow.  I explained
    everything, I begged him&#8212;he is an old, old friend of our family&#8212;
    to do this thing for our sakes.  You see, it wasn't asking him to
    lie, or to do anything wrong.  It was just that he tell of Charles
    and his ability and character as he knew them.  It wasn't wrong,
    was it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not answer.
</p>
<p>
    "If it was," she declared, "I can't help it.  I would do it again&#8212;
    for the same reason&#8212;to save him and his future, to save us all.  I
    can't help what you think of me.  It doesn't matter.  All that does
    matter is that you keep silent and let my brother have his chance."
</p>
<p>
    Jed, leaning forward in his chair by the workbench, put his hand to
    his forehead.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't&#8212;don't talk so, Mrs. Armstrong," he begged.  "You know&#8212;you
    know I don't think anything you've done is wrong.  I ain't got the
    right to think any such thing as that.  And as for keepin' still&#8212;
    why, I&#8212;I did hope you wouldn't feel 'twas necessary to ask that."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't&#8212;I don't.  I know you and I trust you.  You are the only
    person in Orham whom I have trusted.  You know that."
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes&#8212;why, yes, I do know it and&#8212;and I'm ever so much obliged
    to you.  More obliged than I can tell you, I am.  Now&#8212;now would
    you mind tellin' me just one thing more?  About this Mr. What's-
    his-name out West in the bank there&#8212;this Mr. Reed&#8212;did he write
    you he thought 'twas all right for him to send Sam the&#8212;the kind of
    letter he did send him, the one givin' your brother such a good
    reference?"
</p>
<p>
    The color rose in her face and she hesitated before replying.
</p>
<p>
    "No," she confessed, after a moment.  "He did not write me that he
    thought it right to give Captain Hunniwell such a reference.  In
    fact he wrote that he thought it all wrong, deceitful, bordering on
    the dishonest.  He much preferred having Charles go to the captain
    and tell the whole truth.  On the other hand, however, he said he
    realized that that might mean the end of the opportunity here and
    perhaps public scandal and gossip by which we all might suffer.
    And he said he had absolute confidence that Charles was not a
    criminal by intent, and he felt quite sure that he would never go
    wrong again.  If he were still in active business, he said, he
    should not hesitate to employ him.  Therefore, although he still
    believed the other course safer and better, he would, if Captain
    Hunniwell wrote, answer as I had asked.  And he did answer in that
    way.  So, you see," she cried, eagerly, "HE believes in Charles,
    just as I do.  And just as you will when you know, Mr. Winslow.
    Oh, WON'T you try to believe now?"
</p>
<p>
    A harder-hearted man than Jed Winslow would have found it difficult
    to refuse such a plea made in such a way by such a woman.  And
    Jed's heart was anything but hard.
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, Mrs. Armstrong," he stammered, "you don't have to ask me
    that.  Course I believe in the poor young chap.  And&#8212;and I guess
    likely everything's goin' to come out all right.  That Mr. What's-
    his-name&#8212;er&#8212;Wright&#8212;no, Reed&#8212;I got read and write mixed up, I
    guess&#8212;he's a business man and he'd ought to know about such things
    better'n I do.  I don't doubt it'll come out fine and we won't
    worry any more about it."
</p>
<p>
    "And we will still be friends?  You know, Mr. Winslow, you are the
    only real friend I have in Orham.  And you have been so loyal."
</p>
<p>
    Jed flushed with pleasure.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I told you once," he said, "that my friends generally called me
    'Jed.'"
</p>
<p>
    She laughed.  "Very well, I'll call you 'Jed,'" she said.  "But turn
    about is fair play and you must call me 'Ruth.'  Will you?  Oh,
    there's Babbie calling me.  Thank you again, for Charles' sake and
    my own.  Good morning&#8212;Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;er&#8212;good mornin', Mrs. Armstrong."
</p>
<p>
    "What?"
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;I mean Mrs. Ruth."
</p>
<p>
    The most of that forenoon, that is the hour or so remaining, was
    spent by Mr. Winslow in sitting by the workbench and idly
    scratching upon a board with the point of the chisel.  Sometimes
    his scratches were meaningless, sometimes they spelled a name, a
    name which he seemed to enjoy spelling.  But at intervals during
    that day, and on other days which followed, he was conscious of an
    uneasy feeling, a feeling almost of guilt coupled with a dim
    foreboding.
</p>
<p>
    Ruth Armstrong had called him a friend and loyal.  But had he been
    as loyal to an older friend, a friend he had known all his life?
    Had he been loyal to Captain Sam Hunniwell?
</p>
<p>
    That was the feeling of guilt.  The foreboding was not as definite,
    but it was always with him; he could not shake it off.  All his
    life he had dealt truthfully with the world, had not lied, or
    evaded, or compromised.  Now he had permitted himself to become a
    silent partner in such a compromise.  And some day, somehow,
    trouble was coming because of it.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XII
</h2>
<p>
    Before the end of another week Charles Phillips came to Orham.  It
    was Ruth who told Jed the news.  She came into the windmill shop
    and, standing beside the bench where he was at work, she said: "Mr.
    Winslow, I have something to tell you."
</p>
<p>
    Jed put down the pencil and sheet of paper upon which he had been
    drawing new patterns for the "gull vane" which was to move its
    wings when the wind blew.  This great invention had not progressed
    very far toward practical perfection.  Its inventor had been busy
    with other things and had of late rather lost interest in it.  But
    Barbara's interest had not flagged and to please her Jed had
    promised to think a little more about it during the next day or so.
</p>
<p>
    "But can't you make it flap its wings, Uncle Jed?" the child had
    asked.
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "I don't know.  I
    thought I could, but now I ain't so sure.  I could make 'em whirl
    'round and 'round like a mill or a set of sailor paddles, but to
    make 'em flap is different.  They've got to be put on strong enough
    so they won't flop off.  You see," he added, solemnly, "if they
    kept floppin' off they wouldn't keep flappin' on.  There's all the
    difference in the world between a flap and flop."
</p>
<p>
    He was trying to reconcile that difference when Ruth entered the
    shop.  He looked up at her absently.  "Mr. Winslow," she began
    again, "I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    His reproachful look made her pause and smile slightly in spite of
    herself.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sorry," she said.  "Well, then&#8212;Jed&#8212;I have something to tell
    you.  My brother will be here to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed had been expecting to hear this very thing almost any day, but
    he was a little startled nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he exclaimed.  "You don't tell me!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  He is coming on the evening train to-morrow.  I had word
    from him this morning."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's hand moved to his chin.  "Hum . . ." he mused.  "I guess
    likely you'll be pretty glad to see him."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall be at least that," with a little break in her voice.  "You
    can imagine what his coming will mean to me.  No, I suppose you
    can't imagine it; no one can."
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not say whether he imagined it or not.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I'm real glad for you, Mrs. Ruth," he declared.  "Mrs. Ruth"
    was as near as he ever came to fulfilling their agreement
    concerning names.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure you are.  And for my brother's sake and my own I am very
    grateful to you.  Mr. Winslow&#8212;Jed, I mean&#8212;you have done so much
    for us already; will you do one thing more?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's answer was given with no trace of his customary hesitation.
    "Yes," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "This is really for me, perhaps, more than for Charles&#8212;or at least
    as much."
</p>
<p>
    Again there was no hesitation in the Winslow reply.
</p>
<p>
    "That won't make it any harder," he observed, gravely.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you.  It is just this: I have decided not to tell my brother
    that I have told you of his&#8212;his trouble, of his having been&#8212;where
    he has been, or anything about it.  He knows I have not told
    Captain Hunniwell; I'm sure he will take it for granted that I have
    told no one.  I think it will be so much easier for the poor boy if
    he can come here to Orham and think that no one knows.  And no one
    does know but you.  You understand, don't you?" she added, earnestly.
</p>
<p>
    He looked a little troubled, but he nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said, slowly.  "I understand, I cal'late."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure you do.  Of course, if he should ask me point-blank if I
    had told any one, I should answer truthfully, tell him that I had
    told you and explain why I did it.  And some day I shall tell him
    whether he asks or not.  But when he first comes here I want him to
    be&#8212;to be&#8212;well, as nearly happy as is possible under the
    circumstances.  I want him to meet the people here without the
    feeling that they know he has been&#8212;a convict, any of them.  And
    so, unless he asks, I shall not tell him that even you know; and I
    am sure you will understand and not&#8212;not&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Not say anything when he's around that might let the cat out of
    the bag.  Yes, yes, I see.  Well, I'll be careful; you can count on
    me, Mrs. Ruth."
</p>
<p>
    She looked down into his homely, earnest face.  "I do," she said,
    simply, and went out of the room.  For several minutes after she
    had gone Jed sat there gazing after her.  Then he sighed, picked up
    his pencil and turned again to the drawing of the gull.
</p>
<p>
    And the following evening young Phillips came.  Jed, looking from
    his shop window, saw the depot-wagon draw up at the gate.  Barbara
    was the first to alight.  Philander Hardy came around to the back
    of the vehicle and would have assisted her, but she jumped down
    without his assistance.  Then came Ruth and, after her, a slim
    young fellow carrying a traveling bag.  It was dusk and Jed could
    not see his face plainly, but he fancied that he noticed a
    resemblance to his sister in the way he walked and the carriage of
    his head.  The two went into the little house together and Jed
    returned to his lonely supper.  He was a trifle blue that evening,
    although he probably would not have confessed it.  Least of all
    would he have confessed the reason, which was that he was just a
    little jealous.  He did not grudge his tenant her happiness in her
    brother's return, but he could not help feeling that from that time
    on she would not be as intimate and confidential with him, Jed
    Winslow, as she had been.  After this it would be to this brother
    of hers that she would turn for help and advice.  Well, of course,
    that was what she should do, what any one of sense would do, but
    Jed was uncomfortable all the same.  Also, because he was himself,
    he felt a sense of guilty remorse at being uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
    The next morning he was presented to the new arrival.  It was
    Barbara who made the presentation.  She came skipping into the
    windmill shop leading the young man by the hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Uncle Jed," she said, "this is my Uncle Charlie.  He's been away
    and he's come back and he's going to work here always and live in
    the bank.  No, I mean he's going to work in the bank always and
    live&#8212;  No, I don't, but you know what I do mean, don't you, Uncle
    Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles Phillips smiled.  "If he does he must be a mind-reader,
    Babbie," he said.  Then, extending his hand, he added: "Glad to
    know you, Mr. Winslow.  I've heard a lot about you from Babbie and
    Sis."
</p>
<p>
    Jed might have replied that he had heard a lot about him also, but
    he did not.  Instead he said "How d'ye do," shook the proffered
    hand, and looked the speaker over.  What he saw impressed him
    favorably.  Phillips was a good-looking young fellow, with a
    pleasant smile, a taking manner and a pair of dark eyes which
    reminded Mr. Winslow of his sister's.  It was easy to believe
    Ruth's statement that he had been a popular favorite among their
    acquaintances in Middleford; he was the sort the average person
    would like at once, the sort which men become interested in and
    women spoil.
</p>
<p>
    He was rather quiet during this first call.  Babbie did two-thirds
    of the talking.  She felt it her duty as an older inhabitant to
    display "Uncle Jed" and his creations for her relative's benefit.
    Vanes, sailors, ships and mills were pointed out and commented
    upon.
</p>
<p>
    "He makes every one, Uncle Charlie," she declared solemnly.  "He's
    made every one that's here and&#8212;oh, lots and lots more.  He made
    the big mill that's up in our garret&#8212;  You haven't seen it yet,
    Uncle Charlie; it's going to be out on our lawn next spring&#8212;and he
    gave it to me for a&#8212;for a&#8212;  What kind of a present was that mill
    you gave me, Uncle Jed, that time when Mamma and Petunia and I were
    going back to Mrs. Smalley's because we thought you didn't want us
    to have the house any longer?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he queried.  "What kind of a present?  I don't know's I
    understand what you mean."
</p>
<p>
    "I mean what kind of a present was it.  It wasn't a Christmas
    present or a birthday present or anything like that, but it must be
    SOME kind of one.  What kind of present would you call it, Uncle
    Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "I guess likely you might call it a forget-
    me-not present, if you had to call it anything."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara pondered.
</p>
<p>
    "A&#8212;a forget-me-not is a kind of flower, isn't it?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm."
</p>
<p>
    "But this is a windmill.  How can you make a flower out of a
    windmill, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Well, that's a question," he admitted.  "But
    you can make flour IN a windmill, 'cause I've seen it done."
</p>
<p>
    More pondering on the young lady's part.  Then she gave it up.
</p>
<p>
    "You mustn't mind if you don't understand him, Uncle Charlie," she
    said, in her most confidential and grown-up manner.  "He says lots
    of things Petunia and I don't understand at all, but he's awful
    nice, just the same.  Mamma says he's choking&#8212;no, I mean joking
    when he talks that way and that we'll understand the jokes lots
    better when we're older.  SHE understands them almost always," she
    added proudly.
</p>
<p>
    Phillips laughed.  Jed's slow smile appeared and vanished.  "Looks
    as if facin' my jokes was no child's play, don't it," he observed.
    "Well, I will give in that gettin' any fun out of 'em is a man's
    size job."
</p>
<p>
    On the following Monday the young man took up his duties in the
    bank.  Captain Hunniwell interviewed him, liked him, and hired him
    all in the same forenoon.  By the end of the first week of their
    association as employer and employee the captain liked him still
    better.  He dropped in at the windmill shop to crow over the fact.
</p>
<p>
    "He takes hold same as an old-time first mate used to take hold of
    a green crew," he declared.  "He had his job jumpin' to the whistle
    before the second day was over.  I declare I hardly dast to wake up
    mornin's for fear I'll find out our havin' such a smart feller is
    only a dream and that the livin' calamity is Lute Small.  And to
    think," he added, "that you knew about him for the land knows how
    long and would only hint instead of tellin'.  I don't know as you'd
    have told yet if his sister hadn't told first.  Eh?  Would you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed deliberately picked a loose bristle from his paint brush.
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe not," he admitted.
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!  Well, WHY not?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't know.  I'm kind of&#8212;er&#8212;funny that way.  Like to take
    my own time, I guess likely.  Maybe you've noticed it, Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  MAYBE I've noticed it?  A blind cripple that was born deef
    and dumb would have noticed that the first time he ran across you.
    What on earth are you doin' to that paint brush; tryin' to
    mesmerize it?"
</p>
<p>
    His friend, who had been staring mournfully at the brush, now laid
    it down.
</p>
<p>
    "I was tryin' to decide," he drawled, "whether it needed hair tonic
    or a wig.  So you like this Charlie Phillips, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin sure I do!  And the customers like him, too.  Why, old
    Melissa Busteed was in yesterday and he waited on her for half an
    hour, seemed so, and when the agony was over neither one of 'em had
    got mad enough so anybody outside the buildin' would notice it.
    And that's a miracle that ain't happened in that bank for more'n
    ONE year.  Why, I understand Melissa went down street tellin' all
    hands what a fine young man we'd got workin' for us. . . .  Here,
    what are you laughin' at?"
</p>
<p>
    The word was ill-chosen; Jed seldom laughed, but he had smiled
    slightly and the captain noticed it.
</p>
<p>
    "What are you grinnin' at?" he repeated.
</p>
<p>
    Jed's hand moved across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Gab Bearse was in a spell ago," he replied, "and he was tellin'
    about what Melissa said."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, she said what I just said she said, didn't she?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow nodded.  "Um-hm," he admitted, "she said&#8212;er&#8212;all of
    that."
</p>
<p>
    "All of it?  Was there some more?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cordin' to Gabe there was.  'Cordin' to him she said . . . she
    said . . . er . . .  Hum! this brush ain't much better'n the other.
    Seem to be comin' down with the mange, both of 'em."
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!  Consarn the paint brushes!  Tell me what Melissa
    said."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes, yes. . . .  Well, 'cordin' to Gabe she said 'twas a
    comfort to know there was a place in this town where an unprotected
    female could go and not be insulted."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam's laugh could have been heard across the road.
</p>
<p>
    "Ho, ho!" he roared.  "An unprotected female, eh?  'Cordin' to my
    notion it's the male that needs protection when Melissa's around.
    I've seen Lute Small standin' in the teller's cage, tongue-tied and
    with the sweat standin' on his forehead, while Melissa gave him her
    candid opinion of anybody that would vote to allow alcohol to be
    sold by doctors in this town.  And 'twas ten minutes of twelve
    Saturday mornin', too, and there was eight men waitin' their turn
    in line, and nary one of them or Lute either had the spunk to ask
    Melissa to hurry.  Ho, ho! 'unprotected female' is good!"
</p>
<p>
    He had his laugh out and then added: "But there's no doubt that
    Charlie's goin' to be popular with the women.  Why, even Maud seems
    to take a shine to him.  Said she was surprised to have me show
    such good judgment.  Course she didn't really mean she was
    surprised," he hastened to explain, evidently fearing that even an
    old friend like Jed might think he was criticizing his idolized
    daughter.  "She was just teasin' her old dad, that's all.  But I
    could see that Charlie kind of pleased her.  Well, he pleases me
    and he pleases the cashier and the directors.  We agree, all of us,
    that we're mighty lucky.  I gave you some of the credit for gettin'
    him for us, Jed," he added magnanimously.  "You don't really
    deserve much, because you hung back so and wouldn't tell his name,
    but I gave it to you just the same.  What's a little credit between
    friends, eh?  That's what Bluey Batcheldor said the other day when
    he came in and wanted to borrow a hundred dollars on his personal
    note.  Ho! ho!"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam's glowing opinion of his paragon was soon echoed by the
    majority of Orham's population.  Charlie Phillips, although quiet
    and inclined to keep to himself, was liked by almost every one.  In
    the bank and out of it he was polite, considerate and always
    agreeable.  During these first days Jed fancied that he detected in
    the young man a certain alert dread, a sense of being on guard, a
    reserve in the presence of strangers, but he was not sure that this
    was anything more than fancy, a fancy inspired by the fact that he
    knew the boy's secret and was on the lookout for something of the
    sort.  At all events no one else appeared to notice it and it
    became more and more evident that Charlie, as nine-tenths of Orham
    called him within a fortnight, was destined to be the favorite here
    that, according to his sister, he had been everywhere else.
</p>
<p>
    Of course there were a few who did not, or would not, like him.
    Luther Small, the deposed bank clerk, was bitter in his sneers and
    caustic in his comments.  However, as Lute loudly declared that he
    was just going to quit anyhow, that he wouldn't have worked for old
    Hunniwell another week if he was paid a million a minute for it,
    his hatred of his successor seemed rather unaccountable.  Barzilla
    Small, Luther's fond parent, also professed intense dislike for the
    man now filling his son's position in the bank.  "I don't know how
    'tis," affirmed Barzilla, "but the fust time I see that young
    upstart I says to myself: 'Young feller, you ain't my kind.'  This
    remark being repeated to Captain Sam, the latter observed: 'That's
    gospel truth and thank the Lord for it.'"
</p>
<p>
    Another person who refused to accept Phillips favorably was Phineas
    Babbitt.  Phineas's bitterness was not the sort to sweeten over
    night.  He disliked the new bank clerk and he told Jed Winslow why.
    They met at the post office&#8212;Phineas had not visited the windmill
    shop since the day when he received the telegram notifying him of
    his son's enlistment&#8212;and some one of the group waiting for the
    mail had happened to speak of Charlie Phillips.  "He's a nice
    obligin' young chap," said the speaker, Captain Jeremiah Burgess.
    "I like him fust-rate; everybody does, I guess."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Babbitt, standing apart from the group, his bristling chin
    beard moving as he chewed his eleven o'clock allowance of "Sailor's
    Sweetheart," turned and snarled over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't," he snapped.
</p>
<p>
    His tone was so sharp and his utterance so unexpected that Captain
    Jerry jumped.
</p>
<p>
    "Land of Goshen!  You bark like a dog with a sore throat," he
    exclaimed.  "Why don't you like him?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause I don't, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    "That ain't much of a reason, seems to me.  What have you got
    against him, Phin?  You don't know anything to his discredit, do
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Never you mind whether I do or not."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Jerry grunted but seemed disinclined to press the point
    further.  Every one was surprised therefore when Jed Winslow moved
    across to where Phineas was standing, and looking mildly down at
    the little man, asked: "Do you know anything against him, Phin?"
</p>
<p>
    "None of your business.  What are you buttin' in for, Shavin's?"
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't.  I just asked you, that's all.  DO you know anything
    against Charlie Phillips?"
</p>
<p>
    "None of your business, I tell you."
</p>
<p>
    "I know it ain't.  But do you, Phin?"
</p>
<p>
    Each repetition of the question had been made in the same mild,
    monotonous drawl.  Captain Jerry and the other loungers burst into
    a laugh.  Mr. Babbitt's always simmering temper boiled over.
</p>
<p>
    "No, I don't," he shouted.  "But I don't know anything in his
    favor, neither.  He's a pet of Sam Hunniwell and that's enough for
    me.  Sam Hunniwell and every one of his chums can go to the devil.
    Every one of 'em; do you understand that, Jed Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  The solemn expression of his face did not
    change an atom.  "Thank you, Phin," he drawled.  "When I'm ready to
    start I'll get you to give me a letter of introduction."
</p>
<p>
    Jed had been fearful that her brother's coming might lessen the
    intimate quality of Ruth Armstrong's friendship with and dependence
    upon him.  He soon discovered, to his delight, that these fears
    were groundless.  He found that the very fact that Ruth had made
    him her sole confidant provided a common bond which brought them
    closer together.  Ruth's pride in her brother's success at the bank
    and in the encomiums of the townsfolk had to find expression
    somewhere.  She could express them to her landlord and she did.
    Almost every day she dropped in at the windmill shop for a moment's
    call and chat, the subject of that chat always, of course, the
    same.
</p>
<p>
    "I told you he would succeed," she declared, her eyes shining and
    her face alight.  "I told you so, Jed.  And he has.  Mr. Barber,
    the cashier, told me yesterday that Charles was the best man they
    had had in the bank for years.  And every time I meet Captain
    Hunniwell he stops to shake hands and congratulates me on having
    such a brother.  And they like him, not only because he is
    successful in the bank, but for himself; so many people have told
    me so.  Why, for the first time since we came to Orham I begin to
    feel as if I were becoming acquainted, making friends."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "He's a nice young chap," he said, quietly.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course he is. . . .  You mustn't mind my shameless family
    boasting," she added, with a little laugh.  "It is only because I
    am so proud of him, and so glad&#8212;so glad for us all."
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not mind.  It is doubtful if at that moment he was aware of
    what she was saying.  He was thinking how her brother's coming had
    improved her, how well she was looking, how much more color there
    was in her cheeks, and how good it was to hear her laugh once more.
    The windmill shop was a different place when she came.  It was a
    lucky day for him when the Powlesses frightened him into letting
    Barbara and her mother move into the old house for a month's trial.
</p>
<p>
    Of course he did not express these thoughts aloud, in fact he
    expressed nothing whatever.  He thought and thought and, after a
    time, gradually became aware that there was absolute silence in the
    shop.  He looked at his caller and found that she was regarding him
    intently, a twinkle in her eye and an amused expression about her
    mouth.  He started and awoke from his day-dream.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he exclaimed.  "Yes&#8212;yes, I guess so."
</p>
<p>
    She shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "You do?" she said.  "Why, I thought your opinion was exactly the
    opposite."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, yes, so 'tis, so 'tis."
</p>
<p>
    "Of course.  And just what did you say about it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was confused.  He swallowed hard, hesitated, swallowed again
    and stammered: "I&#8212;  Why, I&#8212;that is&#8212;you see&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She laughed merrily.  "You are a very poor pretender, Jed," she
    declared.  "Confess, you haven't the least idea what opinion I
    mean."
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;well, to be right down honest, I&#8212;I don't know's I have,
    Mrs. Ruth."
</p>
<p>
    "Of course, you haven't.  There isn't any opinion.  You have been
    sitting there for the last five minutes, staring straight at me and
    picking that paint brush to pieces.  I doubt if you even knew I was
    here."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, yes, I know that, I know that all right.  Tut! tut!"
    inspecting the damaged brush.  "That's a nice mess, ain't it?  Now
    what do you suppose I did that for?  I'm scared to death, when I
    have one of those go-to-sleeptic fits, that I'll pick my head to
    pieces.  Not that that would be as big a loss as a good paint
    brush," he added, reflectively.
</p>
<p>
    His visitor smiled.  "I think it would," she said.  "Neither Babbie
    nor I could afford to lose that head; it and its owner have been
    too thoughtful and kind.  But tell me, what WERE you thinking about
    just then?"
</p>
<p>
    The question appeared to embarrass Mr. Winslow a good deal.  He
    colored, fidgeted and stammered.  "Nothin', nothin' of any
    account," he faltered.  "My&#8212;er&#8212;my brain was takin' a walk around
    my attic, I cal'late.  There's plenty of room up there for a
    tramp."
</p>
<p>
    "No, tell me; I want to know."  Her expression changed and she
    added: "You weren't thinking of&#8212;of Charles'&#8212;his trouble at
    Middleford?  You don't still think me wrong in not telling Captain
    Hunniwell?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, no, no.  I wasn't thinkin' that at all."
</p>
<p>
    "But you don't answer my question.  Well, never mind.  I am really
    almost happy for the first time in ever so long and I mean to
    remain so if I can.  I am glad I did not tell&#8212;glad.  And you must
    agree with me, Mr. Winslow&#8212;Jed, I mean&#8212;or I shall not run in so
    often to talk in this confidential way."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Not run in?  Godfreys, Mrs. Ruth, don't talk so!  Excuse my
    strong language, but you scared me, talkin' about not runnin' in."
</p>
<p>
    "You deserve to be scared, just a little, for criticizing me in
    your thoughts.  Oh, don't think me frivolous," she pleaded, with
    another swift change.  "I realize it was all wrong.  And some time,
    by and by, after Charles has firmly established himself, after they
    really know him, I shall go to the bank people, or he will go to
    them, and tell the whole story.  By that time I'm sure&#8212;I'm sure
    they will forgive us both.  Don't you think so?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed would have forgiven her anything.  He nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin sure they will," he said.  Then, asking a question that had
    been in his thoughts for some time, he said: "How does your brother
    feel about it himself, Mrs. Ruth?"
</p>
<p>
    "At first he thought he should tell everything.  He did not want to
    take the position under false pretenses, he said.  But when I
    explained how he might lose this opportunity and what an
    opportunity it might be for us all he agreed that perhaps it was
    best to wait.  And I am sure it is best, Jed.  But then, I mean to
    put the whole dreadful business from my mind, if I can, and be
    happy with my little girl and my brother.  And I am happy; I feel
    almost like a girl myself.  So you mustn't remind me, Jed, and you
    mustn't criticize me, even though you and I both know you are
    right.  You are my only confidant, you know, and I don't know what
    in the world I should do without you, so try to bear with me, if
    you can."
</p>
<p>
    Jed observed that he guessed likely there wouldn't be much trouble
    at his end of the line, providing she could manage to worry along
    with a feller that went to sleep sittin' up, and in the daytime,
    like an owl.  After she had gone, however, he again relapsed into
    slumber, and his dreams, judging by his expression, must have been
    pleasant.
</p>
<p>
    That afternoon he had an unexpected visit.  He had just finished
    washing his dinner dishes and he and Babbie were in the outer shop
    together, when the visitor came.  Jed was droning "Old Hundred"
    with improvisations of his own, the said improvising having the
    effect of slowing down the already extremely deliberate anthem
    until the result compared to the original was for speed, as an
    oyster scow compared to an electric launch.  This musical crawl he
    used as an accompaniment to the sorting and piling of various parts
    of an order just received from a Southern resort.  Barbara was
    helping him, at least she called her activities "helping."  When
    Jed had finished counting a pile of vanes or mill parts she counted
    them to make sure.  Usually her count and his did not agree, so
    both counted again, getting in each other's way and, as Mr. Winslow
    expressed it, having a good time generally.  And this remark,
    intended to be facetious, was after all pretty close to the literal
    truth.  Certainly Babbie was enjoying herself, and Jed, where an
    impatient man would have been frantic, was enjoying her enjoyment.
    Petunia, perched in lopsided fashion on a heap of mill-sides was,
    apparently, superintending.
</p>
<p>
    "There!" declared Jed, stacking a dozen sailors beside a dozen of
    what the order called "birdhouses medium knocked down."  "There!
    that's the livin' last one, I do believe.  Hi hum!  Now we've got
    to box 'em, haven't we? . . .  Ye-es, yes, yes, yes. . . .
    Hum. . . .
</p>
<pre>     "'Di&#8212;de&#8212;di&#8212;de&#8212;di&#8212;de. . . ."
</pre>
<p>
    "Where's that hammer?  Oh, yes, here 'tis."
</p>
<pre>     "'Di&#8212;de&#8212;di&#8212;de&#8212;'
</pre>
<p>
    "Now where on earth have I put that pencil, Babbie?  Have I
    swallowed it?  DON'T tell me you've seen me swallow it, 'cause that
    flavor of lead-pencil never did agree with me."
</p>
<p>
    The child burst into a trill of laughter.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Uncle Jed," she exclaimed, "there it is, behind your ear."
</p>
<p>
    "Is it?  Sho, so 'tis!  Now that proves the instinct of dumb
    animals, don't it?  That lead-pencil knew enough to realize that my
    ear was so big that anything short of a cord-wood stick could hide
    behind it.  Tut, tut!  Surprisin', surprisin'!"
</p>
<p>
    "But, Uncle Jed, a pencil isn't an animal."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Ain't it?  Seemed to me I'd read somethin' about the ragin'
    lead-pencil seekin' whom it might devour.  But maybe that was a&#8212;
    er&#8212;lion or a clam or somethin'."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie looked at him in puzzled fashion for a moment.  Then she
    sagely shook her head and declared: "Uncle Jed, I think you are
    perfectly scru-she-aking.  Petunia and I are convulshed.  We&#8212;" she
    stopped, listened, and then announced: "Uncle Jed, I THINK somebody
    came up the walk."
</p>
<p>
    The thought received confirmation immediately in the form of a
    knock at the door.  Jed looked over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum," he mused, sadly, "there's no peace for the wicked, Babbie.
    No sooner get one order all fixed and out of the way than along
    comes a customer and you have to get another one ready.  If I'd
    known 'twas goin' to be like this I'd never have gone into
    business, would you?  But maybe 'tain't a customer, maybe it's
    Cap'n Sam or Gabe Bearse or somebody. . . .  They wouldn't knock,
    though, 'tain't likely; anyhow Gabe wouldn't. . . .  Come in," he
    called, as the knock was repeated.
</p>
<p>
    The person who entered the shop was a tall man in uniform.  The
    afternoon was cloudy and the outer shop, piled high with stock and
    lumber, was shadowy.  The man in uniform looked at Jed and Barbara
    and they looked at him.  He spoke first.
</p>
<p>
    "Pardon me," he said, "but is your name Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Yes, sir," he replied, deliberately.  "I guess likely
    'tis."
</p>
<p>
    "I have come here to see if you could let me have&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Babbie interrupted him.  Forgetting her manners in the excitement
    of the discovery which had just flashed upon her, she uttered an
    exclamation.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Uncle Jed!" she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed, startled, turned toward her.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?" he asked, hastily.  "What's the matter?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you know?  He&#8212;he's the nice officer one."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  The nice what?  What are you talkin' about, Babbie?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbie, now somewhat abashed and ashamed of her involuntary
    outburst, turned red and hesitated.
</p>
<p>
    "I mean," she stammered, "I mean he&#8212;he's the&#8212;officer one that&#8212;
    that was nice to us that day."
</p>
<p>
    "That day?  What day? . . .  Just excuse the little girl, won't
    you?" he added, apologetically, turning to the caller.  "She's made
    a mistake; she thinks she knows you, I guess."
</p>
<p>
    "But I DO, Uncle Jed.  Don't you remember?  Over at the flying
    place?"
</p>
<p>
    The officer himself took a step forward.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, of course," he said, pleasantly.  "She is quite right.  I
    thought your faces were familiar.  You and she were over at the
    camp that day when one of our construction plans was lost.  She
    found it for us.  And Lieutenant Rayburn and I have been grateful
    many times since," he added.
</p>
<p>
    Jed recognized him then.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I snum!" he exclaimed.  "Of course!  Sartin!  If it hadn't
    been for you I'd have lost my life and Babbie'd have lost her clam
    chowder.  That carpenter feller would have had me hung for a spy in
    ten minutes more.  I'm real glad to see you, Colonel&#8212;Colonel Wood.
    That's your name, if I recollect right."
</p>
<p>
    "Not exactly.  My name is Grover, and I'm not a colonel, worse
    luck, only a major."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Grover, eh?  Now how in the nation did I get it Wood?  Oh,
    yes, I cal'late 'twas mixin' up groves and woods.  Tut, tut!
    Wonder I didn't call you 'Pines' or 'Bushes' or somethin'. . . .
    But there, sit down, sit down.  I'm awful glad you dropped in.  I'd
    about given up hopin' you would."
</p>
<p>
    He brought forward a chair, unceremoniously dumping two stacks of
    carefully sorted and counted vanes and sailors from its seat to the
    floor prior to doing so.  Major Grover declined to sit.
</p>
<p>
    "I should like to, but I mustn't," he said.  "And I shouldn't claim
    credit for deliberately making you a social call.  I came&#8212;that is,
    I was sent here on a matter of&#8212;er&#8212;well, first aid to the injured.
    I came to see if you would lend me a crank."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at him.  "A&#8212;a what?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "A crank, a crank for my car.  I motored over from the camp and
    stopped at the telegraph office.  When I came out my car refused to
    go; the self-starter appears to have gone on a strike.  I had left
    my crank at the camp and my only hope seemed to be to buy or borrow
    one somewhere.  I asked the two or three fellows standing about the
    telegraph office where I might be likely to find one.  No one
    seemed to know, but just then the old grouch&#8212;excuse me, person who
    keeps the hardware store came along."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Phin Babbitt?  Little man with the stub of a paint brush
    growin' on his chin?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, that's the one.  I asked him where I should be likely to find
    a crank.  He said if I came across to this shop I ought to find
    one."
</p>
<p>
    "He did, eh? . . .  Hum!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, he did.  So I came."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum!"
</p>
<p>
    This observation being neither satisfying nor particularly
    illuminating, Major Grover waited for something more explicit.  He
    waited in vain; Mr. Winslow, his eyes fixed upon the toe of his
    visitor's military boot, appeared to be mesmerized.
</p>
<p>
    "So I came," repeated the major, after an interval.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, yes, yes.  So you did, so you did. . . .  Hum!"
</p>
<p>
    He rose and, walking to the window, peeped about the edge of the
    shade across and down the road in the direction of the telegraph
    office.
</p>
<p>
    "Phineas," he drawled, musingly, "and Squealer and Lute Small and
    Bluey.  Hu-u-m! . . .  Yes, yes."
</p>
<p>
    He turned away from the window and began intoning a hymn.  Major
    Grover seemed to be divided between a desire to laugh and a
    tendency toward losing patience.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he queried, after another interval, "about that crank?
    Have you one I might borrow?  It may not fit, probably won't, but I
    should like to try it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "There's a crank here," he drawled, "but it wouldn't
    be much use around automobiles, I'm afraid.  I'm it."
</p>
<p>
    "What?  I don't understand."
</p>
<p>
    "I say I'm it.  My pet name around Orham is town crank.  That's why
    Phineas sent you to my shop.  He said you OUGHT to find a crank
    here.  He was right, I'm 'most generally in."
</p>
<p>
    This statement was made quietly, deliberately and with no trace of
    resentment.  Having made it, the speaker began picking up the vanes
    and sailors he had spilled when he proffered his visitor the chair.
    Major Grover colored, and frowned.
</p>
<p>
    "Do you mean to tell me," he demanded, "that that fellow sent me
    over here because&#8212;because&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Because I'm town crank?  Ye-es, that's what I mean."
</p>
<p>
    "Indeed!  That is his idea of a joke, is it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Seems to be.  He's an awful comical critter, Phin Babbitt is&#8212;in
    his own way."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, it's not my way.  He sends me over here to make an ass of
    myself and insult you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, Major, excuse me.  Phin didn't have any idea that you'd
    insult me.  You see," with the fleeting smile, "he wouldn't believe
    anybody could do that."
</p>
<p>
    Grover turned sharply to the door.  Mr. Winslow spoke his name.
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;Major Grover," he said, gently, "I wouldn't."
</p>
<p>
    The major paused.  "Wouldn't what?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "Go over there and tell Phin and the rest what you think of 'em.
    If 'twould do 'em any good I'd say, 'For mercy sakes, go!'  But
    'twouldn't; they wouldn't believe it."
</p>
<p>
    Grover's lips tightened.
</p>
<p>
    "Telling it might do ME some good," he observed, significantly.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I know.  But maybe we might get the same good or more in a
    different way. . . .  Hum! . . .  What&#8212;er&#8212;brand of automobile is
    yours?"
</p>
<p>
    The major told him.  Jed nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum . . . yes," he drawled.  "I see. . . .  I see."
</p>
<p>
    Grover laughed.  "I'll be hanged if I do!" he observed.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh! . . .  Well, I tell you; you sit down and let Babbie talk
    Petunia to you a minute or two.  I'll be right back."
</p>
<p>
    He hurried into the back shop, closing the door after him.  A
    moment later Grover caught a glimpse of him crossing the back yard
    and disappearing over the edge of the bluff.
</p>
<p>
    "Where in the world has the fellow gone?" he soliloquized aloud,
    amused although impatient.  Barbara took it upon herself to answer.
    Uncle Jed had left the caller in her charge and she felt her
    responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    "He's gone down the shore path," she said.  "I don't know where
    else he's gone, but it's all right, anyway."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, is it?  You seem quite sure of it, young lady."
</p>
<p>
    "I am.  Everything Uncle Jed does is right.  Sometimes you don't
    think so at first, but it turns out that way.  Mamma says he is
    petunia&#8212;no, I mean peculiar but&#8212;but very&#8212;re-li-a-ble," the last
    word conquered after a visible struggle.  "She says if you do what
    he tells you to you will be 'most always glad.  I think 'always'
    without any 'most,'" she added.
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover laughed.  "That's a reputation for infallibility worth
    having," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara did not know what he meant but she had no intention of
    betraying that fact.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," she agreed.  A moment later she suggested: "Don't you think
    you'd better sit down?  He told you to, you know."
</p>
<p>
    "Great Scott, so he did!  I must obey orders, mustn't I?  But he
    told you to talk&#8212;something or other to me, I think.  What was it?"
</p>
<p>
    "He told me to talk Petunia to you.  There she is&#8212;up there."
</p>
<p>
    The major regarded Petunia, who was seated upon the heap of mill-
    sides, in a most haphazard and dissipated attitude.
</p>
<p>
    "She is my oldest daughter," continued Barbara.  "She's very
    advanced for her years."
</p>
<p>
    "Dear me!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  And . . . oh, here comes Mamma!"
</p>
<p>
    Mrs. Armstrong entered the shop.  The major rose.  Barbara did the
    honors.
</p>
<p>
    "I was just going to come in, Mamma," she explained, "but Uncle Jed
    asked me to stay and talk to Mr.&#8212;I mean Major&#8212;Grover till he came
    back.  He's gone out, but he won't be long.  Mamma, this is Mr.
    Major Grover, the one who kept Uncle Jed from being spied, over at
    the flying place that day when I found the plan paper and he made a
    shingle boat sail out of it."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth came forward.  She had been walking along the edge of the
    bluff, looking out over the tumbled gray and white water, and the
    late October wind had tossed her hair and brought the color to her
    cheeks.  She put out her hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes," she said.  "How do you do, Major Grover?  I have heard a
    great deal about you since the day of Babbie's picnic.  I'm sure I
    owe you an apology for the trouble my small daughter must have
    caused that day."
</p>
<p>
    She and the major shook hands.  The latter expressed himself as
    being very glad to meet Mrs. Armstrong.  He looked as if he meant
    it.
</p>
<p>
    "And no apologies are due, not from your side at least," he
    declared.  "If it had not been for your little girl our missing
    plan might have been missing yet."
</p>
<p>
    Fifteen minutes elapsed before the owner of the windmill shop
    returned.  When he did come hurrying up the bluff and in at the
    back door, heated and out of breath, no one seemed to have missed
    him greatly.  Major Grover, who might reasonably have been expected
    to show some irritation at his long wait, appeared quite oblivious
    of the fact that he had waited at all.  He and Barbara were seated
    side by side upon a packing case, while Ruth occupied the chair.
    When Jed came panting in it was Babbie who greeted him.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Uncle Jed!" she exclaimed, "you just ought to have been here.
    Mr.&#8212;I mean Major Grover has been telling Mamma and me about going
    up in a&#8212;in a diggible balloon.  It was awf'ly interesting.  Wasn't
    it, Mamma?"
</p>
<p>
    Her mother laughingly agreed that it was.  Jed, whose hands were
    full, deposited his burden upon another packing case.  The said
    burden consisted of no less than three motor car cranks.  Grover
    regarded them with surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Where in the world did you get those?" he demanded.  "The last I
    saw of you you were disappearing over that bank, apparently headed
    out to sea.  Do you dig those things up on the flats hereabouts,
    like clams?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Not's I know of," he replied.  "I borrowed
    these down at Joshua Rogers' garage."
</p>
<p>
    "Rogers' garage?" repeated Grover.  "That isn't near here, is it?"
</p>
<p>
    "It is an eighth of a mile from here," declared Ruth.  "And not
    down by the beach, either.  What do you mean, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was standing by the front window, peeping out.  "Um-hm," he
    said, musingly, "they're still there, the whole lot of 'em, waitin'
    for you to come out, Major. . . .  Hum . . . dear, dear!  And
    they're all doubled up now laughin' ahead of time. . . .  Dear,
    dear! this is a world of disappointment, sure enough."
</p>
<p>
    "What ARE you talking about?" demanded Major Grover.
</p>
<p>
    "JED!" exclaimed Ruth.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara said nothing.  She was accustomed to her Uncle Jed's
    vagaries and knew that, in his own good time, an explanation would
    be forthcoming.  It came now.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, you see," said Jed, "Phin Babbitt and the rest sendin' you
    over here to find a crank was their little joke.  They're enjoyin'
    it now.  The one thing needed to make 'em happy for life is to see
    you come out of here empty-handed and so b'ilin' mad that you froth
    over.  If you come out smilin' and with what you came after, why&#8212;
    why, then the cream of their joke has turned a little sour, as you
    might say.  See?"
</p>
<p>
    Grover laughed.  "Yes, I see that plain enough," he agreed.  "And
    I'm certainly obliged to you.  I owed those fellows one.  But what
    I don't see is how you got those cranks by going down to the
    seashore."
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll, if I'd gone straight up the road to Rogers's our jokin'
    friends would have known that's where the cranks came from.  I
    wanted 'em to think they came from right here.  So I went over the
    bank back of the shop, where they couldn't see me, along the beach
    till I got abreast of Joshua's and then up across lots.  I came
    back the way I went.  I hope those things 'll fit, Major.  One of
    'em will, I guess likely."
</p>
<p>
    The major laughed again.  "I certainly am obliged to you, Mr.
    Winslow," he said.  "And I must say you took a lot of trouble on my
    account."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed, although there was a little twinkle in his eye.
</p>
<p>
    "'Twan't altogether on your account," he drawled.  "I owed 'em one,
    same as you did.  I was the crank they sent you to."
</p>
<p>
    Their visitor bade Barbara and her mother good afternoon, gathered
    up his cranks and turned to the door.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll step over and start the car," he said.  "Then I'll come back
    and return these things."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.  "I wouldn't," he said.  "You may stop again
    before you get back to Bayport.  Rogers is in no hurry for 'em, he
    said so.  You take 'em along and fetch 'em in next time you're
    over.  I want you to call again anyhow and these cranks 'll make a
    good excuse for doin' it," he added.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I see.  Yes, so they will.  With that understanding I'll take
    them along.  Thanks again and good afternoon."
</p>
<p>
    He hastened across the street.  The two in the shop watched from
    the window until the car started and moved out of sight.  The group
    by the telegraph office seemed excited about something; they
    laughed no longer and there was considerable noisy argument.
</p>
<p>
    Jed's lip twitched.  "'The best laid plans of mice&#8212;and skunks,'"
    he quoted, solemnly.  "Hm! . . .  That Major Grover seems like a
    good sort of chap."
</p>
<p>
    "I think he's awful nice," declared Babbie.
</p>
<p>
    Ruth said nothing.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIII
</h2>
<p>
    October passed and November came.  The very last of the summer
    cottages were closed.  Orham settled down for its regular winter
    hibernation.  This year it was a bit less of a nap than usual
    because of the activity at the aviation camp at East Harniss.  The
    swarm of carpenters, plumbers and mechanics was larger than ever
    there now and the buildings were hastening toward completion, for
    the first allotment of aviators, soldiers and recruits was due to
    arrive in March.  Major Grover was a busy and a worried man, but he
    usually found time to drop in at the windmill shop for a moment or
    two on each of his brief motor trips to Orham.  Sometimes he found
    Jed alone, more often Barbara was there also, and, semi-
    occasionally, Ruth.  The major and Charles Phillips met and
    appeared to like each other.  Charles was still on the rising tide
    of local popularity.  Even Gabe Bearse had a good word to say for
    him among the many which he said concerning him.  Phineas Babbitt,
    however, continued to express dislike, or, at the most,
    indifference.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm too old a bird," declared the vindictive little hardware
    dealer, "to bow down afore a slick tongue and a good-lookin'
    figgerhead.  He's one of Sam Hunniwell's pets and that's enough for
    me.  Anybody that ties up to Sam Hunniwell must have a rotten plank
    in 'em somewheres; give it time and 'twill come out."
</p>
<p>
    Charles and Jed Winslow were by this time good friends.  The young
    man usually spent at least a few minutes of each day chatting with
    his eccentric neighbor.  They were becoming more intimate, at times
    almost confidential, although Phillips, like every other friend or
    acquaintance of "Shavings" Winslow, was inclined to patronize or
    condescend a bit in his relations with the latter.  No one took the
    windmill maker altogether seriously, not even Ruth Armstrong,
    although she perhaps came nearest to doing so.  Charles would drop
    in at the shop of a morning, in the interval between breakfast and
    bank opening, and, perching on a pile of stock, or the workbench,
    would discuss various things.  He and Jed were alike in one
    characteristic&#8212;each had the habit of absent-mindedness and lapsing
    into silence in the middle of a conversation.  Jed's lapses, of
    course, were likely to occur in the middle of a sentence, even in
    the middle of a word; with the younger man the symptoms were not so
    acute.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Charlie," observed Mr. Winslow, on one occasion, a raw
    November morning of the week before Thanksgiving, "how's the bank
    gettin' along?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles was a bit more silent that morning than he had been of
    late.  He appeared to be somewhat reflective, even somber.  Jed, on
    the lookout for just such symptoms, was trying to cheer him up.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, all right enough, I guess," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
    "Like your work as well as ever, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;oh, yes, I like it, what there is of it.  It isn't what you'd
    call strenuous."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I presume likely not, but I shouldn't wonder if they gave you
    somethin' more responsible some of these days.  They know you're up
    to doin' it; Cap'n Sam's told me so more'n once."
</p>
<p>
    Here occurred one of the lapses just mentioned.  Phillips said
    nothing for a minute or more.  Then he asked: "What sort of a man
    is Captain Hunniwell?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  What sort of a man?  You ought to know him yourself pretty
    well by this time.  You see more of him every day than I do."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't mean as a business man or anything like that.  I mean what
    sort of man is he&#8212;er&#8212;inside?  Is he always as good-natured as he
    seems?  How is he around his own house?  With his daughter&#8212;or&#8212;or
    things like that?  You've known him all your life, you know, and I
    haven't."
</p>
<p>
    "Um&#8212;ye-es&#8212;yes, I've known Sam for a good many years.  He's square
    all through, Sam is.  Honest as the day is long and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Charles stirred uneasily.  "I know that, of course," he interrupted.
    "I wasn't questioning his honesty."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's tender conscience registered a pang.  The reference to
    honesty had not been made with any ulterior motive.
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin, sartin," he said; "I know you wasn't, Charlie, course I
    know that.  You wanted to know what sort of a man Sam was in his
    family and such, I judge.  Well, he's a mighty good father&#8212;almost
    too good, I suppose likely some folks would say.  He just bows down
    and worships that daughter of his.  Anything Maud wants that he can
    give her she can have.  And she wants a good deal, I will give in,"
    he added, with his quiet drawl.
</p>
<p>
    His caller did not speak.  Jed whistled a few mournful bars and
    sharpened a chisel on an oilstone.
</p>
<p>
    "If John D. Vanderbilt should come around courtin' Maud," he went
    on, after a moment, "I don't know as Sam would cal'late he was good
    enough for her.  Anyhow he'd feel that 'twas her that was doin' the
    favor, not John D. . . .  And I guess he'd be right; I don't know
    any Vanderbilts, but I've known Maud since she was a baby.  She's a&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He paused, inspecting a nick in the chisel edge.  Again Phillips
    shifted in his seat on the edge of the workbench.
</p>
<p>
    "Well?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?"  Jed looked up in mild inquiry.  "What is it?" he said.
</p>
<p>
    "That's what I want to know&#8212;what is it?  You were talking about
    Maud Hunniwell.  You said you had known her since she was a baby
    and that she was&#8212;something or other; that was as far as you got."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho! . . .  Hum. . . .  Oh, yes, yes; I was goin' to say she was a
    mighty nice girl, as nice as she is good-lookin' and lively.
    There's a dozen young chaps in this county crazy about her this
    minute, but there ain't any one of 'em good enough for her. . . .
    Hello, you goin' so soon?  'Tisn't half-past nine yet, is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips did not answer.  His somber expression was still in
    evidence.  Jed would have liked to cheer him up, but he did not
    know how.  However he made an attempt by changing the subject.
</p>
<p>
    "How is Babbie this mornin'?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "She's as lively as a cricket, of course.  And full of excitement.
    She's going to school next Monday, you know.  You'll rather miss
    her about the shop here, won't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Miss her!  My land of Goshen!  I shouldn't be surprised if I
    follered her to school myself, like Mary's little lamb.  Miss her!
    Don't talk!"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, so long. . . .  What is it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "What is it you want to say?  You look as if you wanted to say
    something."
</p>
<p>
    "Do I? . . .  Hum. . . .  Oh, 'twasn't anything special. . . .
    How's&#8212;er&#8212;how's your sister this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, she's well.  I haven't seen her so well since&#8212;that is, for a
    long time.  You've made a great hit with Sis, Jed," he added, with
    a laugh.  "She can't say enough good things about you.  Says you
    are her one dependable in Orham, or something like that."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's face turned a bright red.  "Oh, sho, sho!" he protested, "she
    mustn't talk that way.  I haven't done anything."
</p>
<p>
    "She says you have.  Well, by-by."
</p>
<p>
    He went away.  It was some time before Jed resumed his chisel-
    sharpening.
</p>
<p>
    Later, when he came to reflect upon his conversation with young
    Phillips there were one or two things about it which puzzled him.
    They were still puzzling him when Maud Hunniwell came into the
    shop.  Maud, in a new fall suit, hat and fur, was a picture, a fact
    of which she was as well aware as the next person.  Jed, as always,
    was very glad to see her.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, well!" he exclaimed.  "Talk about angels and&#8212;and they fly
    in, so to speak.  Real glad to see you, Maud.  Sit down, sit down.
    There's a chair 'round here somewheres.  Now where&#8212;?  Oh, yes, I'm
    sittin' in it.  Hum!  That's one of the reasons why I didn't see
    it, I presume likely.  You take it and I'll fetch another from the
    kitchen.  No, I won't, I'll sit on the bench. . . .  Hum . . . has
    your pa got any money left in that bank of his?"
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell was, naturally, surprised at the question.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, I hope so," she said.  "Did you think he hadn't?"
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll, I didn't know.  That dress of yours, and that new
    bonnet, must have used up consider'ble, to say nothin' of that
    woodchuck you've got 'round your neck.  'Tis a woodchuck, ain't
    it?" he added, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
    "Woodchuck!  Well, I like that!  If you knew what a silver fox
    costs and how long I had to coax before I got this one you would be
    more careful in your language," she declared, with a toss of her
    head.
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "That's the trouble with me," he observed.  "I never
    know enough to pick out the right things&#8212;or folks&#8212;to be careful
    with.  If I set out to be real toady and humble to what I think is
    a peacock it generally turns out to be a Shanghai rooster.  And the
    same when it's t'other way about.  It's a great gift to be able to
    tell the real&#8212;er&#8212;what is it?&#8212;gold foxes from the woodchucks in
    this life.  I ain't got it and that's one of the two hundred
    thousand reasons why I ain't rich."
</p>
<p>
    He began to hum one of his doleful melodies.  Maud laughed.
</p>
<p>
    "Mercy, what a long sermon!" she exclaimed.  "No wonder you sing a
    hymn after it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sniffed.  "Um . . . ye-es," he drawled.  "If I was more
    worldly-minded I'd take up a collection, probably.  Well, how's all
    the United States Army; the gold lace part of it, I mean?"
</p>
<p>
    His visitor laughed again.  "Those that I know seem to be very well
    and happy," she replied.
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes . . . sartin.  They'd be happy, naturally.  How could
    they help it, under the circumstances?"
</p>
<p>
    He began picking over an assortment of small hardware, varying his
    musical accompaniment by whistling instead of singing.  His visitor
    looked at him rather oddly.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she observed, "you're changed."
</p>
<p>
    Changed?  I ain't changed my clothes, if that's what you mean.
    Course if I'd know I was goin' to have bankers' daughters with
    gold&#8212;er&#8212;muskrats 'round their necks come to see me I'd have
    dressed up."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't mean your clothes.  I mean you&#8212;yourself&#8212;you've
    changed."
</p>
<p>
    "I've changed!  How, for mercy sakes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, lots of ways.  You pay the ladies compliments now.  You
    wouldn't have done that a year ago."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Pay compliments?  I'm afraid you're mistaken.  Your pa says
    I'm so absent-minded and forgetful that I don't pay some of my
    bills till the folks I owe 'em to make proclamations they're goin'
    to sue me; and other bills I pay two or three times over."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't try to escape by dodging the subject.  You HAVE changed in
    the last few months.  I think," holding the tail of the silver fox
    before her face and regarding him over it, "I think you must be in
    love."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?"  Jed looked positively frightened.  "In love!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  You're blushing now."
</p>
<p>
    "Now, now, Maud, that ain't&#8212;that's sunburn."
</p>
<p>
    "No, it's not sunburn.  Who is it, Jed?" mischievously.  "Is it the
    pretty widow?  Is it Mrs. Armstrong?"
</p>
<p>
    A good handful of the hardware fell to the floor.  Jed thankfully
    scrambled down to pick it up.  Miss Hunniwell, expressing
    contrition at being indirectly responsible for the mishap, offered
    to help him.  He declined, of course, but in the little argument
    which followed the dangerous and embarrassing topic was forgotten.
    It was not until she was about to leave the shop that Maud again
    mentioned the Armstrong name.  And then, oddly enough, it was she,
    not Mr. Winslow, who showed embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she said, "what do you suppose I came here for this morning?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's reply was surprisingly prompt.
</p>
<p>
    "To show your new rig-out, of course," he said.  "'Vanity of
    vanities, all is vanity.'  There, NOW I can take up a collection,
    can't I?"
</p>
<p>
    His visitor pouted.  "If you do I shan't put anything in the box,"
    she declared.  "The idea of thinking that I came here just to show
    off my new things.  I've a good mind not to invite you at all now."
</p>
<p>
    She doubtless expected apologies and questions as to what
    invitation was meant.  They might have been forthcoming had not the
    windmill maker been engaged just at that moment in gazing
    abstractedly at the door of the little stove which heated, or was
    intended to heat, the workshop.  He did not appear to have heard
    her remark, so the young lady repeated it.  Still he paid no
    attention.  Miss Maud, having inherited a goodly share of the
    Hunniwell disposition, demanded an explanation.
</p>
<p>
    "What in the world is the matter with you?" she asked.  "Why are
    you staring at that stove?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed started and came to life.  "Eh?" he exclaimed.  "Oh, I was
    thinkin' what an everlastin' nuisance 'twas&#8212;the stove, I mean.  It
    needs more wood about every five minutes in the day, seems to&#8212;
    needs it now, that's what made me think of it.  I was just
    wonderin' if 'twouldn't be a good notion to set it up out in the
    yard."
</p>
<p>
    "Out in the yard?  Put the stove out in the yard?  For goodness'
    sake, what for?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed clasped his knee in his hand and swung his foot back and forth.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh" he drawled, "if 'twas out in the yard I shouldn't know whether
    it needed wood or not, so 'twouldn't be all the time botherin' me."
</p>
<p>
    However, he rose and replenished the stove.  Miss Hunniwell
    laughed.  Then she said: "Jed, you don't deserve it, because you
    didn't hear me when I first dropped the hint, but I came here
    with an invitation for you.  Pa and I expect you to eat your
    Thanksgiving dinner with us."
</p>
<p>
    If she had asked him to eat it in jail Jed could not have been more
    disturbed.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Maud," he stammered, "I&#8212;I'm ever so much obliged to
    you, but I&#8212;I don't see how&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Nonsense!  I see how perfectly well.  You always act just this way
    whenever I invite you to anything.  You're not afraid of Pa or me,
    are you?"
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll, well, I ain't afraid of your Pa 's I know of, but of
    course, when such a fascinatin' young woman as you comes along, all
    rigged up to kill, why, it's natural that an old single relic like
    me should get kind of nervous."
</p>
<p>
    Maud clasped her hands.  "Oh," she cried, "there's another
    compliment!  You HAVE changed, Jed.  I'm going to ask Father what
    it means."
</p>
<p>
    This time Jed was really alarmed.  "Now, now, now," he protested,
    "don't go tell your Pa yarns about me.  He'll come in here and
    pester me to death.  You know what a tease he is when he gets
    started.  Don't, Maud, don't."
</p>
<p>
    She looked hugely delighted at the prospect.  Her eyes sparkled
    with mischief.  "I certainly shall tell him," she declared, "unless
    you promise to eat with us on Thanksgiving Day.  Oh, come along,
    don't be so silly.  You've eaten at our house hundreds of times."
</p>
<p>
    This was a slight exaggeration.  Jed had eaten there possibly five
    times in the last five years.  He hesitated.
</p>
<p>
    "Ain't goin' to be any other company, is there?" he asked, after a
    moment.  It was now that Maud showed her first symptoms of
    embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
    "Why," she said, twirling the fox tail and looking at the floor,
    "there may be one or two more.  I thought&#8212;I mean Pa and I thought
    perhaps we might invite Mrs. Armstrong and Babbie.  You know them,
    Jed, so they won't be like strangers.  And Pa thinks Mrs. Armstrong
    is a very nice lady, a real addition to the town; I've heard him
    say so often," she added, earnestly.
</p>
<p>
    Jed was silent.  She looked up at him from under the brim of the
    new hat.
</p>
<p>
    "You wouldn't mind them, Jed, would you?" she asked.  "They
    wouldn't be like strangers, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "I&#8212;I don't know's I would," he mused,
    "always providin' they didn't mind me.  But I don't cal'late Mrs.
    Ruth&#8212;Mrs. Armstrong, I mean&#8212;would want to leave Charlie to home
    alone on Thanksgivin' Day.  If she took Babbie, you know, there
    wouldn't be anybody left to keep him company."
</p>
<p>
    Miss Hunniwell twirled the fox tail in an opposite direction.  "Oh,
    of course," she said, with elaborate carelessness, "we should
    invite Mrs. Armstrong's brother if we invited her.  Of course we
    should HAVE to do that."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, but he made no comment.  His visitor watched him from
    beneath the hat brim.
</p>
<p>
    "You&#8212;you haven't any objection to Mr. Phillips, have you?" she
    queried.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Objections?  To Charlie?  Oh, no, no."
</p>
<p>
    "You like him, don't you?  Father likes him very much."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, indeed; like him fust-rate.  All hands like Charlie, the
    women-folks especially."
</p>
<p>
    There was a perceptible interval before Miss Hunniwell spoke again.
    "What do you mean by that?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, nothin', except that, accordin' to your dad, he's a
    'specially good hand at waitin' on the women and girls up at the
    bank, polite and nice to 'em, you know.  He's even made a hit with
    old Melissy Busteed, and it takes a regular feller to do that."
</p>
<p>
    He would not promise to appear at the Hunniwell home on
    Thanksgiving, but he did agree to think it over.  Maud had to be
    content with that.  However, she declared that she should take his
    acceptance for granted.
</p>
<p>
    "We shall set a place for you," she said.  "Of course you'll come.
    It will be such a nice party, you and Pa and Mrs. Armstrong and I
    and little Babbie.  Oh, we'll have great fun, see if we don't."
</p>
<p>
    "And Charlie; you're leavin' out Charlie," Jed reminded her.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes, so I was.  Well, I suppose he'll come, too.  Good-by."
</p>
<p>
    She skipped away, waving him a farewell with the tail of the silver
    fox.  Jed, gazing after her, rubbed his chin reflectively.
</p>
<p>
    His indecision concerning the acceptance of the Hunniwell
    invitation lasted until the day before Thanksgiving.  Then Barbara
    added her persuasions to those of Captain Sam and his daughter and
    he gave in.
</p>
<p>
    "If you don't go, Uncle Jed," asserted Babbie, "we're all goin' to
    be awfully disappointed, 'specially me and Petunia&#8212;and Mamma&#8212;and
    Uncle Charlie."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, then the rest of you folks won't care, I presume likely?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbie thought it over.  "Why, there aren't any more of us," she
    said.  "Oh, I see!  You're joking again, aren't you, Uncle Jed?
    'Most everybody I know laughs when they make jokes, but you don't,
    you look as if you were going to cry.  That's why I don't laugh
    sometimes right off," she explained, politely.  "If you was really
    feeling so bad it wouldn't be nice to laugh, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed laughed then, himself.  "So Petunia would feel bad if I didn't
    go to Sam's, would she?" he inquired.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," solemnly.  "She told me she shouldn't eat one single thing
    if you didn't go.  She's a very high-strung child."
</p>
<p>
    That settled it.  Jed argued that Petunia must on no account be
    strung higher than she was and consented to dine at the
    Hunniwells'.
</p>
<p>
    The day before Thanksgiving brought another visitor to the windmill
    shop, one as welcome as he was unexpected.  Jed, hearing the door
    to the stock room open, shouted "Come in" from his seat at the
    workbench in the inner room.  When his summons was obeyed he looked
    up to see a khaki-clad figure advancing with extended hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, hello, Major!" he exclaimed.  "I'm real glad to&#8212;  Eh,
    'tain't Major Grover, is it?  Who&#8212;  Why, Leander Babbitt!  Well,
    well, well!"
</p>
<p>
    Young Babbitt was straight and square-shouldered and brown.
    Military training and life at Camp Devens had wrought the miracle
    in his case which it works in so many.  Jed found it hard to
    recognize the stoop-shouldered son of the hardware dealer in the
    spruce young soldier before him.  When he complimented Leander upon
    the improvement the latter disclaimed any credit.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank the drill master second and yourself first, Jed," he said.
    "They'll make a man of a fellow up there at Ayer if he'll give 'em
    half a chance.  Probably I shouldn't have had the chance if it
    hadn't been for you.  You were the one who really put me up to
    enlisting."
</p>
<p>
    Jed refused to listen.  "Can't make a man out of a punkinhead," he
    asserted.  "If you hadn't had the right stuff in you, Leander,
    drill masters nor nobody else could have fetched it out.  How do
    you like belongin' to Uncle Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    Young Babbitt liked it and said so.  "I feel as if I were doing
    something at last," he said; "as if I was part of the biggest thing
    in the world.  Course I'm only a mighty little part, but, after
    all, it's something."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, gravely.  "You bet it's somethin'," he argued.  "It's a
    lot, a whole lot.  I only wish I was standin' alongside of you in
    the ranks, Leander. . . .  I'd be a sight, though, wouldn't I?" he
    added, his lip twitching in the fleeting smile.  "What do you think
    the Commodore, or General, or whoever 'tis bosses things at the
    camp, would say when he saw me?  He'd think the flagpole had grown
    feet, and was walkin' round, I cal'late."
</p>
<p>
    He asked his young friend what reception he met with upon his
    return home.  Leander smiled ruefully.
</p>
<p>
    "My step-mother seemed glad enough to see me," he said.  "She and I
    had some long talks on the subject and I think she doesn't blame me
    much for going into the service.  I told her the whole story and,
    down in her heart, I believe she thinks I did right."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Don't see how she could help it," he said.  "How does
    your dad take it?"
</p>
<p>
    Leander hesitated.  "Well," he said, "you know Father.  He doesn't
    change his mind easily.  He and I didn't get as close together as I
    wish we could.  And it wasn't my fault that we didn't," he added,
    earnestly.
</p>
<p>
    Jed understood.  He had known Phineas Babbitt for many years and he
    knew the little man's hard, implacable disposition and the violence
    of his prejudices.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," he said.  "All the same, Leander, I believe your father
    thinks more of you than he does of anything else on earth."
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't wonder if you was right, Jed.  But on the other hand
    I'm afraid he and I will never be the same after I come back from
    the war&#8212;always providing I do come back, of course."
</p>
<p>
    "Sshh, sshh!  Don't talk that way.  Course you'll come back."
</p>
<p>
    "You never can tell.  However, if I knew I wasn't going to, it
    wouldn't make any difference in my feelings about going.  I'm glad
    I enlisted and I'm mighty thankful to you for backing me up in it.
    I shan't forget it, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho!  It's easy to tell other folks what to do.  That's how
    the Kaiser earns his salary; only he gives advice to the Almighty,
    and I ain't got as far along as that yet."
</p>
<p>
    They discussed the war in general and by sections.  Just before he
    left, young Babbitt said:
</p>
<p>
    "Jed, there is one thing that worries me a little in connection
    with Father.  He was bitter against the war before we went into it
    and before he and Cap'n Sam Hunniwell had their string of rows.
    Since then and since I enlisted he has been worse than ever.  The
    things he says against the government and against the country make
    ME want to lick him&#8212;and I'm his own son.  I am really scared for
    fear he'll get himself jailed for being a traitor or something of
    that sort."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow asked if Phineas' feeling against Captain Hunniwell had
    softened at all.  Leander's reply was a vigorous negative.
</p>
<p>
    "Not a bit," he declared.  "He hates the cap'n worse than ever, if
    that's possible, and he'll do him some bad turn some day, if he
    can, I'm afraid.  You must think it's queer my speaking this way of
    my own father," he added.  "Well, I don't to any one else.  Somehow
    a fellow always feels as if he could say just what he thinks to
    you, Jed Winslow.  I feel that way, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
    He and Jed shook hands at the door in the early November twilight.
    Leander was to eat his Thanksgiving dinner at home and then leave
    for camp on the afternoon train.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, good-by," he said.
</p>
<p>
    Jed seemed loath to relinquish the handclasp.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, don't say good-by; it's just 'See you later,'" he replied.
</p>
<p>
    Leander smiled.  "Of course.  Well, then, see you later, Jed.
    We'll write once in a while; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed promised.  The young fellow strode off into the dusk.  Somehow,
    with his square shoulders and his tanned, resolute country face, he
    seemed to typify Young America setting cheerfully forth to face&#8212;
    anything&#8212;that Honor and Decency may still be more than empty words
    in this world of ours.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIV
</h2>
<p>
    The Hunniwell Thanksgiving dinner was an entire success.  Even
    Captain Sam himself was forced to admit it, although he professed
    to do so with reluctance.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said, with an elaborate wink in the direction of his
    guests, "it's a pretty good dinner, considerin' everything.  Of
    course 'tain't what a feller used to get down at Sam Coy's eatin'-
    house on Atlantic Avenue, but it's pretty good&#8212;as I say, when
    everything's considered."
</p>
<p>
    His daughter was highly indignant.  "Do you mean to say that this
    dinner isn't as good as those you used to get at that Boston
    restaurant, Pa?" she demanded.  "Don't you dare say such a thing."
</p>
<p>
    Her father tugged at his beard and looked tremendously solemn.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he observed, "as a boy I was brought up to always speak the
    truth and I've tried to live up to my early trainin'.  Speakin' as
    a truthful man, then, I'm obliged to say that this dinner ain't
    like those I used to get at Sam Coy's."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth put in a word.  "Well, then, Captain Hunniwell," she said, "I
    think the restaurant you refer to must be one of the best in the
    world."
</p>
<p>
    Before the captain could reply, Maud did it for him.
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Armstrong," she cautioned, "you mustn't take my father too
    seriously.  He dearly loves to catch people with what he hopes is a
    joke.  For a minute he caught even me this time, but I see through
    him now.  He didn't say the dinner at his precious restaurant was
    BETTER than this one, he said it wasn't like it, that's all.  Which
    is probably true," she added, with withering scorn.  "But what I
    should like to know is what he means by his 'everything
    considered.'"
</p>
<p>
    Her father's gravity was unshaken.  "Well," he said, "all I meant
    was that this was a pretty good dinner, considerin' who was
    responsible for gettin' it up."
</p>
<p>
    "I see, I see.  Mrs. Ellis, our housekeeper, and I are responsible,
    Mrs. Armstrong, so you understand now who he is shooting at.  Very
    well, Pa," she added, calmly, "the rest of us will have our dessert
    now.  You can get yours at Sam Coy's."
</p>
<p>
    The dessert was mince pie and a Boston frozen pudding, the latter
    an especial favorite of Captain Sam's.  He capitulated at once.
</p>
<p>
    "'Kamerad!  Kamerad!'" he cried, holding up both hands.  "That's
    what the Germans say when they surrender, ain't it?  I give in,
    Maud.  You can shoot me against a stone wall, if you want to, only
    give me my frozen puddin' first.  It ain't so much that I like the
    puddin'," he explained to Mrs. Armstrong, "but I never can make out
    whether it's flavored with tansy or spearmint.  Maud won't tell me,
    but I know it's somethin' old-fashioned and reminds me of my
    grandmother; or, maybe, it's my grandfather; come to think, I guess
    likely 'tis."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth grasped his meaning later when she tasted the pudding and
    found it flavored with New England rum.
</p>
<p>
    After dinner they adjourned to the parlor.  Maud, being coaxed by
    her adoring father, played the piano.  Then she sang.  Then they
    all sang, all except Jed and the captain, that is.  The latter
    declared that his voice had mildewed in the damp weather they had
    been having lately, and Jed excused himself on the ground that he
    had been warned not to sing because it was not healthy.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara was surprised and shocked.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Uncle Jed!" she cried.  "You sing EVER so much.  I heard you
    singing this morning."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Ye-es," he drawled, "but I was alone then and I'm
    liable to take chances with my own health.  Bluey Batcheldor was in
    the shop last week, though, when I was tunin' up and it disagreed
    with HIM."
</p>
<p>
    "I don't believe it, Uncle Jed," with righteous indignation.  "How
    do you know it did?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause he said so.  He listened a spell, and then said I made him
    sick, so I took his word for it."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam laughed uproariously.  "You must be pretty bad then,
    Jed," he declared.  "Anybody who disagrees with Bluey Batcheldor
    must be pretty nigh the limit."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Um-hm," he said, reflectively, "pretty nigh, but not
    quite.  Always seemed to me the real limit was anybody who agreed
    with him."
</p>
<p>
    So Jed, with Babbie on his knee, sat in the corner of the bay
    window looking out on the street, while Mrs. Armstrong and her
    brother and Miss Hunniwell played and sang and the captain
    applauded vigorously and loudly demanded more.  After a time Ruth
    left the group at the piano and joined Jed and her daughter by the
    window.  Captain Hunniwell came a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
    "Make a good-lookin' couple, don't they?" he whispered, bending
    down, and with a jerk of his head in the direction of the
    musicians.  "Your brother's a fine-lookin' young chap, Mrs.
    Armstrong.  And he acts as well as he looks.  Don't know when I've
    taken such a shine to a young feller as I have to him.  Yes, ma'am,
    they make a good-lookin' couple, even if one of 'em is my
    daughter."
</p>
<p>
    The speech was made without the slightest thought or suggestion of
    anything but delighted admiration and parental affection.
    Nevertheless, Ruth, to whom it was made, started slightly, and,
    turning, regarded the pair at the piano.  Maud was fingering the
    pages of a book of college songs and looking smilingly up into the
    face of Charles Phillips, who was looking down into hers.  There
    was, apparently, nothing in the picture&#8212;a pretty one, by the way&#8212;
    to cause Mrs. Armstrong to gaze so fixedly or to bring the slight
    frown to her forehead.  After a moment she turned toward Jed
    Winslow.  Their eyes met and in his she saw the same startled hint
    of wonder, of possible trouble, she knew he must see in hers.  Then
    they both looked away.
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell prated proudly on, chanting praises of his
    daughter's capabilities and talents, as he did to any one who would
    listen, and varying the monotony with occasional references to the
    wonderful manner in which young Phillips had "taken hold" at the
    bank.  Ruth nodded and murmured something from time to time, but to
    any one less engrossed by his subject than the captain it would
    have been evident she was paying little attention.  Jed, who was
    being entertained by Babbie and Petunia, was absently pretending to
    be much interested in a fairy story which the former was
    improvising&#8212;she called the process "making up as I go along"&#8212;for
    his benefit.  Suddenly he leaned forward and spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Sam," he said, "there's somebody comin' up the walk.  I didn't get
    a good sight of him, but it ain't anybody that lives here in Orham
    regular."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  That so?" demanded the captain.  "How do you know 'tain't if
    you didn't see him?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause he's comin' to the front door," replied Mr. Winslow, with
    unanswerable logic.  "There he is now, comin' out from astern of
    that lilac bush.  Soldier, ain't he?"
</p>
<p>
    It was Ruth Armstrong who first recognized the visitor.  "Why," she
    exclaimed, "it is Major Grover, isn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    The major it was, and a moment later Captain Hunniwell ushered him
    into the room.  He had come to Orham on an errand, he explained,
    and had stopped at the windmill shop to see Mr. Winslow.  Finding
    the latter out, he had taken the liberty of following him to the
    Hunniwell home.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm going to stay but a moment, Captain Hunniwell," he went on.
    "I wanted to talk with Winslow on a&#8212;well, on a business matter.
    Of course I won't do it now but perhaps we can arrange a time
    convenient for us both when I can."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't cal'late there'll be much trouble about that," observed the
    captain, with a chuckle.  "Jed generally has time convenient for
    'most everybody; eh, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Um-hm," he drawled, "for everybody but Gab Bearse."
</p>
<p>
    "So you and Jed are goin' to talk business, eh?" queried Captain
    Sam, much amused at the idea.  "Figgerin' to have him rig up
    windmills to drive those flyin' machines of yours, Major?"
</p>
<p>
    "Not exactly.  My business was of another kind, and probably not
    very important, at that.  I shall probably be over here again on
    Monday, Winslow.  Can you see me then?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Ye-es," he said, "I'll be on private
    exhibition to my friends all day.  And children half price," he
    added, giving Babbie a hug.  "But say, Major, how in the world did
    you locate me to-day?  How did you know I was over here to Sam's?
    I never told you I was comin', I'll swear to that."
</p>
<p>
    For some reason or other Major Grover seemed just a little
    embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    "Why no," he said, stammering a trifle, "you didn't tell me, but
    some one did.  Now, who&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "I think I told you, Major," put in Ruth Armstrong.  "Last evening,
    when you called to&#8212;to return Charlie's umbrella.  I told you we
    were to dine here to-day and that Jed&#8212;Mr. Winslow&#8212;was to dine
    with us.  Don't you remember?"
</p>
<p>
    Grover remembered perfectly then, of course.  He hastened to
    explain that, having borrowed the umbrella of Charles Phillips the
    previous week, he had dropped in on his next visit to Orham to
    return it.
</p>
<p>
    Jed grunted.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" he said, "you never came to see me last night.  When you
    was as close aboard as next door seems's if you might."
</p>
<p>
    The major laughed.  "Well, you'll have to admit that I came to-
    day," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," put in Captain Sam, "and, now you are here, you're goin' to
    stay a spell.  Oh, yes, you are, too.  Uncle Sam don't need you so
    hard that he can't let you have an hour or so off on Thanksgiving
    Day.  Maud, why in time didn't we think to have Major Grover here
    for dinner along with the rest of the folks?  Say, couldn't you eat
    a plate of frozen puddin' right this minute?  We've got some on
    hand that tastes of my grandfather, and we want to get rid of it."
</p>
<p>
    Their caller laughingly declined the frozen pudding, but he was
    prevailed upon to remain and hear Miss Hunniwell play.  So Maud
    played and Charles turned the music for her, and Major Grover
    listened and talked with Ruth Armstrong in the intervals between
    selections.  And Jed and Barbara chatted and Captain Sam beamed
    good humor upon every one.  It was a very pleasant, happy
    afternoon.  War and suffering and heartache and trouble seemed a
    long, long way off.
</p>
<p>
    On the way back to the shop in the chill November dusk Grover told
    Jed a little of what he had called to discuss with him.  If Jed's
    mind had been of the super-critical type it might have deemed the
    subject of scarcely sufficient importance to warrant the major's
    pursuing him to the Hunniwells'.  It was simply the subject of
    Phineas Babbitt and the latter's anti-war utterances and surmised
    disloyalty.
</p>
<p>
    "You see," explained Grover, "some one evidently has reported the
    old chap to the authorities as a suspicious person.  The
    government, I imagine, isn't keen on sending a special investigator
    down here, so they have asked me to look into the matter.  I don't
    know much about Babbitt, but I thought you might.  Is he disloyal,
    do you think?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed hesitated.  Things the hardware dealer had said had been
    reported to him, of course; but gossip&#8212;particularly the Bearse
    brand of gossip&#8212;was not the most reliable of evidence.  Then he
    remembered his own recent conversation with Leander and the
    latter's expressed fear that his father might get into trouble.
    Jed determined, for the son's sake, not to bring that trouble
    nearer.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Major," he answered, "I shouldn't want to say that he was.
    Phineas talks awful foolish sometimes, but I shouldn't wonder if
    that was his hot head and bull temper as much as anything else.  As
    to whether he's anything more than foolish or not, course I
    couldn't say sartin, but I don't think he's too desperate to be
    runnin' loose.  I cal'late he won't put any bombs underneath the
    town hall or anything of that sort.  Phin and his kind remind me
    some of that new kind of balloon you was tellin' me they'd probably
    have over to your camp when 'twas done, that&#8212;er&#8212;er&#8212;dirigible;
    wasn't that what you called it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  But why does Babbitt remind you of a dirigible balloon?  I
    don't see the connection."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you?  Well, seems's if I did.  Phin fills himself up with
    the gas he gets from his Anarchist papers and magazines&#8212;the 'rich
    man's war' and all the rest of it&#8212;and goes up in the air and when
    he's up in the air he's kind of hard to handle.  That's what you
    told me about the balloon, if I recollect."
</p>
<p>
    Grover laughed heartily.  "Then the best thing to do is to keep him
    on the ground, I should say," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Um-hm," he drawled, "but shuttin' off his
    gas supply might help some.  I don't think I'd worry about him
    much, if I was you."
</p>
<p>
    They separated at the front gate before the shop, where the rows of
    empty posts, from which the mills and vanes had all been removed,
    stood as gaunt reminders of the vanished summer.  Major Grover
    refused Jed's invitation to come in and have a smoke.
</p>
<p>
    "No, thank you," he said, "not this evening.  I'll wait here a
    moment and say good-night to the Armstrongs and Phillips and then I
    must be on my way to the camp. . . .  Why, what's the matter?
    Anything wrong?"
</p>
<p>
    His companion was searching in his various pockets.  The search
    completed, he proceeded to look himself over, so to speak, taking
    off his hat and looking at that, lifting a hand and then a foot and
    looking at them, and all with a puzzled, far-away expression.  When
    Grover repeated his question he seemed to hear it for the first
    time and then not very clearly.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he drawled.  "Oh, why&#8212;er&#8212;yes, there IS somethin' wrong.
    That is to say, there ain't, and that's the wrong part of it.  I
    don't seem to have forgotten anything, that's the trouble."
</p>
<p>
    His friend burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
    "I should scarcely call that a trouble," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Shouldn't you?  No, I presume likely you wouldn't.  But I never go
    anywhere without forgettin' somethin', forgettin' to say somethin'
    or do somethin' or bring somethin'.  Never did in all my life.  Now
    here I am home again and I can't remember that I've forgot a single
    thing. . . .  Hum. . . .  Well, I declare!  I wonder what it means.
    Maybe, it's a sign somethin's goin' to happen."
</p>
<p>
    He said good night absent-mindedly.  Grover laughed and walked away
    to meet Ruth and her brother, who, with Barbara dancing ahead, were
    coming along the sidewalk.  He had gone but a little way when he
    heard Mr. Winslow shouting his name.
</p>
<p>
    "Major!" shouted Jed.  "Major Grover!  It's all right, Major, I
    feel better now.  I've found it.  'Twas the key.  I left it in the
    front door lock here when I went away this mornin'.  I guess
    there's nothin' unnatural about me, after all; guess nothin's goin'
    to happen."
</p>
<p>
    But something did and almost immediately.  Jed, entering the outer
    shop, closed the door and blundered on through that apartment and
    the little shop adjoining until he came to his living-room beyond.
    Then he fumbled about in the darkness for a lamp and matchbox.  He
    found the latter first, on the table where the lamp should have
    been.  Lighting one of the matches, he then found the lamp on a
    chair directly in front of the door, where he had put it before
    going away that morning, his idea in so doing being that it would
    thus be easier to locate when he returned at night.  Thanking his
    lucky stars that he had not upset both chair and lamp in his
    prowlings, Mr. Winslow lighted the latter.  Then, with it in his
    hand, he turned, to see the very man he and Major Grover had just
    been discussing seated in the rocker in the corner of the room and
    glaring at him malevolently.
</p>
<p>
    Naturally, Jed was surprised.  Naturally, also, being himself, he
    showed his surprise in his own peculiar way.  He did not start
    violently, nor utter an exclamation.  Instead he stood stock still,
    returning Phineas Babbitt's glare with a steady, unwinking gaze.
</p>
<p>
    It was the hardware dealer who spoke first.  And that, by the way,
    was precisely what he had not meant to do.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he observed, with caustic sarcasm, "it's me.  You needn't
    stand there blinkin' like a fool any longer, Shavin's.  It's me."
</p>
<p>
    Jed set the lamp upon the table.  He drew a long breath, apparently
    of relief.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, so 'tis," he said, solemnly.  "When I first saw you sittin'
    there, Phin, I had a suspicion 'twas you, but the longer I looked
    the more I thought 'twas the President come to call.  Do you know,"
    he added, confidentially, "if you didn't have any whiskers and he
    looked like you you'd be the very image of him."
</p>
<p>
    This interesting piece of information was not received with
    enthusiasm.  Mr. Babbitt's sense of humor was not acutely
    developed.
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind the funny business, Shavin's," he snapped.  "I didn't
    come here to be funny to-night.  Do you know why I came here to
    talk to you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed pulled forward a chair and sat down.
</p>
<p>
    "I presume likely you came here because you found the door
    unlocked, Phin," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "I didn't say HOW I came to come, but WHY I came.  I knew where you
    was this afternoon.  I see you when you left there and I had a good
    mind to cross over and say what I had to say before the whole crew,
    Sam Hunniwell, and his stuck-up rattle-head of a daughter, and that
    Armstrong bunch that think themselves so uppish, and all of 'em."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow stirred uneasily in his chair.  "Now, Phin," he
    protested, "seems to me&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But Babbitt was too excited to heed.  His little eyes snapped and
    his bristling beard quivered.
</p>
<p>
    "You hold your horses, Shavin's," he ordered.  "I didn't come here
    to listen to you.  I came because I had somethin' to say and when
    I've said it I'm goin' and goin' quick.  My boy's been home.  You
    knew that, I suppose, didn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Yes," he said, "I knew Leander'd come home for
    Thanksgivin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you did!  He came here to this shop to see you, maybe?  Humph!
    I'll bet he did, the poor fool!"
</p>
<p>
    Again Jed shifted his position.  His hands clasped about his knee
    and his foot lifted from the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "There, there, Phin," he said gently; "after all, he's your only
    son, you know."
</p>
<p>
    "I know it.  But he's a fool just the same."
</p>
<p>
    "Now, Phin!  The boy'll be goin' to war pretty soon, you know, and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt sprang to his feet.  His chin trembled so that he could
    scarcely speak.
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up!" he snarled.  "Don't let me hear you say that again, Jed
    Winslow.  Who sent him to war?  Who filled his head full of rubbish
    about patriotism, and duty to the country, and all the rest of the
    rotten Wall Street stuff?  Who put my boy up to enlistin', Jed
    Winslow?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's foot swung slowly back and forth.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Phin," he drawled, "to be real honest, I think he put
    himself up to it."
</p>
<p>
    "You're a liar.  YOU did it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "Did Leander tell you I did?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "No," mockingly, "Leander didn't tell me.  You and Sam Hunniwell
    and the rest of the gang have fixed him so he don't come to his
    father to tell things any longer.  But he told his step-mother this
    very mornin' and she told me.  You was the one that advised him to
    enlist, he said.  Good Lord; think of it!  He don't go to his own
    father for advice; he goes to the town jackass instead, the critter
    that spends his time whittlin' out young-one's playthings.  My Lord
    A'mighty!"
</p>
<p>
    He spat on the floor to emphasize his disgust.  There was an
    interval of silence before Jed answered.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, Phin," he said, slowly, "you're right, in a way.  Leander
    and I have always been pretty good friends and he's been in the
    habit of droppin' in here to talk things over with me.  When he
    came to me to ask what he ought to do about enlistin', asked what
    I'd do if I was he, I told him; that's all there was to it."
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt extended a shaking forefinger.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, and you told him to go to war.  Don't lie out of it now; you
    know you did."
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes . . . I did."
</p>
<p>
    "You did?  You DID?  And you have the cheek to own up to it right
    afore my face."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's hand stroked his chin.  "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "you just
    ordered me not to lie out of it, you know.  Leander asked me right
    up and down if I wouldn't enlist if I was in his position.
    Naturally, I said I would."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, you did.  And you knew all the time how I felt about it, you
    SNEAK."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's foot slowly sank to the floor and just as slowly he hoisted
    himself from the chair.
</p>
<p>
    "Phin," he said, with deliberate mildness, "is there anything else
    you'd like to ask me?  'Cause if there isn't, maybe you'd better
    run along."
</p>
<p>
    "You sneakin' coward!"
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;er&#8212;now&#8212;now, Phin, you didn't understand.  I said 'ask' me,
    not 'call' me."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I didn't come here to ask you anything.  I came here and
    waited here so's to be able to tell you somethin'.  And that is
    that I know now that you're responsible for my son&#8212;my only boy,
    the boy I'd depended on&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The fierce little man was, for the moment, close to breaking down.
    Jed's heart softened; he felt almost conscience-stricken.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sorry for you, Phineas," he said.  "I know how hard it must be
    for you.  Leander realized it, too.  He&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up!  Shavin's, you listen to me.  I don't forget.  All my
    life I've never forgot.  And I ain't never missed gettin' square.
    I can wait, just as I waited here in the dark over an hour so's to
    say this to you.  I'll get square with you just as I'll get square
    with Sam Hunniwell. . . .  That's all. . . .  That's all. . . .
    DAMN YOU!"
</p>
<p>
    He stamped from the room and Jed heard him stumbling through the
    littered darkness of the shops on his way to the front door,
    kicking at the obstacles he tripped over and swearing and sobbing
    as he went.  It was ridiculous enough, of course, but Jed did not
    feel like smiling.  The bitterness of the little man's final curse
    was not humorous.  Neither was the heartbreak in his tone when he
    spoke of his boy.  Jed felt no self-reproach; he had advised
    Leander just as he might have advised his own son had his life been
    like other men's lives, normal men who had married and possessed
    sons.  He had no sympathy for Phineas Babbitt's vindictive hatred
    of all those more fortunate than he or who opposed him, or for his
    silly and selfish ideas concerning the war.  But he did pity him;
    he pitied him profoundly.
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt had left the front door open in his emotional departure and
    Jed followed to close it.  Before doing so he stepped out into the
    yard.
</p>
<p>
    It was pitch dark now and still.  He could hear the footsteps of
    his recent visitor pounding up the road, and the splashy grumble of
    the surf on the bar was unusually audible.  He stood for a moment
    looking up at the black sky, with the few stars shining between the
    cloud blotches.  Then he turned and looked at the little house next
    door.
</p>
<p>
    The windows of the sitting-room were alight and the shades drawn.
    At one window he saw Charles Phillips' silhouette; he was reading,
    apparently.  Across the other shade Ruth's dainty profile came and
    went.  Jed looked and looked.  He saw her turn and speak to some
    one.  Then another shadow crossed the window, the shadow of Major
    Grover.  Evidently the major had not gone home at once as he had
    told Jed he intended doing, plainly he had been persuaded to enter
    the Armstrong house and make Charlie and his sister a short call.
    This was Jed's estimate of the situation, his sole speculation
    concerning it and its probabilities.
</p>
<p>
    And yet Mr. Gabe Bearse, had he seen the major's shadow upon the
    Armstrong window curtain, might have speculated much.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XV
</h2>
<p>
    The pity which Jed felt for Phineas Babbitt caused him to keep
    silent concerning his Thanksgiving evening interview with the
    hardware dealer.  At first he was inclined to tell Major Grover of
    Babbitt's expressions concerning the war and his son's enlistment.
    After reflection, however, he decided not to do so.  The Winslow
    charity was wide enough to cover a multitude of other people's sins
    and it covered those of Phineas.  The latter was to be pitied; as
    to fearing him, as a consequence of his threat to "get square," Jed
    never thought of such a thing.  If he felt any anxiety at all in
    the matter it was a trifling uneasiness because his friends, the
    Hunniwells and the Armstrongs, were included in the threat.  But he
    was inclined to consider Mr. Babbitt's wrath as he had once
    estimated the speech of a certain Ostable candidate for political
    office, to be "like a tumbler of plain sody water, mostly fizz and
    froth and nothin' very substantial or fillin'."  He did not tell
    Grover of the interview in the shop; he told no one, not even Ruth
    Armstrong.
</p>
<p>
    The&#8212;to him, at least&#8212;delightful friendship and intimacy between
    himself and his friends and tenants continued.  He and Charlie
    Phillips came to know each other better and better.  Charles was
    now almost as confidential concerning his personal affairs as his
    sister had been and continued to be.
</p>
<p>
    "It's surprising how I come in here and tell you all my private
    business, Jed," he said, laughing.  "I don't go about shouting my
    joys and troubles in everybody's ear like this.  Why do I do it to
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed stopped a dismal whistle in the middle of a bar.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "I don't know.  When I was a young-one I
    used to like to holler out back of Uncle Laban Ryder's barn so's to
    hear the echo.  When you say so and so, Charlie, I generally agree
    with you.  Maybe you come here to get an echo; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips laughed.  "You're not fair to yourself," he said.  "I
    generally find when the echo in here says no after I've said yes it
    pays me to pay attention to it.  Sis says the same thing about you,
    Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed made no comment, but his eyes shone.  Charles went on.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you get tired of hearing the story of my life?" he asked.
    "I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped short and the smile faded from his lips.  Jed knew why.
    The story of his life was just what he had not told, what he could
    not tell.
</p>
<p>
    As January slid icily into February Mr. Gabriel Bearse became an
    unusually busy person.  There were so many things to talk about.
    Among these was one morsel which Gabe rolled succulently beneath
    his tongue.  Charles Phillips, "'cordin' to everybody's tell," was
    keeping company with Maud Hunniwell.
</p>
<p>
    "There ain't no doubt of it," declared Mr. Bearse.  "All hands is
    talkin' about it.  Looks's if Cap'n Sam would have a son-in-law on
    his hands pretty soon.  How do you cal'late he'd like the idea,
    Shavin's?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed squinted along the edge of the board he was planing.  He made
    no reply.  Gabe tried again.
</p>
<p>
    "How do you cal'late Cap'n Sam'll like the notion of his pet
    daughter takin' up with another man?" he queried.  Jed was still
    mute.  His caller lost patience.
</p>
<p>
    "Say, what ails you?" he demanded.  "Can't you say nothin'?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow put down the board and took up another.
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es," he drawled.
</p>
<p>
    "Then why don't you, for thunder sakes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Um. . .  Oh, I did."
</p>
<p>
    "Did what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Say nothin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you divilish idiot!  Stop tryin' to be funny.  I asked you how
    you thought Cap'n Sam would take the notion of Maud's havin' a
    steady beau?  She's had a good many after her, but looks as if she
    was stuck on this one for keeps."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed and looked over his spectacles at Mr. Bearse.  The
    latter grew uneasy under the scrutiny.
</p>
<p>
    "What in time are you lookin' at me like that for?" he asked,
    pettishly.
</p>
<p>
    The windmill maker sighed again.  "Why&#8212;er&#8212;Gab," he drawled, "I
    was just thinkin' likely YOU might be stuck for keeps."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Stuck?  What are you talkin' about?"
</p>
<p>
    "Stuck on that box you're sittin' on.  I had the glue pot standin'
    on that box just afore you came in and . . . er . . . it leaks
    consider'ble."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Bearse raspingly separated his nether garment from the top of
    the box and departed, expressing profane opinions.  Jed's lips
    twitched for an instant, then he puckered them and began to
    whistle.
</p>
<p>
    But, although he had refused to discuss the matter with Gabriel
    Bearse, he realized that there was a strong element of probability
    in the latter's surmise.  It certainly did look as if the spoiled
    daughter of Orham's bank president had lost her heart to her
    father's newest employee.  Maud had had many admirers; some very
    earnest and lovelorn swains had hopefully climbed the Hunniwell
    front steps only to sorrowfully descend them again.  Miss Melissa
    Busteed and other local scandal scavengers had tartly classified
    the young lady as the "worst little flirt on the whole Cape," which
    was not true.  But Maud was pretty and vivacious and she was not
    averse to the society and adoration of the male sex in general,
    although she had never until now shown symptoms of preference for
    an individual.  But Charlie Phillips had come and seen and, judging
    by appearances, conquered.
</p>
<p>
    Since the Thanksgiving dinner the young man had been a frequent
    visitor at the Hunniwell home.  Maud was musical, she played well
    and had a pleasing voice.  Charles' baritone was unusually good.
    So on many evenings Captain Sam's front parlor rang with melody,
    while the captain smoked in the big rocker and listened admiringly
    and gazed dotingly.  At the moving-picture theater on Wednesday and
    Saturday evenings Orham nudged and winked when two Hunniwells and a
    Phillips came down the aisle.  Even at the Congregational church,
    where Maud sang in the choir, the young bank clerk was beginning to
    be a fairly constant attendant.  Captain Eri Hedge declared that
    that settled it.
</p>
<p>
    "When a young feller who ain't been to meetin' for land knows how
    long," observed Captain Eri, "all of a sudden begins showin' up
    every Sunday reg'lar as clockwork, you can make up your mind it's
    owin' to one of two reasons&#8212;either he's got religion or a girl.
    In this case there ain't any revival in town, so&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    And the captain waved his hand.
</p>
<p>
    Jed was not blind and he had seen, perhaps sooner than any one
    else, the possibilities in the case.  And what he saw distressed
    him greatly.  Captain Sam Hunniwell was his life-long friend.  Maud
    had been his pet since her babyhood; she and he had had many
    confidential chats together, over troubles at school, over petty
    disagreements with her father, over all sorts of minor troubles and
    joys.  Captain Sam had mentioned to him, more than once, the
    probability of his daughter's falling in love and marrying some
    time or other, but they both had treated the idea as vague and far
    off, almost as a joke.
</p>
<p>
    And now it was no longer far off, the falling in love at least.
    And as for its being a joke&#8212;Jed shuddered at the thought.  He was
    very fond of Charlie Phillips; he had made up his mind at first to
    like him because he was Ruth's brother, but now he liked him for
    himself.  And, had things been other than as they were, he could
    think of no one to whom he had rather see Maud Hunniwell married.
    In fact, had Captain Hunniwell known the young man's record, of his
    slip and its punishment, Jed would have been quite content to see
    the latter become Maud's husband.  A term in prison, especially
    when, as in this case, he believed it to be an unwarranted
    punishment, would have counted for nothing in the unworldly mind of
    the windmill maker.  But Captain Sam did not know.  He was
    tremendously proud of his daughter; in his estimation no man would
    have been quite good enough for her.  What would he say when he
    learned?  What would Maud say when she learned? for it was almost
    certain that Charles had not told her.  These were some of the
    questions which weighed upon the simple soul of Jedidah Edgar
    Wilfred Winslow.
</p>
<p>
    And heavier still there weighed the thought of Ruth Armstrong.  He
    had given her his word not to mention her brother's secret to a
    soul, not even to him.  And yet, some day or other, as sure and
    certain as the daily flowing and ebbing of the tides, that secret
    would become known.  Some day Captain Sam Hunniwell would learn it;
    some day Maud would learn it.  Better, far better, that they
    learned it before marriage, or even before the public announcement
    of their engagement&#8212;always provided there was to be such an
    engagement.  In fact, were it not for Ruth herself, no
    consideration for Charles' feelings would have prevented Jed's
    taking the matter up with the young man and warning him that,
    unless he made a clean breast to the captain and Maud, he&#8212;Jed&#8212;
    would do it for him.  The happiness of two such friends should not
    be jeopardized if he could prevent it.
</p>
<p>
    But there was Ruth.  She, not her brother, was primarily
    responsible for obtaining for him the bank position and obtaining
    it under fake pretenses.  And she, according to her own confession
    to Jed, had urged upon Charles the importance of telling no one.
    Jed himself would have known nothing, would have had only a vague,
    indefinite suspicion, had she not taken him into her confidence.
    And to him that confidence was precious, sacred.  If Charlie's
    secret became known, it was not he alone who would suffer; Ruth,
    too, would be disgraced.  She and Babbie might have to leave Orham,
    might have to go out of his life forever.
</p>
<p>
    No wonder that, as the days passed, and Gabe Bearse's comments and
    those of Captain Eri Hedge were echoed and reasserted by the
    majority of Orham tongues, Jed Winslow's worry and foreboding
    increased.  He watched Charlie Phillips go whistling out of the
    yard after supper, and sighed as he saw him turn up the road in the
    direction of the Hunniwell home.  He watched Maud's face when he
    met her and, although the young lady was in better spirits and
    prettier than he had ever seen her, these very facts made him
    miserable, because he accepted them as proofs that the situation
    was as he feared.  He watched Ruth's face also and there, too, he
    saw, or fancied that he saw, a growing anxiety.  She had been very
    well; her spirits, like Maud's, had been light; she had seemed
    younger and so much happier than when he and she first met.  The
    little Winslow house was no longer so quiet, with no sound of
    voices except those of Barbara and her mother.  There were Red
    Cross sewing meetings there occasionally, and callers came.  Major
    Grover was one of the latter.  The major's errands in Orham were
    more numerous than they had been, and his trips thither much more
    frequent, in consequence.  And whenever he came he made it a point
    to drop in, usually at the windmill shop first, and then upon
    Babbie at the house.  Sometimes he brought her home from school in
    his car.  He told Jed that he had taken a great fancy to the little
    girl and could not bear to miss an opportunity of seeing her.
    Which statement Jed, of course, accepted wholeheartedly.
</p>
<p>
    But Jed was sure that Ruth had been anxious and troubled of late
    and he believed the reason to be that which troubled him.  He hoped
    she might speak to him concerning her brother.  He would have liked
    to broach the subject himself, but feared she might consider him
    interfering.
</p>
<p>
    One day&#8212;it was in late February, the ground was covered with snow
    and a keen wind was blowing in over a sea gray-green and splashed
    thickly with white&#8212;Jed was busy at his turning lathe when Charlie
    came into the shop.  Business at the bank was not heavy in mid-
    winter and, although it was but little after three, the young man
    was through work for the day.  He hoisted himself to his accustomed
    seat on the edge of the workbench and sat there, swinging his feet
    and watching his companion turn out the heads and trunks of a batch
    of wooden sailors.  He was unusually silent, for him, merely
    nodding in response to Jed's cheerful "Hello!" and speaking but a
    few words in reply to a question concerning the weather.  Jed,
    absorbed in his work and droning a hymn, apparently forgot all
    about his caller.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly the latter spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he said, "when you are undecided about doing or not doing a
    thing, how do you settle it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he asked.  "What's that?"
</p>
<p>
    "I say when you have a decision to make and your mind is about
    fifty-fifty on the subject, how do you decide?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's answer was absently given.  "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "I
    generally&#8212;er&#8212;don't."
</p>
<p>
    "But suppose the time comes when you have to, what then?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, then, if 'tain't very important I usually leave it
    to Isaiah."
</p>
<p>
    "Isaiah?  Isaiah who?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know his last name, but he's got a whole lot of first
    ones.  That's him, up on that shelf."
</p>
<p>
    He pointed to a much battered wooden figure attached to the edge of
    the shelf upon the wall.  The figure was that of a little man
    holding a set of mill arms in front of him.  The said mill arms
    were painted a robin's-egg blue, and one was tipped with black.
</p>
<p>
    "That's Isaiah," continued Jed.  "Hum . . . yes . . . that's him.
    He was the first one of his kind of contraption that I ever made
    and, bein' as he seemed to bring me luck, I've kept him.  He's
    settled a good many questions for me, Isaiah has."
</p>
<p>
    "Why do you call him Isaiah?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, that's just his to-day's name.  I called him Isaiah just
    now 'cause that was the first of the prophet names I could think
    of.  Next time he's just as liable to be Hosea or Ezekiel or Samuel
    or Jeremiah.  He prophesies just as well under any one of 'em,
    don't seem to be particular."
</p>
<p>
    Charles smiled slightly&#8212;he did not appear to be in a laughing
    mood&#8212;and then asked: "You say he settles questions for you?  How?"
</p>
<p>
    "How? . . .  Oh. . .  Well, you notice one end of that whirligig
    arm he's got is smudged with black?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "That's Hosea's indicator.  Suppose I've got somethin' on&#8212;on what
    complimentary folks like you would call my mind.  Suppose, same as
    'twas yesterday mornin', I was tryin' to decide whether or not I'd
    have a piece of steak for supper.  I gave&#8212;er&#8212;Elisha's whirlagig
    here a spin and when the black end stopped 'twas p'intin' straight
    up.  That meant yes.  If it had p'inted down, 'twould have meant no."
</p>
<p>
    "Suppose it had pointed across&#8212;half way between yes and no?"
</p>
<p>
    "That would have meant that&#8212;er&#8212;what's-his-name&#8212;er&#8212;Deuteronomy
    there didn't know any more than I did about it."
</p>
<p>
    This time Phillips did laugh.  "So you had the steak," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    Jed's lip twitched.  "I bought it," he drawled.  "I got so far all
    accordin' to prophecy.  And I put it on a plate out in the back
    room where 'twas cold, intendin' to cook it when supper time came."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, didn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o; you see, 'twas otherwise provided.  That everlastin' Cherub
    tomcat of Taylor's must have sneaked in with the boy when he
    brought the order from the store.  When I shut the steak up in the
    back room I&#8212;er&#8212;er&#8212;hum. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "You did what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, I shut the cat up with it.  I guess likely that's
    the end of the yarn, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Pretty nearly, I should say.  What did you do to the cat?"
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . . Why, I let him go.  He's a good enough cat, 'cordin' to
    his lights, I guess.  It must have been a treat to him; I doubt if
    he gets much steak at home. . . .  Well, do you want to give Isaiah
    a whirl on that decision you say you've got to make?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles gave him a quick glance.  "I didn't say I had one to make,"
    he replied.  "I asked how you settled such a question, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    "Um. . . .  I see. . . .  I see.  Well, the prophet's at your
    disposal.  Help yourself."
</p>
<p>
    The young fellow shook his head.  "I'm afraid it wouldn't be very
    satisfactory," he said.  "He might say no when I wanted him to say
    yes, you see."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm. . . .  He's liable to do that.  When he does it to me I
    keep on spinnin' him till we agree, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips made no comment on this illuminating statement and there
    was another interval of silence, broken only by the hum and rasp of
    the turning lathe.  Then he spoke again.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he said, "seriously now, when a big question comes up to
    you, and you've got to answer it one way or the other, how do you
    settle with yourself which way to answer?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "That's easy, Charlie," he declared.  "There don't any
    big questions ever come up to me.  I ain't the kind of feller the
    big things come to."
</p>
<p>
    Charles grunted, impatiently.  "Oh, well, admitting all that," he
    said, "you must have to face questions that are big to you, that
    seem big, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed could not help wincing, just a little.  The matter-of-fact way
    in which his companion accepted the estimate of his insignificance
    was humiliating.  Jed did not blame him, it was true, of course,
    but the truth hurt&#8212;a little.  He was ashamed of himself for
    feeling the hurt.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh," he drawled, "I do have some things&#8212;little no-account things&#8212;
    to decide every once in a while.  Sometimes they bother me, too&#8212;
    although they probably wouldn't anybody with a head instead of a
    Hubbard squash on his shoulders.  The only way I can decide 'em is
    to set down and open court, put 'em on trial, as you might say."
</p>
<p>
    "What do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, I call in witnesses for both sides, seems so.  Here's the
    reasons why I ought to tell; here's the reasons why I shouldn't.
    I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Tell?  Ought to TELL?  What makes you say that?  What have YOU got
    to tell?"
</p>
<p>
    He was glaring at the windmill maker with frightened eyes.  Jed
    knew as well as if it had been painted on the shop wall before him
    the question in the boy's mind, the momentous decision he was
    trying to make.  And he pitied him from the bottom of his heart.
</p>
<p>
    "Tell?" he repeated.  "Did I say tell?  Well, if I did 'twas just
    a&#8212;er&#8212;figger of speech, as the book fellers talk about.  But the
    only way to decide a thing, as it seems to me, is to try and figger
    out what's the RIGHT of it, and then do that."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips looked gloomily at the floor.  "And that's such an easy
    job," he observed, with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
    "The figgerin' or the doin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, the doing; the figuring is usually easy enough&#8212;too easy.  But
    the doing is different.  The average fellow is afraid.  I don't
    suppose you would be, Jed.  I can imagine you doing almost anything
    if you thought it was right, and hang the consequences."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked aghast.  "Who?  Me?" he queried.  "Good land of love,
    don't talk that way, Charlie!  I'm the scarest critter that lives
    and the weakest-kneed, too, 'most generally.  But&#8212;but, all the
    same, I do believe the best thing, and the easiest in the end, not
    only for you&#8212;or me&#8212;but for all hands, is to take the bull by the
    horns and heave the critter, if you can.  There may be an awful big
    trouble, but big or little it'll be over and done with.  THAT bull
    won't be hangin' around all your life and sneakin' up astern to get
    you&#8212;and those you&#8212;er&#8212;care for. . . .  Mercy me, how I do preach!
    They'll be callin' me to the Baptist pulpit, if I don't look out.
    I understand they're candidatin'."
</p>
<p>
    His friend drew a long breath.  "There is a poem that I used to
    read, or hear some one read," he observed, "that fills the bill for
    any one with your point of view, I should say.  Something about a
    fellow's not being afraid to put all his money on one horse, or the
    last card&#8212;about his not deserving anything if he isn't afraid to
    risk everything.  Wish I could remember it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up from the lathe.
</p>
<pre>     "'He either fears his fate too much,
         Or his deserts are small,
       Who dares not put it to the touch
         To win or lose it all.'
</pre>
<p>
    That's somethin' like it, ain't it, Charlie?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    Phillips was amazed.  "Well, I declare, Winslow," he exclaimed,
    "you beat me!  I can't place you at all.  Whoever would have
    accused you of reading poetry&#8212;and quoting it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "I don't know much, of course," he said, "but
    there's consider'ble many poetry books up to the library and I like
    to read 'em sometimes.  You're liable to run across a&#8212;er&#8212;poem&#8212;
    well, like this one, for instance&#8212;that kind of gets hold of you.
    It fills the bill, you might say, as nothin' else does.  There's
    another one that's better still.  About&#8212;
</p>
<pre>     'Once to every man and nation
           Comes the moment to decide.
</pre>
<p>
    Do you know that one?"
</p>
<p>
    His visitor did not answer.  After a moment he swung himself from
    the workbench and turned toward the door.
</p>
<p>
    "'He either fears his fate too much,'" he quoted, gloomily.
    "Humph!  I wonder if it ever occurred to that chap that there might
    be certain kinds of fate that COULDN'T be feared too much? . . .
    Well, so long, Jed.  Ah hum, you don't know where I can get hold of
    some money, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was surprised.  "Humph!" he grunted.  "I should say you HAD
    hold of money two-thirds of every day.  Feller that works in a bank
    is supposed to handle some cash."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, of course," with an impatient laugh, "but that is somebody
    else's money, not mine.  I want to get some of my own."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho! . . .  Well, I cal'late I could let you have ten or twenty
    dollars right now, if that would be any help to you."
</p>
<p>
    "It wouldn't; thank you just the same.  If it was five hundred
    instead of ten, why&#8212;perhaps I shouldn't say no."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was startled.
</p>
<p>
    "Five hundred?" he repeated.  "Five hundred dollars?  Do you need
    all that so very bad, Charlie?"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips, his foot upon the threshold of the outer shop, turned and
    looked at him.
</p>
<p>
    "The way I feel now I'd do almost anything to get it," he said, and
    went out.
</p>
<p>
    Jed told no one of this conversation, although his friend's parting
    remark troubled and puzzled him.  In fact it troubled him so much
    that at a subsequent meeting with Charles he hinted to the latter
    that he should be glad to lend the five hundred himself.
</p>
<p>
    "I ought to have that and some more in the bank," he said.  "Sam
    would know whether I had or not. . . .  Eh?  Why, and you would,
    too, of course.  I forgot you know as much about folks' bank
    accounts as anybody. . . .  More'n some of 'em do themselves,
    bashfulness stoppin' me from namin' any names," he added.
</p>
<p>
    Charles looked at him.  "Do you mean to tell me, Jed Winslow," he
    said, "that you would lend me five hundred dollars without any
    security or without knowing in the least what I wanted it for?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, of course.  'Twouldn't be any of my business what you
    wanted it for, would it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  Have you done much lending of that kind?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Um. . . .  Well, I used to do consider'ble, but Sam he
    kind of put his foot down and said I shouldn't do any more.  But I
    don't HAVE to mind him, you know, although I generally do because
    it's easier&#8212;and less noisy," he added, with a twinkle in his eye.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, you ought to mind him; he's dead right, of course.  You're a
    good fellow, Jed, but you need a guardian."
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head sadly.  "I hate to be so unpolite as to call
    your attention to it," he drawled, "but I've heard somethin' like
    that afore.  Up to now I ain't found any guardian that needs me,
    that's the trouble.  And if I want to lend you five hundred
    dollars, Charlie, I'm goin' to.  Oh, I'm a divil of a feller when I
    set out to be, desperate and reckless, I am."
</p>
<p>
    Charlie laughed, but he put his hand on Jed's shoulder, "You're a
    brick, I know that," he said, "and I'm a million times obliged to
    you.  But I was only joking; I don't need any five hundred."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  You don't? . . .  Why, you said&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I&#8212;er&#8212;need some new clothes and things and I was talking
    foolishness, that's all.  Don't you worry about me, Jed; I'm all
    right."
</p>
<p>
    But Jed did worry, a little, although his worry concerning the
    young man's need of money was so far overshadowed by the anxiety
    caused by his falling in love with Maud Hunniwell that it was
    almost forgotten.  That situation was still as tense as ever.  Two-
    thirds of Orham, so it seemed to Jed, was talking about it,
    wondering when the engagement would be announced and speculating,
    as Gabe Bearse had done, on Captain Sam's reception of the news.
    The principals, Maud and Charles, did not speak of it, of course&#8212;
    neither did the captain or Ruth Armstrong.  Jed expected Ruth to
    speak; he was certain she understood the situation and realized its
    danger; she appeared to him anxious and very nervous.  It was to
    him, and to him alone&#8212;her brother excepted&#8212;she could speak, but
    the days passed and she did not.  And it was Captain Hunniwell who
    spoke first.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XVI
</h2>
<p>
    Captain Sam entered the windmill shop about two o'clock one windy
    afternoon in the first week of March.  He was wearing a heavy fur
    overcoat and a motoring cap.  He pulled off the coat, threw it over
    a pile of boards and sat down.
</p>
<p>
    "Whew!" he exclaimed.  "It's blowing hard enough to start the bark
    on a log."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up.
</p>
<p>
    "Did you say log or dog?" he asked, solemnly.
</p>
<p>
    The captain grinned.  "I said log," he answered.  "This gale of
    wind would blow a dog away, bark and all.  Whew!  I'm all out of
    breath.  It's some consider'ble of a drive over from Wapatomac.
    Comin' across that stretch of marsh road by West Ostable I didn't
    know but the little flivver would turn herself into a flyin'-
    machine and go up."
</p>
<p>
    Jed stopped in the middle of the first note of a hymn.
</p>
<p>
    "What in the world sent you autoin' way over to Wapatomac and back
    this day?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    His friend bit the end from a cigar.  "Oh, diggin' up the root of
    all evil," he said.  "I had to collect a note that was due over
    there."
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  I don't know much about such things, but I never
    mistrusted 'twas necessary for you to go cruisin' like that to
    collect notes.  Seems consider'ble like sendin' the skipper up town
    to buy onions for the cook.  Couldn't the&#8212;the feller that owed the
    money send you a check?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam chuckled.  "He could, I cal'late, but he wouldn't," he
    observed.  "'Twas old Sylvester Sage, up to South Wapatomac, the
    'cranberry king' they call him up there.  He owns cranberry bogs
    from one end of the Cape to the other.  You've heard of him, of
    course."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Maybe so," he drawled, "but if I have I've
    forgot him.  The only sage I recollect is the sage tea Mother used
    to make me take when I had a cold sometimes.  I COULDN'T forget
    that."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, everybody but you has heard of old Sylvester.  He's the
    biggest crank on earth."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum-m.  Seems 's if he and I ought to know each other. . . .  But
    maybe he's a different kind of crank; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "He's all kinds.  One of his notions is that he won't pay bills by
    check, if he can possibly help it.  He'll travel fifty miles to pay
    money for a thing sooner than send a check for it.  He had this
    note&#8212;fourteen hundred dollars 'twas&#8212;comin' due at our bank to-day
    and he'd sent word if we wanted the cash we must send for it 'cause
    his lumbago was too bad for him to travel.  I wanted to see him
    anyhow, about a little matter of a political appointment up his
    way, so I decided to take the car and go myself.  Well, I've just
    got back and I had a windy v'yage, too.  And cold, don't talk!"
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes. . . .  Get your money, did you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I got it.  It's in my overcoat pocket now.  I thought one
    spell I wasn't goin' to get it, for the old feller was mad about
    some one of his cranberry buyers failin' up on him and he was as
    cross-grained as a scrub oak root.  He and I had a regular row over
    the matter of politics I went there to see him about 'special.  I
    told him what he was and he told me where I could go.  That's how
    we parted.  Then I came home."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . .  You'd have had a warmer trip if you'd gone where he
    sent you, I presume likely. . . .  Um. . . .  Yes, yes. . . .
</p>
<pre>     'There's a place in this chorus
        For you and for me,
      And the theme of it ever
        And always shall be:
      Hallelujah, 'tis do-ne!
        I believe. . . .'
</pre>
<p>
    Hum! . . .  I thought that paint can was full and there ain't
    more'n a half pint in it.  I must have drunk it in my sleep, I
    guess.  Do I look green around the mouth, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    It was just before Captain Sam's departure that he spoke of his
    daughter and young Phillips.  He mentioned them in a most casual
    fashion, as he was putting on his coat to go, but Jed had a feeling
    that his friend had stopped at the windmill shop on purpose to
    discuss that very subject and that all the detail of his Wapatomac
    trip had been in the nature of a subterfuge to conceal this fact.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh," said the captain, with somewhat elaborate carelessness, as he
    struggled into the heavy coat, "I don't know as I told you that the
    directors voted to raise Charlie's salary.  Um-hm, at last
    Saturday's meetin' they did it.  'Twas unanimous, too.  He's as
    smart as a whip, that young chap.  We all think a heap of him."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, but made no comment.  The captain fidgeted with a
    button of his coat.  He turned toward the door, stopped, cleared
    his throat, hesitated, and then turned back again.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he said, "has&#8212;has it seemed to you that&#8212;that he&#8212;that
    Charlie was&#8212;maybe&#8212;comin' to think consider'ble of&#8212;of my
    daughter&#8212;of Maud?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up, caught his eye, and looked down again.  Captain Sam
    sighed.
</p>
<p>
    "I see," he said.  "You don't need to answer.  I presume likely the
    whole town has been talkin' about it for land knows how long.  It's
    generally the folks at home that don't notice till the last gun
    fires.  Of course I knew he was comin' to the house a good deal and
    that he and Maud seemed to like each other's society, and all that.
    But it never struck me that&#8212;that it meant anything serious, you
    know&#8212;anything&#8212;anything&#8212;well, you know what I mean, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Yes, Sam, I suppose I do."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Well, I&#8212;I don't know why it never struck me, either.  If
    Georgianna&#8212;if my wife had been alive, she'd have noticed, I'll
    bet, but I didn't.  'Twas only last evenin'; when he came to get
    her to go to the pictures, that it came across me, you might say,
    like&#8212;like a wet, cold rope's end' slappin' me in the face.  I give
    you my word, Jed, I&#8212;I kind of shivered all over.  She means&#8212;she
    means somethin' to me, that little girl and&#8212;and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He seemed to find it hard to go on.  Jed leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
    "I know, Sam, I know," he said.  His friend nodded.
</p>
<p>
    "I know you do, Jed," he said.  "I don't think there's anybody else
    knows so well.  I'm glad I've got you to talk to.  I cal'late,
    though," he added, with a short laugh, "if some folks knew I came
    here to&#8212;to talk over my private affairs they'd think I was goin'
    soft in the head."
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled, and there was no resentment in the smile.
</p>
<p>
    "They'd locate the softness in t'other head of the two, Sam," he
    suggested.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't care where they locate it.  I can talk to you about things
    I never mention to other folks.  Guess it must be because you&#8212;you&#8212;
    well, I don't know, but it's so, anyhow. . . .  Well, to go ahead,
    after the young folks had gone I sat there alone in the parlor, in
    the dark, tryin' to think it out.  The housekeeper had gone over to
    her brother's, so I had the place to myself.  I thought and thought
    and the harder I thought the lonesomer the rest of my life began to
    look.  And yet&#8212;and yet I kept tellin' myself how selfish and
    foolish that was.  I knew 'twas a dead sartinty she'd be gettin'
    married some time.  You and I have laughed about it and joked about
    it time and again.  And I've joked about it with her, too.  But&#8212;
    but jokin's one thing and this was another. . . .  Whew!"
</p>
<p>
    He drew a hand across his forehead.  Jed did not speak.  After a
    moment the captain went on.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he said, "when she got home, and after he'd gone, I got
    Maud to sit on my knee, same as she's done ever since she was a
    little girl, and she and I had a talk.  I kind of led up to the
    subject, as you might say, and by and by we&#8212;well, we talked it out
    pretty straight.  She thinks an awful sight of him, Jed.  There
    ain't any doubt about that, she as much as told me in those words,
    and more than told me in other ways.  And he's the only one she's
    ever cared two straws for, she told me that.  And&#8212;and&#8212;well, I
    think she thinks he cares for her that way, too, although of course
    she didn't say so.  But he hasn't spoken to her yet.  I don't know,
    but&#8212;but it seemed to me, maybe, that he might be waitin' to speak
    to me first.  I'm his&#8212;er&#8212;boss, you know, and perhaps he may feel
    a little&#8212;little under obligations to me in a business way and that
    might make it harder for him to speak.  Don't it seem to you maybe
    that might be it, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Poor Jed hesitated.  Then he stammered that he shouldn't be
    surprised.  Captain Sam sighed.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he said, "if that's it, it does him credit, anyhow.  I
    ain't goin' to be selfish in this thing, Jed.  If she's goin' to
    have a husband&#8212;and she is, of course&#8212;I cal'late I'd rather 'twas
    Charlie than anybody else I've ever run across.  He's smart and
    he'll climb pretty high, I cal'late.  Our little single-sticked
    bankin' craft ain't goin' to be big enough for him to sail in very
    long.  I can see that already.  He'll be navigatin' a clipper one
    of these days.  Well, that's the way I'd want it.  I'm pretty
    ambitious for that girl of mine and I shouldn't be satisfied short
    of a top-notcher.  And he's a GOOD feller, Jed; a straight, clean,
    honest and above-board young chap.  That's the best of it, after
    all, ain't it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's reply was almost a groan, but his friend did not notice.  He
    put on his overcoat and turned to go.
</p>
<p>
    "So, there you are," he said.  "I had to talk to somebody, had to
    get it off my chest, and, as I just said, it seems to be easier to
    talk such things to you than anybody else.  Now if any of the town
    gas engines&#8212;Gab Bearse or anybody else&#8212;comes cruisin' in here
    heavin' overboard questions about how I like the notion of Maud and
    Charlie takin' up with each other, you can tell 'em I'm tickled to
    death.  That won't be all lie, neither.  I can't say I'm happy,
    exactly, but Maud is and I'm goin' to make-believe be, for her
    sake.  So long."
</p>
<p>
    He went out.  Jed put his elbows on the workbench and covered his
    face with his hands.  He was still in that position when Ruth
    Armstrong came in.  He rose hastily, but she motioned him to sit
    again.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she said, "Captain Hunniwell was just here with you; I saw
    him go.  Tell me, what was he talking about?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was confused.  "Why&#8212;why, Mrs. Ruth," he stammered, "he was
    just talkin' about&#8212;about a note he'd been collectin', and&#8212;and
    such."
</p>
<p>
    "Wasn't he speaking of his daughter&#8212;and&#8212;and my brother?"
</p>
<p>
    This time Jed actually gasped.  Ruth drew a long breath.  "I knew
    it," she said.
</p>
<p>
    "But&#8212;but, for mercy sakes, HOW did you know?  Did he&#8212;?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, he didn't see me at all.  I was watching him from the window.
    But I saw his face and&#8212;" with a sudden gesture of desperation,
    "Oh, it wasn't that at all, Jed.  It was my guilty conscience, I
    guess.  I've been expecting him to speak to you&#8212;or me&#8212;have been
    dreading it every day&#8212;and now somehow I knew he had spoken.  I
    KNEW it.  What did he say, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed told the substance of what Captain Sam had said.  She listened.
    When he finished her eyes were wet.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, it is dreadful," she moaned.  "I&#8212;I was so hoping she might
    not care for Charlie.  But she does&#8212;of course she does.  She
    couldn't help it," with a sudden odd little flash of loyalty.
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin in desperation.
</p>
<p>
    "And&#8212;and Charlie?" he asked, anxiously.  "Does he&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, yes, I'm sure he does.  He has never told me so, never in so
    many words, but I can see.  I know him better than any one else in
    the world and I can see.  I saw first, I think, on Thanksgiving
    Day; at least that is when I first began to suspect&#8212;to fear."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "When they was at the piano together that time and Sam
    said somethin' about their bein' a fine-lookin' couple?" he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes, that was it.  Are you a mind reader, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o, I guess not.  But I saw you lookin' kind of surprised and&#8212;
    er&#8212;well, scared for a minute.  I was feelin' the same way just
    then, so it didn't need any mind reader to guess what had scared
    you."
</p>
<p>
    "I see.  But, oh, Jed, it is dreadful!  What SHALL we do?  What
    will become of us all?  And now, when I&#8212;I had just begun to be
    happy, really happy."
</p>
<p>
    She caught her breath in a sob.  Jed instinctively stretched out
    his hand.
</p>
<p>
    "But there," she went on, hurriedly wiping her eyes, "I mustn't do
    this.  This is no time for me to think of myself.  Jed, this
    mustn't go any further.  He must not ask her to marry him; he must
    not think of such a thing."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sadly shook his head.  "I'm afraid you're right," he said.
    "Not as things are now he surely mustn't.  But&#8212;but, Mrs. Ruth&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, don't!" impatiently.  "Don't use that silly 'Mrs.' any longer.
    Aren't you the&#8212;the best friend I have in the world?  Do call me
    Ruth."
</p>
<p>
    If she had been looking at his face just then she might have seen&#8212;
    things.  But she was not looking.  There was an interval of silence
    before he spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, then&#8212;er&#8212;Ruth&#8212;" he faltered.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right.  Go on."
</p>
<p>
    "I was just goin' to ask you if you thought Charlie was cal'latin'
    to ask her.  I ain't so sure that he is."
</p>
<p>
    He told of Charles' recent visit to the windmill shop and the young
    man's query concerning the making of a decision.  She listened
    anxiously.
</p>
<p>
    "But don't you think that means that he was wondering whether or
    not he should ask her?" she said.
</p>
<p>
    "No.  That is, I don't think it's sartin sure it means that.  I
    rather had the notion it might mean he was figgerin' whether or not
    to go straight to Sam and make a clean breast of it."
</p>
<p>
    "You mean tell&#8212;tell everything?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, all about the&#8212;the business at Middleford.  I do honestly
    believe that's what the boy's got on his mind to do.  It ain't very
    surprisin' that he backs and fills some before that mind's made up.
    See what it might mean to him: it might mean the loss of his
    prospects here and his place in the bank and, more'n everything
    else, losin' Maud.  It's some decision to make.  If I had to make
    it I&#8212;  Well, I don't know."
</p>
<p>
    She put her hand to her eyes.  "The POOR boy," she said, under her
    breath.  "But, Jed, DO you think that is the decision he referred
    to?  And why hasn't he said a word to me, his own sister, about it?
    I'm sure he loves me."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin he does, and that's just it, as I see it.  It ain't his own
    hopes and prospects alone that are all wrapped up in this thing,
    it's yours&#8212;and Babbie's.  He's troubled about what'll happen to
    you.  That's why he hasn't asked your advice, I believe."
</p>
<p>
    They were both silent for a moment.  Then she said, pleadingly,
    "Oh, Jed, it is up to you and me, isn't it?  What shall we do?"
</p>
<p>
    It was the "we" in this sentence which thrilled.  If she had bade
    him put his neck in front of the handsaw just then Jed would have
    obeyed, and smilingly have pulled the lever which set the machine
    in motion.  But the question, nevertheless, was a staggerer.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he admitted, "I&#8212;I hardly know what to say, I will give
    in.  To be right down honest&#8212;and the Lord knows I hate to say it&#8212;
    it wouldn't do for a minute to let those two young folks get
    engaged&#8212;to say nothin' of gettin' married&#8212;with this thing between
    'em.  It wouldn't be fair to her, nor to Sam&#8212;no, nor to him or
    you, either.  You see that, don't you?" he begged.  "You know I
    don't say it for any reason but just&#8212;just for the best interests
    of all hands.  You know that, don't you&#8212;Ruth?"
</p>
<p>
    "Of course, of course.  But what then?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't really know what then.  Seems to me the very first thing
    would be for you to speak to him, put the question right up to him,
    same as he's been puttin' it to himself all this time.  Get him to
    talk it over with you.  And then&#8212;well, then&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't know!  I declare I don't."
</p>
<p>
    "Suppose he tells me he means to marry her in spite of everything?
    Suppose he won't listen to me at all?"
</p>
<p>
    That possibility had been in Jed's mind from the beginning, but he
    refused to consider it.
</p>
<p>
    "He will listen," he declared, stoutly.  "He always has, hasn't he?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, yes, I suppose he has.  He listened to me when I persuaded
    him that coming here and hiding all&#8212;all that happened was the
    right thing to do.  And now see what has come of it!  And it is all
    my fault.  Oh, I have been so selfish!"
</p>
<p>
    "Sshh! sshh!  You ain't; you couldn't be if you tried.  And,
    besides, I was as much to blame as you.  I agreed that 'twas the
    best thing to do."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh," reproachfully, "how can you say that?  You know you were
    opposed to it always.  You only say it because you think it will
    comfort me.  It isn't true."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Now&#8212;now, don't talk so.  Please don't.  If you keep on
    talkin' that way I'll do somethin' desperate, start to make a
    johnny cake out of sawdust, same as I did yesterday mornin', or
    somethin' else crazy."
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!"
</p>
<p>
    "It's true, that about the johnny cake.  I came pretty nigh doin'
    that very thing.  I bought a five-pound bag of corn meal yesterday
    and fetched it home from the store all done up in a nice neat
    bundle.  Comin' through the shop here I had it under my arm, and&#8212;
    hum&#8212;er&#8212;well, to anybody else it couldn't have happened, but,
    bein' Jed Shavin's Winslow, I was luggin' the thing with the top of
    the bag underneath.  I got about abreast of the lathe there when
    the string came off and in less'n two thirds of a shake all I had
    under my arm was the bag; the meal was on the floor&#8212;what wasn't in
    my coat pocket and stuck to my clothes and so on.  I fetched the
    water bucket and started to salvage what I could of the cargo.
    Pretty soon I had, as nigh as I could reckon it, about fourteen
    pound out of the five scooped up and in the bucket.  I begun to
    think the miracle of loaves and fishes was comin' to pass again.  I
    was some shy on fish, but I was makin' up on loaves.  Then I sort
    of looked matters over and found what I had in the bucket was about
    one pound of meal to seven of sawdust.  Then I gave it up.  Seemed
    to me the stuff might be more fillin' than nourishin'."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth smiled faintly.  Then she shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed," she said, "you're as transparent as a windowpane.  Thank
    you, though.  If anything could cheer me up and help me to forget I
    think you could."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked repentant.  "I'd no business to tell you all that
    rigamarole," he said.  "I'm sorry.  I'm always doin' the wrong
    thing, seems so.  But," he added, earnestly, "I don't want you to
    worry too much about your brother&#8212;er&#8212;Ruth.  It's goin' to come
    out all right, I know it.  God won't let it come out any other
    way."
</p>
<p>
    She had never heard him speak in just that way before and she
    looked at him in surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "And yet God permits many things that seem entirely wrong to us
    humans," she said.
</p>
<p>
    "I know.  Things like the Kaiser, for instance.  Well, never mind;
    this one's goin' to come out all right.  I feel it in my bones.
    And," with a return of his whimsical drawl, "I may be short on
    brains, but a blind man could see they never skimped me when they
    passed out the bones."
</p>
<p>
    She looked at him a moment.  Then, suddenly leaning forward, she
    put her hand upon his big red one as it lay upon the bench.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she said, earnestly, "what should I do without you?  You are
    my one present help in time of trouble.  I wonder if you know what
    you have come to mean to me."
</p>
<p>
    It was an impulsive speech, made from the heart, and without
    thought of phrasing or that any meaning other than that intended
    could be read into it.  A moment later, and without waiting for an
    answer, she hurried from the shop.
</p>
<p>
    "I must go," she said.  "I shall think over your advice, Jed, and I
    will let you know what I decide to do.  Thank you ever and ever so
    much."
</p>
<p>
    Jed scarcely heard her.  After she had gone, he sat perfectly still
    by the bench for a long period, gazing absently at the bare wall of
    the shop and thinking strange thoughts.  After a time he rose and,
    walking into the little sitting-room, sat down beside the ugly
    little oak writing table he had bought at a second-hand sale and
    opened the upper drawer.
</p>
<p>
    Weeks before, Ruth, yielding to Babbie's urgent appeal, had
    accompanied the latter to the studio of the local photographer and
    there they had been photographed, together, and separately.  The
    results, although not artistic triumphs, being most inexpensive,
    had been rather successful as likenesses.  Babbie had come trotting
    in to show Jed the proofs.  A day or so later he found one of the
    said proofs on the shop floor where the little girl had dropped it.
    It happened to be a photograph of Ruth, sitting alone.
</p>
<p>
    And then Jed Winslow did what was perhaps the first dishonest thing
    he had ever done.  He put that proof in the drawer of the oak
    writing table and said nothing of his having found it.  Later he
    made a wooden frame for it and covered it with glass.  It faded and
    turned black as all proofs do, but still Jed kept it in the drawer
    and often, very often, opened that drawer and looked at it.  Now he
    looked at it for a long, long time and when he rose to go back to
    the shop there was in his mind, along with the dream that had been
    there for days and weeks, for the first time the faintest dawning
    of a hope.  Ruth's impulsive speech, hastily and unthinkingly made,
    was repeating itself over and over in his brain.  "I wonder if you
    know what you have come to mean to me?"  What had he come to mean
    to her?
</p>
<p>
    An hour later, as he sat at his bench, Captain Hunniwell came
    banging in once more.  But this time the captain looked troubled.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he asked, anxiously, "have you found anything here since I
    went out?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked up.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he asked, absently.  "Found?  What have you found, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "I?  I haven't found anything.  I've lost four hundred dollars,
    though.  You haven't found it, have you?"
</p>
<p>
    Still Jed did not appear to comprehend.  He had been wandering the
    rose-bordered paths of fairyland and was not eager to come back to
    earth.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he drawled.  "You've&#8212;what?"
</p>
<p>
    His friend's peppery temper broke loose.
</p>
<p>
    "For thunder sakes wake up!" he roared.  "I tell you I've lost four
    hundred dollars of the fourteen hundred I told you I collected from
    Sylvester Sage over to Wapatomac this mornin'.  I had three
    packages of bills, two of five hundred dollars each and one of four
    hundred.  The two five hundred packages were in the inside pocket
    of my overcoat where I put 'em.  But the four hundred one's gone.
    What I want to know is, did it drop out when I took off my coat
    here in the shop?  Do you get that through your head, finally?"
</p>
<p>
    It had gotten through.  Jed now looked as troubled as his friend.
    He rose hastily and went over to the pile of boards upon which
    Captain Sam had thrown his coat upon entering the shop on his
    previous visit that day.  Together they searched, painstakingly and
    at length.  The captain was the first to give up.
</p>
<p>
    "'Tain't here," he snapped.  "I didn't think 'twas.  Where in time
    is it?  That's what I want to know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you sure you had it when you left Wapatomac?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Sure?  No, I ain't sure of anything.  But I'd have sworn I did.
    The money was on the table along with my hat and gloves.  I picked
    it up and shoved it in my overcoat pocket.  And that was a darned
    careless place to put it, too," he added, testily.  "I'd have given
    any feller that worked for me the devil for doin' such a thing."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded, sympathetically.  "But you might have left it there to
    Sylvester's," he said.  "Have you thought of telephonin' to find
    out?"
</p>
<p>
    "Have I thought?  Tut, tut, tut!  Do you think I've got a head like
    a six-year-old young-one&#8212;or you?  Course I've thought&#8212;and
    'phoned, too.  But it didn't do me any good.  Sylvester's house is
    shut up and the old man's gone to Boston, so the postmaster told me
    when I 'phoned and asked him.  Won't be back for a couple of days,
    anyhow.  I remember he told me he was goin'!"
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho! that's too bad."
</p>
<p>
    "Bad enough, but I don't think it makes any real difference.  I
    swear I had that money when I left Sage's.  I came in here and then
    I went straight to the bank."
</p>
<p>
    "And after you got there?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, when I got there I found no less than three men, not countin'
    old Mrs. Emmeline Bartlett, in my room waitin' to see me.  Nellie
    Hall&#8212;my typewriter, you know&#8212;she knew where I'd been and what a
    crank old Sage is and she says: 'Did you get the money, Cap'n?'
    And I says: 'Yes, it's in my overcoat pocket this minute.'  Then I
    hurried in to 'tend to the folks that was waitin' for me.  'Twas an
    hour later afore I went to my coat to get the cash.  Then, as I
    say, all I could find was the two five hundred packages.  The four
    hundred one was gone."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho!  Tut, tut, tut!  Where did you put the coat when you
    took it off?"
</p>
<p>
    "On the hook in the clothes closet where I always put it."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum-m!  And&#8212;er&#8212;when you told Nellie about it did you speak
    loud?"
</p>
<p>
    "Loud?  No louder'n I ever do."
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;er&#8212;that ain't a&#8212;er&#8212;whisper, Sam, exactly."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't make any difference.  There wasn't anybody outside the
    railin' that minute to hear if I'd bellered like a bull of Bashan.
    There was nobody in the bank, I tell you, except the three men and
    old Aunt Emmeline and they were waitin' in my private room.  And
    except for Nellie and Eddie Ellis, the messenger, and Charlie
    Phillips, there wan't a soul around, as it happened.  The money
    hasn't been stolen; I lost it somewheres&#8212;but where?  Well, I can't
    stop here any longer.  I'm goin' back to the bank to have another
    hunt."
</p>
<p>
    He banged out again.  Fortunately he did not look at his friend's
    face before he went.  For that face had a singular expression upon
    it.  Jed sat heavily down in the chair by the bench.  A vivid
    recollection of a recent remark made in that very shop had suddenly
    come to him.  Charlie Phillips had made it in answer to a question
    of his own.  Charlie had declared that he would do almost anything
    to get five hundred dollars.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XVII
</h2>
<p>
    The next morning found Jed heavy-eyed and without appetite, going
    through the form of preparing breakfast.  All night, with the
    exception of an hour or two, he had tossed on his bed alternately
    fearing the worst and telling himself that his fears were
    groundless.  Of course Charlie Phillips had not stolen the four
    hundred dollars.  Had not he, Jed Winslow, loudly proclaimed to
    Ruth Armstrong that he knew her brother to be a fine young man, one
    who had been imprudent, it is true, but much more sinned against
    than sinning and who would henceforth, so he was willing to swear,
    be absolutely upright and honest?  Of course the fact that a sum of
    money was missing from the Orham National Bank, where Phillips was
    employed, did not necessarily imply that the latter had taken it.
</p>
<p>
    Not necessarily, that was true; but Charlie had, in Jed's presence,
    expressed himself as needing money, a sum approximately that which
    was missing; and he had added that he would do almost anything to
    get it.  And&#8212;there was no use telling oneself that the fact had no
    bearing on the case, because it would bear heavily with any
    unprejudiced person&#8212;Charlie's record was against him.  Jed loyally
    told himself over and over again that the boy was innocent, he KNEW
    he was innocent.  But&#8212;  The dreadful "but" came back again and
    again to torment him.
</p>
<p>
    All that day he went about in an alternate state of dread and hope.
    Hope that the missing four hundred might be found, dread of&#8212;many
    possibilities.  Twice he stopped at the bank to ask Captain Sam
    concerning it.  The second time the captain was a trifle impatient.
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king, Jed," he snapped.  "What's the matter with you?
    'Tain't a million.  This institution'll probably keep afloat even
    if it never turns up.  And 'twill turn up sooner or later; it's
    bound to.  There's a chance that I left it at old Sage's.  Soon's
    the old cuss gets back and I can catch him by telephone I'll find
    out.  Meanwhile I ain't worryin' and I don't know why you should.
    The main thing is not to let anybody know anything's missin'.  Once
    let the news get out 'twill grow to a hundred thousand afore night.
    There'll be a run on us if Gab Bearse or Melissa Busteed get goin'
    with their throttles open.  So don't you whisper a word to anybody,
    Jed.  We'll find it pretty soon."
</p>
<p>
    And Jed did not whisper a word.  But he anxiously watched the
    inmates of the little house, watched Charles' face when he came
    home after working hours, watched the face of his sister as she
    went forth on a marketing expedition, even scrutinized Babbie's
    laughing countenance as she came dancing into the shop, swinging
    Petunia by one arm.  And it was from Babbie he first learned that,
    in spite of all Captain Hunniwell's precautions, some one had
    dropped a hint.  It may as well be recorded here that the identity
    of that some one was never clearly established.  There were
    suspicions, centering about the bank messenger, but he stoutly
    denied having told a living soul.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara, who was on her way home from school, and had rescued the
    long-suffering Petunia from the front fence where she had been left
    suspended on a picket to await her parent's return, was bubbling
    over with news and giggles.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Uncle Jed," she demanded, jumping up to perch panting upon a
    stack of the front elevations of birdhouses, "isn't Mr. Gabe Bearse
    awfully funny?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "Yes," he said, "Gabe's as funny as a jumpin'
    toothache."
</p>
<p>
    The young lady regarded him doubtfully.  "I see," she said, after a
    moment, "you're joking again.  I wish you'd tell me when you're
    going to do it, so Petunia and I would know for sure."
</p>
<p>
    "All right, I'll try not to forget to remember.  But how did you
    guess I was jokin' this time?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause you just had to be.  A jumping toothache isn't funny.  I
    had one once and it made me almost sick."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  W-e-e-ll, Gabe Bearse makes 'most everybody sick.  What
    set you thinkin' about him?"
</p>
<p>
    "'Cause I just met him on the way home and he acted so funny.
    First he gave me a stick of candy."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow leaned back in his chair.
</p>
<p>
    "What?" he cried.  "He gave you a stick of candy?  GAVE it to you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  He said: 'Here, little girl, don't you like candy?'  And
    when I said I did he gave me a stick, the striped peppermint kind
    it was.  I'd have saved a bite for you, Uncle Jed, only I and the
    rest ate it all before I remembered.  I'm awfully sorry."
</p>
<p>
    "That's all right.  Striped candy don't agree with me very well,
    anyway; I'm liable to swallow the stripes crossways, I guess
    likely.  But tell me, did Gabe look wild or out of his head when he
    gave it to you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, no.  He just looked&#8212;oh&#8212;oh, you know, Uncle Jed&#8212;MYSter'ous&#8212;
    that's how he looked, MYSter'ous."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum!  Well, I'm glad to know he wan't crazy.  I've known him a
    good many years and this is the first time I ever knew him to GIVE
    anybody anything worth while.  When I went to school with him he
    gave me the measles, I remember, but even then they was only
    imitation&#8212;the German kind.  And now he's givin' away candy: Tut,
    tut!  No wonder he looked&#8212;what was it?&#8212;mysterious. . . .  Hum. . . .
    Well, he wanted somethin' for it, didn't he?  What was it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, he just wanted to know if I'd heard Uncle Charlie say
    anything about a lot of money being gone up to the bank.  He said
    he had heard it was ever and ever so much&#8212;a hundred hundred
    dollars&#8212;or a thousand dollars, or something&#8212;I don't precactly
    remember, but it was a great, big lot.  And he wanted to know if
    Uncle Charlie had said how much it was and what had become of it
    and&#8212;and everything.  When I said Uncle Charlie hadn't said a word
    he looked so sort of disappointed and funny that it made me laugh."
</p>
<p>
    It did not make Jed laugh.  The thought that the knowledge of the
    missing money had leaked out and was being industriously spread
    abroad by Bearse and his like was very disquieting.  He watched
    Phillips more closely than before.  He watched Ruth, and, before
    another day had passed, he had devised a wonderful plan, a plan to
    be carried out in case of alarming eventualities.
</p>
<p>
    On the afternoon of the third day he sat before his workbench, his
    knee clasped between his hands, his foot swinging, and his thoughts
    busy with the situation in all its alarming phases.  It had been
    bad enough before this new development, bad enough when the always
    present danger of Phillips' secret being discovered had become
    complicated by his falling in love with his employer's daughter.
    But now&#8212;  Suppose the boy had stolen the money?  Suppose he was
    being blackmailed by some one whom he must pay or face exposure?
    Jed had read of such things; they happened often enough in novels.
</p>
<p>
    He did not hear the door of the outer shop open.  A month or more
    ago he had removed the bell from the door.  His excuse for so doing
    had been characteristic.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't stand the wear and tear on my morals," he told Ruth.  "I
    ain't sold anything, except through the mail, since the winter
    really set in.  And yet every time that bell rings I find myself
    jumpin' up and runnin' to wait on a customer.  When it turns out to
    be Gabe Bearse or somebody like him I swear, and swearin' to me is
    like whiskey to some folks&#8212;comfortin' but demoralizin'."
</p>
<p>
    So the bell having been removed, Jed did not hear the person who
    came into and through the outer shop.  The first sign of that
    person's presence which reached his ears was an unpleasant chuckle.
    He turned, to see Mr. Phineas Babbitt standing in the doorway of
    the inner room.  And&#8212;this was the most annoying and disturbing
    fact connected with the sight&#8212;the hardware dealer was not
    scowling, he was laughing.  The Winslow foot fell to the floor with
    a thump and its owner sat up straight.
</p>
<p>
    "He, he, he!" chuckled Phineas.  Jed regarded him silently.
    Babbitt's chuckle subsided into a grin.  Then he spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he observed, with sarcastic politeness, "how's the great
    Shavin's Jedidah, the famous inventor of whirlagigs?  He, he, he!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed slowly shook his head.  "Phin," he said, "either you wear
    rubbers or I'm gettin' deaf, one or the other.  How in the world
    did you get in here this time without my hearin' you?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas ignored the question.  He asked one of his own.  "How's the
    only original high and mighty patriot this afternoon?" he sneered.
</p>
<p>
    The Winslow hand caressed the Winslow chin.
</p>
<p>
    "If you mean me, Phin," drawled Jed, "I'm able to sit up and take
    nourishment, thank you.  I judge you must be kind of ailin',
    though.  Take a seat, won't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I won't.  I've got other fish to fry, bigger fish than you, at
    that"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Well, they wouldn't have to be sperm whales to beat me,
    Phin.  Be kind of hard to fry 'em if they was too big, wouldn't
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    "They're goin' to fry, you hear me.  Yes, and they're goin' to
    sizzle.  He, he, he!"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow sadly shook his head.  "You must be awful sick, Phin,"
    he drawled.  "That's the third or fourth time you've laughed since
    you came in here."
</p>
<p>
    His visitor stopped chuckling and scowled instead.  Jed beamed
    gratification.
</p>
<p>
    "That's it," he said.  "Now you look more natural.  Feelin' a
    little better . . . eh?"
</p>
<p>
    The Babbitt chin beard bristled.  Its wearer leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up," he commanded.  "I ain't takin' any of your sass this
    afternoon, Shavin's, and I ain't cal'latin' to waste much time on
    you, neither.  You know where I'm bound now?  Well, I'm bound up to
    the Orham National Bank to call on my dear friend Sam Hunniwell.
    He, he, he!  I've got a little bit of news for him.  He's in
    trouble, they tell me, and I want to help him out. . . .  Blast
    him!"
</p>
<p>
    This time Jed made no reply; but he, too, leaned forward and his
    gaze was fixed upon the hardware dealer's face.  There was an
    expression upon his own face which, when Phineas saw it, caused the
    latter to chuckle once more.
</p>
<p>
    "He, he!" he laughed.  "What's the matter, Shavin's?  You look kind
    of scared about somethin'.  'Tain't possible you've known all along
    what I've just found out?  I wonder if you have.  Have you?"
</p>
<p>
    Still Jed was silent.  Babbit grunted.
</p>
<p>
    "It don't make any difference whether you have or not," he said.
    "But if you ain't I wonder what makes you look so scared.  There's
    nothin' to be scared about, as I see.  I'm just cal'latin' to do
    our dear old chummie, Cap'n Sam, a kindness, that's all.  He's lost
    some money up there to the bank, I understand.  Some says it's four
    thousand dollars and some says it's forty.  It don't make any
    difference, that part don't.  Whatever 'tis it's missin' and I'm
    going to tell him where to find it.  That's real good of me, ain't
    it?  Ain't it, Shavin's; eh?"
</p>
<p>
    The little man's malignant spite and evident triumph were actually
    frightening.  And it was quite evident that Jed was frightened.
    Yet he made an effort not to appear so.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he agreed.  "Yes, yes, seems 's if 'twas.  Er&#8212;er&#8212;  Where
    is it, Phin?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas burst out laughing.  "'Where is it, Phin?'" he repeated,
    mockingly.  "By godfreys mighty, I believe you do know where 'tis,
    Shavin's!  You ain't gettin' any of it, are you?  You ain't
    dividin' up with the blasted jailbird?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was very pale.  His voice shook as he essayed to speak.
</p>
<p>
    "Wh-what jailbird?" he faltered.  "What do you mean?  What&#8212;what
    are you talkin' about, Phin?"
</p>
<p>
    "'What are you talkin' about, Phin?'  God sakes, hear him, will
    you!  All right, I'll tell you what I'm talkin' about.  I'm talkin'
    about Sam Hunniwell's pet, his new bookkeeper up there to the bank.
    I'm talkin' about that stuck-up, thievin' hypocrite of a Charlie
    Phillips, that's who I'm talkin' about.  I called him a jailbird,
    didn't I?  Well, he is.  He's served his term in the Connecticut
    State's prison for stealin'.  And I know it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed groaned aloud.  Here it was at last.  The single hair had
    parted and the sword had fallen.  And now, of all times, now!  He
    made a pitiful attempt at denial.
</p>
<p>
    "It ain't so," he protested.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, yes, it is so.  Six or eight weeks ago&#8212;in January 'twas&#8212;
    there was a drummer in my store sellin' a line of tools and he was
    lookin' out of the window when this Phillips cuss went by with Maud
    Hunniwell, both of 'em struttin' along as if common folks, honest
    folks, was dirt under their feet.  And when this drummer see 'em he
    swore right out loud.  'Why,' says he, 'that's Charlie Phillips, of
    Middleford, ain't it?'  'His name's Phillips and he comes from
    Connecticut somewheres,' says I.  'I thought he was in state's
    prison,' says he.  'What do you mean?' says I.  And then he told
    me.  'By godfreys,' says I, 'if you can fix it so's I can prove
    that's true I'll give you the biggest order you ever got in this
    store.'  ''Twon't be any trouble to prove it,' says he.  'All
    you've got to do is look up his record in Middleford.'  And I've
    looked it up.  Yes, sir-ee, I've looked it up.  Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, white and shaking, made one more attempt.
</p>
<p>
    "It's all a lie," he cried.  "Of course it is.  Besides, if you
    knew so much why have you been waitin' all this time before you
    told it?  If you found out all this&#8212;this pack of rubbish in
    January why did you wait till March before you told it?  Humph!
    That's pretty thin, I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas interrupted.
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up!" he ordered.  "Why did I wait?  Well, now, Shavin's,
    seein' it's you and I love you so, I'll tell you.  At first I was
    for runnin' right out in the street and hollerin' to all hands to
    come and hear the good news about Sam Hunniwell's pet.  And then
    thinks I: 'Hold on! don't be in any hurry.  There's time enough.
    Just wait and see what happens.  A crook that steals once is liable
    to try it again.  Let's wait and see.'  And I waited, and&#8212;  He,
    he, he!&#8212;he has tried it again.  Eh, Shavin's?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was speechless.  Babbitt, looking like a triumphantly vicious
    Bantam rooster, crowed on.
</p>
<p>
    "You don't seem to be quite so sassy and talky as you was when I
    first came in, Shavin's," he sneered.  "Guess likely YOU ain't
    feelin' well now . . . eh?  Do you remember what I told you last
    time I was in this shop?  I told you I'd pay my debts to you and
    Sam Hunniwell if I waited fifty year.  Well, here's Hunniwell's pay
    comin' to him now.  He's praised that Phillips thief from one end
    of Ostable county to the other, told how smart he was and how
    honest and good he was till&#8212;Lord A'mighty, it's enough to turn a
    decent man's stomach!  And not only that, but here's the feller
    courtin' his daughter.  Oh, ho, ho, ho! that's the best of the
    whole business.  That was another thing made me hang off and wait;
    I wanted to see how the courtin' came along.  And it's come along
    all right.  Everybody's onto 'em, hangin' over each other, and
    lookin' soft at each other.  She's just fairly heavin' herself at
    his head, all hands says so.  There ain't been anybody in this town
    good enough for her till he showed up.  And now it's comin' out
    that he's a crook and a jailbird!  And he'll be jailed for stealin'
    THIS time, too.  Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped, out of breath, to indulge in another long chuckle.  Jed
    leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
    "What are you talkin' about, Phin?" he demanded.  "Even allowin'
    all this&#8212;this rigmarole of yours about&#8212;about Middleford business&#8212;
    was true&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "It is true and you know it is.  I believe you've known it all
    along."
</p>
<p>
    "I say allowin' it is, you haven't any right to say Charlie took
    this money from the Orham bank.  You can't prove any such thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Aw, be still!  Prove&#8212;prove nothin'.  When a cat and a sasser of
    milk's shut up together and the milk's gone, you don't need proof
    to know where it's gone, do you?  Don't talk to me about proof, Jed
    Winslow.  Put a thief alongside of money and anybody knows what'll
    happen.  Why, YOU know what's happened yourself.  You know darn
    well Charlie Phillips has stole the money that's gone from the
    bank.  Down inside you you're sartin sure of it; and I don't want
    any better proof of THAT than just your face, Shavin's."
</p>
<p>
    This time Jed did not attempt to contradict.  Instead he tried a
    new hazard.
</p>
<p>
    "Phin," he pleaded, "don't be too hard.  Just think of what'll
    happen if you come out with that&#8212;that wild-goose yarn of yours.
    Think of Maud, poor girl.  You haven't got anything against her,
    have you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I have.  She's stuck-up and nose in the air and looks at me
    as if I was some sort of&#8212;of a bug she wouldn't want to step on for
    fear of mussin' up her shoes.  I never did like her, blast her.
    But leavin' that all to one side, she's Sam Hunniwell's young-one
    and that's enough for me."
</p>
<p>
    "But she's his only child, Phin."
</p>
<p>
    "Good enough!  I had a boy; he was an only child, too, you'll
    remember.  Where is he now?  Out somewheres where he don't belong,
    fightin' and bein' killed to help Wall Street get rich.  And who
    sent him there?  Why, Sam Hunniwell and his gang.  You're one of
    'em, Jed Winslow.  To hell with you, every one of you, daughters
    and all hands."
</p>
<p>
    "But, Phin&#8212;just a minute.  Think of what it'll mean to Charlie,
    poor young feller.  It'll mean&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "It'll mean ten years this time, and a good job, too.  You poor
    fool, do you think you can talk me out of this?  You, you sawdust-
    head?  What do you think I came into your hole here for?  I came
    here so's you'd know what I was goin' to do to your precious chums.
    I wanted to tell you and have the fun of watchin' you squirm.
    Well, I'm havin' the fun, plenty of it.  Squirm, you Wall Street
    bloodsucker, squirm."
</p>
<p>
    He fairly stood on tiptoe to scream the last command.  To a
    disinterested observer the scene might have had some elements of
    farce comedy.  Certainly Phineas, his hat fallen off and under
    foot, his scanty gray hair tousled and his pugnacious chin beard
    bristling, was funny to look at.  And the idea of calling Jed
    Winslow a "Wall Street bloodsucker" was the cream of burlesque.
    But to Jed himself it was all tragedy, deep and dreadful.  He made
    one more desperate plea.
</p>
<p>
    "But, Phin," he begged, "think of his&#8212;his sister, Charlie's
    sister.  What'll become of her and&#8212;and her little girl?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas snorted.  "His sister," he sneered.  "All right, I'll think
    about her all right.  She's another stuck-up that don't speak to
    common folks.  Who knows anything about her any more'n they did
    about him?  Better look up her record, I guess.  The boy's turned
    out to be a thief; maybe the sister'll turn out to be&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Stop!  Be still!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed actually shouted it.  Babbitt stopped, principally because the
    suddenness of the interruption had startled him into doing so.  But
    the pause was only momentary.  He stared at the interrupter in
    enraged amazement for an instant and then demanded: "Stop?  Who are
    you tellin' to stop?"
</p>
<p>
    "You."
</p>
<p>
    "I want to know!  Well, I'll stop when I get good and ready and if
    you don't like it, Shavin's, you can lump it.  That Phillips kid
    has turned out to be a thief and, so far as anybody 'round here
    knows, his sister may be&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Stop!"  Again Jed shouted it; and this time he rose to his feet.
    Phineas glared at him.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" he grunted.  "You'll make me stop, I presume likely."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "Is that so?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it's got to be so.  Look here, Phin, I realize you're mad and
    don't care much what you say, but there's a limit, you know.  It's
    bad enough to hear you call poor Charlie names, but when you start
    in on Ruth&#8212;on Mrs. Armstrong, I mean&#8212;that's too much.  You've got
    to stop."
</p>
<p>
    This speech was made quietly and with all the customary Winslow
    deliberation and apparent calm, but there was one little slip in it
    and that slip Babbitt was quick to notice.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, my!" he sneered.  "Ruth's what we call her, eh?  Ruth!  Got so
    chummy we call each other by our first names.  Ruthie and Jeddie, I
    presume likely.  Aw, haw, haw!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's pallor was, for the moment, succeeded by a vivid crimson.  He
    stammered.  Phineas burst into another scornful laugh.
</p>
<p>
    "Haw, haw, haw!" he crowed.  "She lets him call her Ruth.  Oh, my
    Lord A'mighty!  Let's Shavin's Winslow call her that.  Well, I
    guess I sized her up all right.  She must be about on her brother's
    level.  A thief and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up, Phin!"
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up?  YOU tell me to shut up!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I won't.  Ruth Armstrong!  What do I care for&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The speech was not finished.  Jed had taken one long stride to
    where Babbitt was standing, seized the furious little creature by
    the right arm with one hand and with the other covered his open
    mouth, covered not only the mouth, but a large section of face as
    well.
</p>
<p>
    "You keep quiet, Phin," he drawled.  "I want to think."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas struggled frantically.  He managed to get one corner of his
    mouth from behind that mammoth hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Ruth Armstrong!" he screamed.  "Ruth Armstrong is&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The yell died away to a gurgle, pinched short by the Winslow
    fingers.  Then the door leading to the kitchen, the door behind the
    pair, opened and Ruth Armstrong herself came in.  She was pale and
    she stared with frightened eyes at the little man struggling in the
    tall one's clutch.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed," she breathed, "what is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not reply.  Phineas could not.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed, what is it?" repeated Ruth.  "I heard him shouting my
    name.  I was in the yard and I heard it. . . .  Oh, Jed, what IS
    it?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt at last managed to wriggle partially clear.  He was crazy
    with rage, but he was not frightened.  Fear of physical violence
    was not in his make-up; he was no coward.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll tell you what it is," he screamed.  "I'll tell you what it
    is:  I've found out about you and that stuck-up crook of a brother
    of yours.  He's a thief.  That's what he is, a thief and a
    jailbird.  He stole at Middleford and now he's stole again here.
    And Jed Winslow and you are&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He got no further, being once more stoppered like a bottle by the
    Winslow grip and the Winslow hand.  He wriggled and fought, but he
    was pinned and helpless, hands, feet and vocal organs.  Jed did not
    so much as look at him; he looked only at Ruth.
</p>
<p>
    Her pallor had increased.  She was trembling.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed," she cried, "what does he mean?  What does he mean by&#8212;by
    'again&#8212;here'?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's grip tightened over his captive's mouth.
</p>
<p>
    "He doesn't mean anything," he declared, stoutly.  "He don't know
    what he means."
</p>
<p>
    From behind the smothering fingers came a defiant mumble.  Ruth
    leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she begged, "does he&#8212;does he know about&#8212;about&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  She closed her eyes and swayed slightly, but she did
    not collapse or give way.
</p>
<a name="ILLUS_292"><!-- Illustration - page 292 of book --></a>
<img src="shavings_files/page292.gif" width="395" height="624" border="0" alt="Illustration: &quot;And he is going to tell?&quot; she whispered">
<p>
    "And he is going to tell?" she whispered.
</p>
<p>
    A furious mumble from behind the fingers and a venomous flash from
    the Babbitt eyes were answers sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed," she pleaded, "what SHALL we do?"
</p>
<p>
    For the instant a bit of the old Jed came to the surface.  His lip
    twitched grimly as he looked down at the crimson face above his own
    hand.
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't sartin&#8212;yet," he drawled.  "How do you start in killin'
    a&#8212;a snappin' turtle?  I ain't tackled the job since I was a boy."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas looked as if he could have furnished some points on the
    subject.  His eyes were bulging.  Then all three heard the door of
    the outer shop open.
</p>
<p>
    Ruth looked desperately about her.  She hastened to the door by
    which she had entered.  "There's some one coming," she whispered.
</p>
<p>
    Jed glanced over his shoulder.  "You go away," he whispered in
    reply.  "Go away, Ruth.  Hurry!"
</p>
<p>
    Her hand was on the latch of the door, but before she could open it
    the other door, that leading from the outer shop, opened and
    Leonard Grover came in.  He stared at the picture before him&#8212;at
    Ruth Armstrong's pale, frightened face, at Babbitt struggling in
    his captor's clutch, at Jed.
</p>
<p>
    "Why!" he exclaimed.  "What is it?"
</p>
<p>
    No one answered.  Phineas was the only one who stirred.  He seemed
    anxious to turn the tableau into a moving picture, but his success
    was limited.  The Major turned to Ruth.
</p>
<p>
    "What is it?" he asked again.
</p>
<p>
    She was silent.  Grover repeated his question, addressing Jed this
    time.
</p>
<p>
    "Well?" he asked, sharply.  "What is the trouble here?  What has
    that fellow been doing?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked down at his wriggling captive.  "He's&#8212;he's&#8212;" he
    stammered.  "Well, you see, Major, he . . .  Hum . . . well, I'm
    afraid I can't tell you."
</p>
<p>
    "You can't tell me!  What on earth&#8212;  Mrs. Armstrong, will you tell
    me?"
</p>
<p>
    She looked at him appealingly, pitifully, but she shook her head.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I can't," she said.
</p>
<p>
    He looked from one to the other.  Then, with a shrug, he turned to
    the door.
</p>
<p>
    "Pardon me for interrupting," he observed.  "Good afternoon."
</p>
<p>
    It was Ruth who detained him.  "Oh, please!" she cried, involuntarily.
    He turned again.
</p>
<p>
    "You wish me to stay?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh&#8212;oh, I don't know.  I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She had not finished the sentence; she was falteringly trying to
    finish it when Mr. Babbitt took the center of the stage.  Once more
    he managed to free himself from Jed's grip and this time he darted
    across the shop and put the workbench between himself and his enemy.
</p>
<p>
    "I'll tell you what it is," he screamed.  "I've found out some
    things they don't want anybody to know, that's what.  I've found
    out what sort of folks they are, she and her brother.  He's a
    common&#8212;  Let go of me!  By&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The scream ended in another mumble.  Jed had swarmed over the bench
    and once more pinned him fast.
</p>
<p>
    "You'll have to excuse me, Major," he panted.  "I&#8212;I can't help it.
    This feller's got what ailed the parrot&#8212;he talks too darn much.
    He's got to stop!  He's GOT to!"
</p>
<p>
    But Grover was paying little attention.  He was looking at Ruth.
</p>
<p>
    "Mrs. Armstrong," he asked, "has he been saying&#8212;saying things he
    should not say about you?  Is that the trouble?"
</p>
<p>
    She answered without returning his look.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," she said, almost in a whisper.  "About me and&#8212;and my&#8212;
    Yes, that was it."
</p>
<p>
    The Major's eyes flashed.  "Let go of him, Jed," he commanded.  Jed
    hesitated.
</p>
<p>
    "If I do he'll blow up again," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Let go of him."
</p>
<p>
    Jed let go.  Phineas caught his breath and opened his mouth.  Major
    Grover stepped in front of him and leveled a forefinger straight at
    the crimson Babbitt nose.
</p>
<p>
    "Stop!" he ordered, sharply.
</p>
<p>
    "Stop?  What right have you got to tell me to stop?  By&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Stop!  Listen to me.  I don't know what you've been saying about
    this lady&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "I ain't been saying anything, except what I know, and that is
    that&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Stop!  And I don't care.  But I know about you, sir, because it is
    my business to know.  The Government has had its eye on you for
    some time and it has asked me to look into your record.  I have
    looked into it.  You are not a very dangerous person, Mr. Babbitt,
    but that is because of your lack of ability to harm, not because of
    any good will on your part toward the United States.  You have done
    all the harm you could, you have talked sedition, you've written
    and talked against the draft, you have corresponded with German
    agents in Boston and New York."
</p>
<p>
    "That's a lie."
</p>
<p>
    "No, it's the truth.  I have copies of your letters and the
    Government has the originals.  They are not very dangerous, but
    that is because you are not big enough to be dangerous.  The
    authorities have left you pretty much to my discretion, sir.  It
    rests with me whether to have you taken in charge and held for
    trial or merely to warn you and watch you.  Very well.  I warn you
    now and you may be certain that you are watched.  You'll stop your
    silly, seditious talk at once and you'll write no more letters like
    those I have seen.  If you do it will be a prison term for you as
    sure as I stand here.  Do you understand?"
</p>
<p>
    Apparently Phineas understood.  His face was not as red as it had
    been and there was a different look in his eye.  Jed's rough
    handling had not frightened him, but the Major's cold, incisive
    tones and the threat of a term in prison had their effect.
    Nevertheless he could still bluster.
</p>
<p>
    "You can't talk to me that way," he sputtered.  "I&#8212;I ain't scared
    of you even if you are all dressed up in fuss and feathers like a
    hand-organ monkey.  This is a free country."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it is.  For decent people it is absolutely free.  The other
    sort have to be put where they can't interfere with that freedom.
    Whether you, Babbit, remain free or not depends entirely upon what
    you do&#8212;and say.  Is this perfectly clear?"
</p>
<p>
    Phineas did not answer the question directly.  For a moment he
    stood there, his fists clenching and unclenching, and his eyes
    snapping.  Then he turned away.
</p>
<p>
    "All right," he said, sullenly.  "I hear what you say.  Now I can
    go, I presume likely&#8212;unless you've got some more lyin' and
    bullyin' to do.  Get out of my way, Shavin's, you fool."
</p>
<p>
    But Grover had not finished with him.
</p>
<p>
    "Just a minute," he said.  "There is one thing more.  I don't know
    what it is, and I don't wish to know, but evidently you have been
    saying, or threatening to say, something concerning this lady, Mrs.
    Armstrong, which should not be said.  You are not to mention her
    name.  Do you understand that?"
</p>
<p>
    The little hardware dealer almost jumped from the floor as his rage
    again got the better of him.
</p>
<p>
    "The blazes I ain't!" he shrieked.  "Who says I ain't?  Is that any
    of your business, Mr.&#8212;Mr. Brass Monkey?  What's you or the United
    States gov'ment got to say about my mentionin' names?  To the devil
    with the United States and you, too!  You hear that?"
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover smiled.  "Yes," he said, quietly.  "I hear it.  So
    does Mr. Winslow here, and Mrs. Armstrong.  They can be called as
    witnesses if it is necessary.  You had better let me finish,
    Babbitt.  As I say, you are not to mention Mrs. Armstrong's name,
    you are not to repeat or circulate any scandal or story reflecting
    upon her character&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Or her brother's either," put in Jed, eagerly.  "Tell him he can't
    talk against Charlie, either."
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly.  You are not to repeat or circulate anything derogatory
    to the character of either Mrs. Armstrong or Mr. Phillips.  In any
    way derogatory."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas tossed both fists in the air.
</p>
<p>
    "You can't order me around that way," he yelled.  "Besides, if you
    knew what I know about that gang you'd&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hush!  I don't want to know anything you know&#8212;or pretend to know.
    As for ordering you about&#8212;well, we'll see."
</p>
<p>
    "I tell you you can't.  You ain't got the right."
</p>
<p>
    "Perhaps not.  But I have the right to use my discretion&#8212;my
    judgment in your case.  And my judgment is that if I hear one
    scandalous story about town reflecting upon the character of Mrs.
    Armstrong or her brother&#8212;yes, or her friends&#8212;I shall know who is
    responsible and I shall have you arrested and held for trial as an
    enemy of the country.  You condemned the United States to the devil
    only a moment ago in my hearing.  Do you think that would help you
    in court, Babbitt?  I don't."
</p>
<p>
    The little man's face was a sight.  As Jed said afterward, he
    looked as if he would have enjoyed biting his way out of the shop.
</p>
<p>
    "Huh!" he snarled; "I see.  You're all in together, the whole lot
    of you.  And you, you brass buttons, you're usin' your soldierin'
    job to keep your friends out of trouble. . . .  Huh!  Yes, that's
    what you're doin'."
</p>
<p>
    The Major's smile was provokingly cool.
</p>
<p>
    "Perhaps I am," he admitted.  "But I shouldn't advise you to forget
    what I have just told you, Babbitt.  I mean every word of it."
</p>
<p>
    It was Ruth who spoke next.  She uttered a startled exclamation.
</p>
<p>
    "There's some one coming up the walk," she cried.  "Listen."
</p>
<p>
    Sure enough, heavy footsteps sounded upon the walk leading from the
    front gate to the shop.  Jed ran to the window.
</p>
<p>
    "It's Sam," he exclaimed.  "Good heavens above!  It's Sam Hunniwell,
    of all folks&#8212;now!"
</p>
<p>
    Grover looked from one face to the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Is there any particular reason why Captain Hunniwell shouldn't
    come?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    Jed and Ruth were silent.  Phineas chuckled malevolently.  Jed
    heard the chuckle and spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "'Twas&#8212;'twas Cap'n Sam he was goin' to tell," he whispered,
    pointing at Babbitt.  Ruth caught her breath with a frightened
    gasp.
</p>
<p>
    Grover nodded.  "Oh, I see," he said.  "Well, I don't think he
    will.  He'll be more&#8212;more&#8212;careful, I'm sure.  Babbitt, remember."
</p>
<p>
    They heard the captain rattle the latch of the front door.  Ruth
    opened the door behind her.  "I must go, Jed," she whispered.
    "I&#8212;I can't stay."
</p>
<p>
    The Major turned.  "I'll go with you, Mrs. Armstrong," he said.
    But Jed leaned forward.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I wish you'd stay, Major Grover," he whispered.  "I&#8212;I'd like
    to have you stay here just a minute or two."
</p>
<p>
    Grover hesitated.  Ruth went out, closing the living-room door
    after her.  A moment later Captain Sam came into the workshop.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Jed!" he hailed.  "Why, hello, Major!  What&#8212;"  Then for
    the first time he saw and recognized the third member of the group.
    He looked at Phineas and the little man looked at him.  The looks
    were studies in expression.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" grunted Captain Sam.  "What in time&#8212;? . . .  Humph! . . .
    Well, Phin, you look awful glad to see me, I must say.  Gracious
    king, man, don't glower at me like that!  I haven't done anything
    to you, if you'd only have sense enough to believe it."
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt did not answer.  He looked as if he were going to burst.
    Major Grover was regarding him with a whimsical twinkle in his eye.
</p>
<p>
    "Mr. Babbitt and I have just been discussing some points connected
    with the war," he observed.  "I don't know that we agree, exactly,
    but we have&#8212;well, we have reached an understanding."
</p>
<p>
    The captain was plainly puzzled.  "Humph!" he grunted.  "You don't
    say! . . .  Well, I&#8212;  Eh, what is it, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    If any one had been watching Jed particularly during the recent few
    minutes they might have observed in his face the dawning of an idea
    and the changing of that idea into a set purpose.  The idea seemed
    to dawn the moment after he saw Captain Hunniwell coming up the
    walk.  It had become a purpose by the time the captain rattled the
    latch.  While Captain Sam and the major were speaking he had
    hastened to the old desk standing by the wall and was rummaging in
    one of the drawers.  Now he came forward.
</p>
<p>
    "Sam&#8212;" he began, but broke off to address Mr. Babbitt, who was
    striding toward the door.  "Don't go, Phin," he cried.  "I'd rather
    you didn't go just this minute.  I'd like to have you stay.  Please."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas answered over his shoulder.  The answer was a savage snarl
    and a command for "Shavings" to mind his own business.  Grover
    spoke then.
</p>
<p>
    "Mr. Babbitt," he suggested, "don't you think you had better stay a
    moment?  Mr. Winslow seems to wish it."
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt reached for the handle of the door, but Grover's hand was
    lightly laid on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Do stay, Mr. Babbitt," begged the Major, sweetly.  "To oblige me,
    you know."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas swore with such vehemence that the oath might have been
    heard across the road.  What he might have said thereafter is a
    question.  At that moment his attention was caught by something
    which Jed Winslow had in his hands and he stayed to stare at it.
    The something was a bundle of crumpled banknotes.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XVIII
</h2>
<p>
    Jed came forward, the roll of bills in his hand.  He seemed quite
    oblivious of the Babbitt stare, or, for that matter, of the
    complete silence which had so suddenly fallen upon the group in the
    shop.  He came forward, smoothing the crumpled notes with fingers
    which shook a little.  He stopped in front of Captain Hunniwell.
    The captain was gazing at him and at the money.  Jed did not meet
    his friend's eye; he continued to smooth the banknotes.  Captain
    Sam spoke first.
</p>
<p>
    "What's that?" he demanded.  "What money's that?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's fingers moved back and forth across the bills and he answered
    without looking up.  He seemed much embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    "Sam," he faltered.  "Sam&#8212;er&#8212;you remember you told me you'd&#8212;er&#8212;
    lost some money a spell ago?  Some&#8212;er&#8212;money you'd collected over
    to Wapatomac.  You remember that, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam looked at him in puzzled surprise.  "Remember it?" he
    repeated.  "Course I remember it.  Gracious king, 'tain't likely
    I'd forget it, is it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "No-o," he drawled, solemnly.  "No, course you
    couldn't.  'Twas four hundred dollars you was short, wan't it?"
</p>
<p>
    The Captain's puzzled look was still there.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he replied.  "What of it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, just this, Sam: I&#8212;I want it to be plain, you
    understand.  I want Major Grover and Phineas here to understand
    the&#8212;the whole of it.  There's a lot of talk, seems so, around town
    about money bein' missin' from the bank&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam interrupted.  "The deuce there is!" he exclaimed.
    "That's the first I've heard of any such talk.  Who's talkin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, a&#8212;a good many folks, I judge likely.  Gabe Bearse asked
    Babbie about it, and Phin here he&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?"  The captain turned to face his old enemy.  "So you've been
    talkin', have you?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Babbitt leaned forward.  "I ain't begun my talkin' yet, Sam
    Hunniwell," he snarled.  "When I do you'll&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped.  Grover had touched him on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Sshh!" said the Major quietly.  To the absolute amazement of
    Captain Sam, Phineas subsided.  His face was blazing red and he
    seemed to be boiling inside, but he did not say another word.  Jed
    seized the opportunity to continue.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I just want to get this all plain, Sam," he put in, hastily.
    "I just want it so all hands'll understand it, that's all.  You
    went over to Sylvester Sage's in Wapatomac and he paid you four
    hundred dollars.  When you got back home here fourteen hundred of
    it was missin'.  No, no, I don't mean that.  I mean you couldn't
    find fourteen hundred&#8212;I mean&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The captain's patience was, as he himself often said, moored with a
    short cable.  The cable parted now.
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king!" he snapped.  "Jed, if that yarn you're tryin' to
    spin was wound in a ball and a kitten was playin' with it you
    couldn't be worse snarled up.  What he's tryin' to tell you," he
    explained, turning to Grover, "is that the other day, when I was
    over to Wapatomac, old Sylvester Sage over there paid me fourteen
    hundred dollars in cash and when I got back here all I could find
    was a thousand.  That's what you're tryin' to say, ain't it?"
    turning to Jed once more.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, that's it, Sam.  That's it."
</p>
<p>
    "Course it's it.  But what do you want me to say it for?  And what
    are you runnin' around with all that money in your hands for?
    That's what I want to know."
</p>
<p>
    Jed swallowed hard.  "Well, Sam," he stammered, "that&#8212;that's what
    I was goin' to tell you.  You see&#8212;you see, that's the four hundred
    you lost.  I&#8212;I found it."
</p>
<p>
    Major Grover looked surprised.  Phineas Babbitt looked more
    surprised.  But, oddly enough, it was Captain Sam Hunniwell who
    appeared to be most surprised by his friend's statement.  The
    captain seemed absolutely dumbfounded.
</p>
<p>
    "You&#8212;you WHAT?" he cried.
</p>
<p>
    Jed smoothed the bills in his hand.  "I found it, Sam," he
    repeated.  "Here 'tis&#8212;here."
</p>
<p>
    He extended the bundle of banknotes.  The captain made no move to
    take them.  Jed held them a little nearer.
</p>
<p>
    "You&#8212;you'd better take it, Sam," he urged.  "It might get lost
    again, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Still Captain Sam made no move.  He looked from the bills in Jed's
    hands to Jed's face and back again.  The expression on his own face
    was a strange one.
</p>
<p>
    "You found it," he repeated.  "YOU did?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, I found it, Sam.  Just happened to."
</p>
<p>
    "Where did you find it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Over yonder behind that pile of boards.  You know you said the
    money was in your overcoat pocket and&#8212;and when you came in here on
    your way back from Sylvester's you hove your coat over onto those
    boards.  I presume likely the&#8212;the money must have fell out of the
    pocket then.  You see, don't you, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    The tone in which the question was asked was one, almost, of
    pleading.  He appeared very, very anxious to have the captain
    "see."  But the latter seemed as puzzled as ever.
</p>
<p>
    "Here's the money, Sam," urged Jed.  "Take it, won't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam took it, but that is all he did.  He did not count it
    or put it in his pocket.  He merely took it and looked at the man
    who had given it to him.
</p>
<p>
    Jed's confusion seemed to increase.  "Don't you&#8212;don't you think
    you'd better count it, Sam?" he stammered.  "If&#8212;if the Major here
    and Phin see you count it and&#8212;and know it's all right, then
    they'll be able to contradict the stories that's goin' around about
    so much bein' stolen, you know."
</p>
<p>
    The captain grunted.
</p>
<p>
    "Stolen?" he repeated.  "You said folks were talkin' about money
    bein' lost.  Have they been sayin' 'twas stolen?"
</p>
<p>
    It was Grover who answered.  "I haven't heard any such rumors," he
    said.  "I believe Lieutenant Rayburn said he heard some idle report
    about the bank's having lost a sum of money, but there was no hint
    at dishonesty."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam turned to Mr. Babbitt.
</p>
<p>
    "YOU haven't heard any yarns about money bein' stolen at the bank,
    have you?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    Before Phineas could answer Grover's hand again fell lightly on his
    shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm sure he hasn't," observed the Major.  The captain paid no
    attention to him.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you?" he repeated, addressing Babbitt.
</p>
<p>
    The little man shook from head to foot.  The glare with which he
    regarded his hated rival might have frightened a timid person.  But
    Captain Sam Hunniwell was distinctly not timid.
</p>
<p>
    "Have you?" he asked, for the third time.
</p>
<p>
    Phineas' mouth opened, but Grover's fingers tightened on his
    shoulder and what came out of that mouth was merely a savage
    repetition of his favorite retort, "None of your darned business."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, 'tis my business," began Captain Sam, but Jed interrupted.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't see as it makes any difference whether he's heard anything
    or not, Sam," he suggested eagerly.  "No matter what he's heard, it
    ain't so, because there couldn't have been anything stolen.  There
    was only four hundred missin'.  I've found that and you've got it
    back; so that settles it, don't it?"
</p>
<p>
    "It certainly would seem as if it did," observed Grover.
    "Congratulations, Captain Hunniwell.  You're fortunate that so
    honest a man found the money, I should say."
</p>
<p>
    The captain merely grunted.  The odd expression was still on his
    face.  Jed turned to the other two.
</p>
<p>
    "Er&#8212;er&#8212;Major Grover," he said, "if&#8212;if you hear any yarns now
    about money bein' missin'&#8212;or&#8212;or stolen you can contradict 'em
    now, can't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I certainly can&#8212;and will."
</p>
<p>
    "And you'll contradict 'em, too, eh, Phin?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbitt jerked his shoulder from Grover's grasp and strode to the
    door.
</p>
<p>
    "Let me out of here," he snarled.  "I'm goin' home."
</p>
<p>
    No one offered to detain him, but as he threw open the door to the
    outer shop Leonard Grover followed him.
</p>
<p>
    "Just a moment, Babbitt," he said.  "I'll go as far as the gate
    with you, if you don't mind.  Good afternoon, Jed.  Good afternoon,
    Captain, and once more&#8212;congratulations. . . .  Here, Babbitt, wait
    a moment."
</p>
<p>
    Phineas did not wait, but even so his pursuer caught him before he
    reached the gate.  Jed, who had run to the window, saw the Major
    and the hardware dealer in earnest conversation.  The former seemed
    to be doing most of the talking.  Then they separated, Grover
    remaining by the gate and Phineas striding off in the direction of
    his shop.  He was muttering to himself and his face was working
    with emotion.  Between baffled malice and suppressed hatred he
    looked almost as if he were going to cry.  Even amid his own
    feelings of thankfulness and relief Jed felt a pang of pity for
    Phineas Babbitt.  The little man was the incarnation of spite and
    envy and vindictive bitterness, but Jed was sorry for him, just as
    he would have been sorry for a mosquito which had bitten him.  He
    might be obliged to crush the creature, but he would feel that it
    was not much to blame for the bite; both it and Phineas could not
    help being as they were&#8212;they were made that way.
</p>
<p>
    He heard an exclamation at his shoulder and turned to find that
    Captain Sam had also been regarding the parting at the gate.
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!" grunted the captain.  "Phin looks as if he'd been eatin'
    somethin' that didn't set any too good.  What's started him to
    obeyin' orders from that Grover man all to once?  I always thought
    he hated soldierin' worse than a hen hates a swim. . . .  Humph! . . .
    Well, that's the second queerest thing I've run across to-day."
</p>
<p>
    Jed changed the subject, or tried to change it.
</p>
<p>
    "What's the first one, Sam?" he hastened to ask.  His friend looked
    at him for an instant before he answered.
</p>
<p>
    "The first one?" he repeated, slowly.  "Well, I'll tell you, Jed.
    The first one&#8212;and the queerest of all&#8212;is your findin' that four
    hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was a good deal taken aback.  He had not expected an answer of
    that kind.  His embarrassment and confusion returned.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why," he stammered, "is&#8212;is that funny, Sam?  I don't&#8212;I
    don't know's I get what you mean.  What's&#8212;what is there funny
    about my findin' that money?"
</p>
<p>
    The captain stepped across the shop, pulled forward a chair and
    seated himself.  Jed watched him anxiously.
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I don't see anything very funny about my findin' that money,
    Sam," he said, again.  Captain Sam grunted.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you?" he asked.  "Well, maybe my sense of humor's gettin'
    cross-eyed or&#8212;or somethin'.  I did think I could see somethin'
    funny in it, but most likely I was mistaken.  Sit down, Jed, and
    tell me all about how you found it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed hesitated.  His hand moved slowly across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, now, Sam," he faltered, "there ain't nothin' to tell.  I
    just&#8212;er&#8212;found it, that's all. . . .  Say, you ain't seen that new
    gull vane of mine lately, have you?  I got her so she can flop her
    wings pretty good now."
</p>
<p>
    "Hang the gull vane!  I want to hear how you found that money.
    Gracious king, man, you don't expect I'm goin' to take the gettin'
    back of four hundred dollars as cool as if 'twas ten cents, do you?
    Sit down and tell me about it."
</p>
<p>
    So Jed sat, not with eagerness, but more as if he could think of no
    excuse for refusing.  His companion tilted back in his chair, lit a
    cigar, and bade him heave ahead.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," began Jed, "I&#8212;I&#8212;you see, Sam, I happened to look behind
    that heap of boards there and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "What made you think of lookin' behind those boards?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Why, nothin' 'special.  I just happened to look.  That's
    where your coat was, you know.  So I looked and&#8212;and there 'twas."
</p>
<p>
    "I see.  There 'twas, eh?  Where?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, behind the boards.  I told you that, you know."
</p>
<p>
    "Gracious king, course I know!  You've told me that no less than
    ten times.  But WHERE was it?  On the boards?  On the floor?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, . . . oh, seems to me 'twas on the floor."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you KNOW 'twas on the floor?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why . . . why, yes, sartin."
</p>
<p>
    "Then what made you say 'seems as if' it was there?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, . . . oh, I don't know.  Land sakes, Sam, what are you askin'
    me all these questions for?"
</p>
<p>
    "Just for fun, I guess.  I'm interested, naturally.  Tell me some
    more.  How was the money&#8212;all together, or kind of scattered 'round?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, all together."
</p>
<p>
    "Sure of that?"
</p>
<p>
    "Course I'm sure of it.  I can see it just as plain as day, now I
    come to think of it.  'Twas all together, in a heap like."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  The band that was round it had come off, then?"
</p>
<p>
    "Band?  What band?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, the paper band with '$400' on it.  That had come off when it
    fell out of my pocket, I presume likely."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes. . . .  Yes, I guess likely it did.  Must have. . . .  Er&#8212;
    Sam, let me show you that gull vane.  I got it so now that&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hold on a minute.  I'm mighty interested about your findin' this
    money.  It's so&#8212;so sort of unexpected, as you might say.  If that
    band came off it must have broke when the money tumbled down behind
    the boards.  Let's see if it did."
</p>
<p>
    He rose and moved toward the pile of boards.  Jed also rose.
</p>
<p>
    "What are you goin' to look for?" he asked, anxiously.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, the paper band with the '$400' on it.  I'd like to see if it
    broke. . . .  Humph!" he added, peering down into the dark crevice
    between the boards and the wall of the shop.  "Can't see anything
    of it, can you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, peering solemnly down, shook his head.  "No," he said.  "I
    can't see anything of it."
</p>
<p>
    "But it may be there, for all that."  He reached down.  "Humph!" he
    exclaimed.  "I can't touch bottom.  Jed, you've got a longer arm
    than I have; let's see if you can."
</p>
<p>
    Jed, sprawled upon the heap of lumber, stretched his arm as far as
    it would go.  "Hum," he drawled, "I can't quite make it, Sam. . . .
    There's a place where she narrows way down here and I can't get my
    fingers through it."
</p>
<p>
    "Is that so?  Then we'd better give up lookin' for the band, I
    cal'late.  Didn't amount to anything, anyhow.  Tell me more about
    what you did when you found the money.  You must have been
    surprised."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Land sakes, I was.  I don't know's I ever was so
    surprised in my life.  Thinks I, 'Here's Sam's money that's missin'
    from the bank.'  Yes, sir, and 'twas, too."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, I'm much obliged to you, Jed, I surely am.  And when you
    found it&#8212;  Let's see, you found it this mornin', of course?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Why&#8212;why, how&#8212;what makes you think I found it this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, because you must have.  'Cause if you'd found it yesterday or
    the day before you'd have told me right off."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;oh, yes, that's so.  Yes, I found it this mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Hadn't you thought to hunt for it afore?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Land sakes, yes . . . yes, I'd hunted lots of times,
    but I hadn't found it."
</p>
<p>
    "Hadn't thought to look in that place, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's it. . . .  Say, Sam, what&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "It's lucky you hadn't moved those boards.  If you'd shifted them
    any since I threw my coat on 'em you might not have found it for a
    month, not till you used up the whole pile.  Lucky you looked afore
    you shifted the lumber."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes . . . yes, that's so.  That's a fact.  But, Sam, hadn't you
    better take that money back to the bank?  The folks up there don't
    know it's been found yet.  They'll be some surprised, too."
</p>
<p>
    "So they will.  All hands'll be surprised.  And when I tell 'em how
    you happened to see that money lyin' in a pile on the floor behind
    those boards and couldn't scarcely believe your eyes, and couldn't
    believe 'em until you'd reached down and picked up the money, and
    counted it&#8212;  That's about what you did, I presume likely, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes. . . .  Yes, that's just it."
</p>
<p>
    "They'll be surprised then, and no wonder.  But they'd be more
    surprised if I should bring 'em here and show 'em the place where
    you found it.  'Twould surprise 'most anybody to know that there
    was a man livin' who could see down a black crack four foot deep
    and two inches wide and around a corner in that crack and see money
    lyin' on the floor, and know 'twas money, and then stretch his arm
    out a couple of foot more and thin his wrist down until it was less
    than an inch through and pick up that money.  That WOULD surprise
    em.  Don't you think 'twould, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    The color left Jed's face.  His mouth fell open and he stared
    blankly at his friend.  The latter chuckled.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you think 'twould surprise 'em, Jed?" he repeated.  "Seems
    likely as if 'twould.  It surprised me all right enough."
</p>
<p>
    The color came surging back.  Jed's cheeks flamed.  He tried to
    speak, but what he said was not coherent nor particularly
    intelligible.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now&#8212;now, Sam," he stammered.  "I&#8212;I&#8212;  You don't understand.
    You ain't got it right.  I&#8212;I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    The captain interrupted.  "Don't try so hard, Jed," he continued.
    "Take time to get your steam up.  You'll bust a b'iler if you puff
    that way.  Let's see what it is I don't understand.  You found this
    money behind those boards?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Yes . . . yes . . . but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Wait.  And you found it this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes . . . yes . . . but, Sam&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hold on.  You saw it layin' on the floor at the bottom of that
    crack?"
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;well, I don't know as I saw it exactly, but&#8212;but&#8212;  No, I
    didn't see it.  I&#8212;I felt it."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you felt it!  Thought you said you saw it.  Well, you reached
    down and felt it, then.  How did you get your arm stretched out
    five foot long and three-quarters of an inch thick?  Put it under
    the steam roller, did you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed swallowed twice before replying.  "I&#8212;I&#8212;" he began.  "Well&#8212;
    well, come to think of it, Sam, I&#8212;I guess I didn't feel it with my
    fingers.  I&#8212;I took a stick.  Yes, that was it.  I poked in behind
    there with a stick."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, you felt it with a stick.  And knew 'twas money?  Tut, tut!
    You must have a good sense of touch, Jed, to know bills when you
    scratch across 'em with the far end of a five foot stick.  Pick 'em
    up with a stick, too, did you?"
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow was speechless.  Captain Sam shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "And that ain't the most astonishin' part either," he observed.
    "While those bills were in the dark at the bottom of that crack
    they must have sprouted.  They went in there nothin' but tens and
    twenties.  These you just gave me are fives and twos and all sorts.
    You'd better poke astern of those boards again, Jed.  The roots
    must be down there yet; all you've scratched up are the sprouts."
</p>
<p>
    His only answer was a hopeless groan.  Captain Sam rose and,
    walking over to where his friend sat with his face buried between
    his hands, laid his own hand on the latter's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "There, there, Jed," he said, gently.  "I beg your pardon.  I'm
    sorry I stirred you up this way.  'Twas mean of me, I know, but
    when you commenced givin' me all this rigmarole I couldn't help it.
    You never was meant for a liar, old man; you make a mighty poor
    fist at it.  What is it all about?  What was you tryin' to do it
    for?"
</p>
<p>
    Another groan.  The captain tried again.
</p>
<p>
    "What's the real yarn?" he asked.  "What are you actin' this way
    for?  Course I know you never found the money.  Is there somebody&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "No!  No, no!"  Jed's voice rose almost to a shout.  He sprang to
    his feet and clutched at Captain Sam's coat-sleeve.  "No," he
    shouted.  "Course there ain't anybody.  Wh-what makes you say such
    a thing as that?  I&#8212;I tell you I did find the money.  I did&#8212;I
    did."
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!  Of course you didn't.  I know you didn't.  I KNOW.  Gracious
    king, man, be sensible."
</p>
<p>
    "I did!  I did!  I found it and now I give it back to you.  What
    more do you want, Sam Hunniwell?  Ain't that enough?"
</p>
<p>
    "Enough!  It's a darned sight too much.  I tell you I know you
    didn't find it."
</p>
<p>
    "But I did."
</p>
<p>
    "Rubbish!  In the first place, you and I hunted every inch behind
    those boards the very day the money was missin', and 'twa'n't there
    then.  And, besides, this isn't the money I lost."
</p>
<p>
    "Well&#8212;well, what if 'tain't?  I don't care.  I&#8212;I know 'tain't.
    I&#8212;I spent your money."
</p>
<p>
    "You SPENT it?  When?  You told me you only found it this mornin'."
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I know I did, but 'twan't so.  I&#8212;I&#8212;" Jed was in an agony of
    alarm and frantic haste.  "I found your money two or three days
    ago.  Yes, sir, that's when I found it. . . .  Er. . . er . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  Why didn't you tell me you found it then?  If you'd found
    it what made you keep runnin' into the bank to ask me if I'D found
    it?  Why didn't you give it back to me right off?  Oh, don't be so
    ridiculous, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I ain't.  It's true.  I&#8212;I didn't give it back to you because&#8212;
    because I&#8212;I thought first I'd keep it."
</p>
<p>
    "Keep it?  KEEP it?  Steal it, do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, that's what I mean.  I&#8212;I thought first I'd do that and
    then I got&#8212;got kind of sorry and&#8212;and scared and I got some more
    money&#8212;and now I'm givin' it back to you.  See, don't you, Sam?
    That's the reason."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam shook his head.  "So you decided to be a thief, did
    you, Jed?" he said, slowly.  "Well, the average person never'd have
    guessed you was such a desperate character. . . .  Humph! . . .
    Well, well! . . .  What was you goin' to do with the four hundred,
    provided you had kept it?  You spent the money I lost anyway; you
    said you did.  What did you spend it for?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh&#8212;oh, some things I needed."
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!  Is that so?  What things?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's shaking hand moved across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh&#8212;I&#8212;I forget," he faltered.  Then, after a desperate struggle,
    "I&#8212;I&#8212;I bought a suit of clothes."
</p>
<p>
    The effort of this confession was a peculiar one.  Captain Sam
    Hunniwell put back his head and roared with laughter.  He was still
    laughing when he picked up his hat and turned to the door.  Jed
    sprang from his seat.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  You're not GOIN', are you, Sam?" he cried.  The
    captain, wiping his eyes, turned momentarily.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, Jed," he said, chokingly, "I'm goin'.  Say, if&#8212;if you get
    time some of these days dress up in that four hundred dollar suit
    you bought and then send me word.  I'd like to see it."
</p>
<p>
    He went out.  The door of the outer shop slammed.  Jed wiped the
    perspiration from his forehead and groaned helplessly and
    hopelessly.
</p>
<p>
    The captain had reached the gate when he saw Phillips coming along
    the road toward him.  He waited until the young man arrived.
</p>
<p>
    "Hello, Captain," hailed Charles.  "So you decided not to come back
    to the bank this afternoon, after all?"
</p>
<p>
    His employer nodded.  "Yes," he said.  "I've been kept away on
    business.  Funny kind of business, too.  Say, Charlie," he added,
    "suppose likely your sister and you would be too busy to see me for
    a few minutes now?  I'd like to see if you've got an answer to a
    riddle."
</p>
<p>
    "A riddle?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  I've just had the riddle sprung on me and it's got MY head
    whirlin' like a bottle in a tide rip.  Can I come into your house
    for a minute and spring it on you?"
</p>
<p>
    The young man looked puzzled, which was not surprising, but his
    invitation to come into the house was most cordial.  They entered
    by the front door.  As they came into the little hall they heard a
    man's voice in the living-room beyond.  It was Major Grover's voice
    and they heard the major say:
</p>
<p>
    "It doesn't matter at all.  Please understand I had no thought of
    asking.  I merely wanted you to feel that what that fellow said had
    no weight with me whatever, and to assure you that I will make it
    my business to see that he keeps his mouth shut.  As for the other
    question, Ruth&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Ruth Armstrong's voice broke in here.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, please," she begged, "not now.  I&#8212;I am so sorry I can't tell
    you everything, but&#8212;but it isn't my secret and&#8212;and I can't.
    Perhaps some day&#8212;  But please believe that I am grateful, very,
    very grateful.  I shall never forget it."
</p>
<p>
    Charlie, with an anxious glance at Captain Hunniwell, cleared his
    throat loudly.  The captain's thoughts, however, were too busy with
    his "riddle" to pay attention to the voices in the living-room.  As
    he and Phillips entered that apartment Major Grover came into the
    hall.  He seemed a trifle embarrassed, but he nodded to Captain
    Sam, exchanged greetings with Phillips, and hurried out of the
    house.  They found Ruth standing by the rear window and looking out
    toward the sea.
</p>
<p>
    The captain plunged at once into his story.  He began by asking
    Mrs. Armstrong if her brother had told her of the missing four
    hundred dollars.  Charles was inclined to be indignant.
</p>
<p>
    "Of course I haven't," he declared.  "You asked us all to keep
    quiet about it and not to tell a soul, and I supposed you meant
    just that."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  So I did, Charlie, so I did.  Beg your pardon, boy.  I might
    have known you'd keep your hatches closed.  Well, here's the yarn,
    Mrs. Armstrong.  It don't make me out any too everlastin'
    brilliant.  A grown man that would shove that amount of money into
    his overcoat pocket and then go sasshayin' from Wapatomac to Orham
    ain't the kind I'd recommend to ship as cow steward on a cattle
    boat, to say nothin' of president of a bank.  But confessin's good
    for the soul, they say, even if it does make a feller feel like a
    fool, so here goes.  I did just that thing."
</p>
<p>
    He went on to tell of his trip to Wapatomac, his interview with
    Sage, his visit to the windmill shop, his discovery that four
    hundred of the fourteen hundred had disappeared.  Then he told of
    his attempts to trace it, of Jed's anxious inquiries from day to
    day, and, finally, of the scene he had just passed through.
</p>
<p>
    "So there you are," he concluded.  "I wish to mercy you'd tell me
    what it all means, for I can't tell myself.  If it hadn't been so&#8212;
    so sort of pitiful, and if I hadn't been so puzzled to know what
    made him do it, I cal'late I'd have laughed myself sick to see poor
    old Jed tryin' to lie.  Why, he ain't got the first notion of how
    to begin; I don't cal'late he ever told a real, up-and-down lie
    afore in his life.  That was funny enough&#8212;but when he began to
    tell me he was a thief!  Gracious king!  And all he could think of
    in the way of an excuse was that he stole the four hundred to buy a
    suit of clothes with.  Ho, ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    He roared again.  Charlie Phillips laughed also.  But his sister
    did not laugh.  She had seated herself in the rocker by the window
    when the captain began his tale and now she had drawn back into the
    corner where the shadows were deepest.
</p>
<p>
    "So there you are," said Captain Sam, again.  "There's the riddle.
    Now what's the answer?  Why did he do it?  Can either of you guess?"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips shook his head.  "You have got me," he declared.  "And the
    money he gave you was not the money you lost?  You're sure of that?"
</p>
<p>
    "Course I'm sure of it.  In the first place I lost a packet of
    clean tens and twenties; this stuff I've got in my pocket now is
    all sorts, ones and twos and fives and everything.  And in the
    second place&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Pardon me, just a minute, Captain Hunniwell.  Where did he get the
    four hundred to give you, do you think?  He hasn't cashed any large
    checks at the bank within the last day or two, and he would
    scarcely have so much on hand in his shop."
</p>
<p>
    "Not as much as that&#8212;no.  Although I've known the absent-minded,
    careless critter to have over two hundred knockin' around among his
    tools and chips and glue pots.  Probably he had some to start with,
    and he got the rest by gettin' folks around town and over to
    Harniss to cash his checks.  Anthony Hammond over there asked me a
    little while ago, when I met him down to the wharf, if I thought
    Shavin's Winslow was good for a hundred and twenty-five.  Said Jed
    had sent over by the telephone man's auto and asked him to cash a
    check for that much.  Hammond said he thought 'twas queer he hadn't
    cashed it at our bank; that's why he asked me about it."
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  But why should he give his own money away in that fashion?
    And confess to stealing and all that stuff?  I never heard of such
    a thing."
</p>
<p>
    "Neither did anybody else.  I've known Jed all my life and I never
    can tell what loony thing he's liable to do next.  But this beats
    all of 'em, I will give in."
</p>
<p>
    "You don't suppose&#8212;you don't suppose he is doing it to help you,
    because you are his friend?  Because he is afraid the bank&#8212;or you&#8212;
    may get into trouble because of&#8212;well, because of having been so
    careless?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam laughed once more.  "No, no," he said.  "Gracious king,
    I hope my reputation's good enough to stand the losin' of four
    hundred dollars.  And Jed knows perfectly well I could put it back
    myself, if 'twas necessary, without runnin' me into the poorhouse.
    No, 'tain't for me he's doin' it.  I ain't the reason."
</p>
<p>
    "And you're quite sure his story is ALL untrue.  You don't imagine
    that he did find the money, your money, and then, for some reason
    or other, change it with smaller bills, and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Sshh, sshh, Charlie, don't waste your breath.  I told you I KNEW
    he hadn't found the four hundred dollars I lost, didn't I?  Well, I
    do know it and for the very best of reasons; in fact, my stoppin'
    into his shop just now was to tell him what I'd heard.  You see,
    Charlie, old Sylvester Sage has got back from Boston and opened up
    his house again.  And he telephoned me at two o'clock to say that
    the four hundred dollar packet was layin' on his sittin'-room table
    just where I left it when he and I parted company four days or so
    ago.  That's how I KNOW Jed didn't find it."
</p>
<p>
    From the shadowy corner where Ruth Armstrong sat came a little gasp
    and an exclamation.  Charles whistled.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, by George!" he exclaimed.  "That certainly puts a crimp in
    Jed's confession."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin sure it does.  When Sylvester and I parted we was both
    pretty hot under the collar, havin' called each other's politics
    about every mean name we could think of.  I grabbed up my gloves,
    and what I thought was my money from the table and slammed out of
    the house.  Seems all I grabbed was the two five hundred packages;
    the four hundred one was shoved under some papers and magazines and
    there it stayed till Sylvester got back from his Boston cruise.
</p>
<p>
    "But that don't answer my riddle," he added, impatiently.  "What
    made Jed act the way he did?  Got the answer, Charlie?"
</p>
<p>
    The young man shook his head.  "No, by George, I haven't!" he
    replied.
</p>
<p>
    "How about you, Mrs. Armstrong?  Can you help us out?"
</p>
<p>
    Ruth's answer was brief.  "No, I'm afraid not," she said.  There
    was a queer note in her voice which caused her brother to glance at
    her, but Captain Hunniwell did not notice.  He turned to go.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he said, "I wish you'd think it over and see if you can spy
    land anywheres ahead.  I need a pilot.  This course is too crooked
    for me.  I'm goin' home to ask Maud; maybe she can see a light.  So
    long."
</p>
<p>
    He went out.  When Charles returned, having accompanied his
    employer as far as the door, he found Ruth standing by her chair
    and looking at him.  A glance at her face caused him to stop short
    and look at her.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, Ruth," he asked, "what is it?"
</p>
<p>
    She was pale and trembling.  There were tears in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Charlie," she cried, "can't you see?  He&#8212;he did it for you."
</p>
<p>
    "Did it for me?  Did what?  Who?  What are you talking about, Sis?"
</p>
<p>
    "Jed.  Jed Winslow.  Don't you see, Charlie?  He pretended to have
    found the money and to have stolen it just to save you.  He thought
    you&#8212;he thought you had taken it."
</p>
<p>
    "WHAT?  Thought I had taken it?  I had?  Why in the devil should he
    think&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He stopped.  When he next spoke it was in a different tone.
</p>
<p>
    "Sis," he asked, slowly, "do you mean that he thought I took this
    money because he knew I had&#8212;had done that thing at Middleford?
    Does he know&#8212;about that?"
</p>
<p>
    The tears were streaming down her cheeks.  "Yes, Charlie," she
    said, "he knows.  He found it out, partly by accident, before you
    came here.  And&#8212;and think how loyal, how wonderful he has been!
    It was through him that you got your opportunity there at the bank.
    And now&#8212;now he has done this to save you.  Oh, Charlie!"

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIX
</h2>
<p>
    The clock in the steeple of the Methodist church boomed eleven
    times and still the lights shone from the sitting-room windows of
    the little Winslow house and from those of Jed's living quarters
    behind his windmill shop.  At that time of year and at that time of
    night there were few windows alight in Orham, and Mr. Gabe Bearse,
    had he been astir at such an hour, might have wondered why the
    Armstrongs and "Shavings" were "settin' up."  Fortunately for every
    one except him, Gabe was in bed and asleep, otherwise he might have
    peeped under Jed's kitchen window shade&#8212;he had been accused of
    doing such things&#8212;and had he done so he would have seen Jed and
    Charlie Phillips in deep and earnest conversation.  Neither would
    have wished to be seen just then; their interview was far too
    intimate and serious for that.
</p>
<p>
    They had been talking since eight.  Charles and his sister had had
    a long conversation following Captain Hunniwell's visit and then,
    after a pretense at supper&#8212;a pretense made largely on Babbie's
    account&#8212;the young man had come straight to the shop and to Jed.
    He had found the latter in a state of extreme dejection.  He was
    sitting before the little writing table in his living-room, his
    elbows on the desk and his head in his hands.  The drawer of the
    table was open and Jed was, apparently, gazing intently at
    something within.  When Phillips entered the room he started,
    hastily slammed the drawer shut, and raised a pale and distressed
    face to his visitor.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he exclaimed.  "Oh, it's you, Charlie, ain't it?  I&#8212;I&#8212;er&#8212;
    good mornin'.  It's&#8212;it's a nice day."
</p>
<p>
    Charles smiled slightly and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "You're a little mixed on the time, aren't you, Jed?" he observed.
    "It WAS a nice day, but it is a nice evening now."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Is it?  Land sakes, I presume likely 'tis.  Must be after
    supper time, I shouldn't wonder."
</p>
<p>
    "Supper time!  Why, it's after eight o'clock.  Didn't you know it?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  No, I guess not.  I&#8212;I kind of lost run of the time, seems
    so."
</p>
<p>
    "Haven't you had any supper?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  I didn't seem to care about supper, somehow."
</p>
<p>
    "But haven't you eaten anything?"
</p>
<p>
    "No.  I did make myself a cup of tea, but twan't what you'd call a
    success. . . .  I forgot to put the tea in it. . . .  But it don't
    make any difference; I ain't hungry&#8212;or thirsty, either."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips leaned forward and laid a hand on the older man's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he said gently, "I know why you're not hungry.  Oh, Jed,
    what in the world made you do it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed started back so violently that his chair almost upset.  He
    raised a hand with the gesture of one warding off a blow.
</p>
<p>
    "Do?" he gasped.  "Do what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, what you did about that money that Captain Hunniwell lost.
    What made you do it, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's eyes closed momentarily.  Then he opened them and, without
    looking at his visitor, rose slowly to his feet.
</p>
<p>
    "So Sam told you," he said, with a sigh.  "I&#8212;I didn't hardly think
    he'd do that. . . .  Course 'twas all right for him to tell," he
    added hastily.  "I didn't ask him not to, but&#8212;but, he and I havin'
    been&#8212;er&#8212;chums, as you might say, for so long, I&#8212;I sort of
    thought. . . .  Well, it don't make any difference, I guess.  Did
    he tell your&#8212;your sister?  Did he tell her how I&#8212;how I stole the
    money?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles shook his head.
</p>
<p>
    "No," he said quietly.  "No, he didn't tell either of us that.  He
    told us that you had tried to make him believe you took the money,
    but that he knew you were not telling the truth.  He knew you
    didn't take it."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Now . . . now, Charlie, that ain't so."  Jed was even more
    disturbed and distressed than before.  "I&#8212;I told Sam I took it
    and&#8212;and kept it.  I TOLD him I did.  What more does he want?
    What's he goin' around tellin' folks I didn't for?  What&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, Jed!  He knows you didn't take it.  He knew it all the time
    you were telling him you did.  In fact he came into your shop this
    afternoon to tell you that the Sage man over at Wapatomac had found
    the four hundred dollars on the table in his sitting-room just
    where the captain left it.  Sage had just 'phoned him that very
    thing.  He would have told you that, but you didn't give him the
    chance.  Jed, I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    But Jed interrupted.  His expression as he listened had been
    changing like the sky on a windy day in April.
</p>
<p>
    "Here, here!" he cried wildly.  "What&#8212;what kind of talk's that?
    Do&#8212;do you mean to tell me that Sam Hunniwell never lost that money
    at all?  That all he did was leave it over at Wapatomac?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, that's just what I mean."
</p>
<p>
    "Then&#8212;then all the time when I was&#8212;was givin' him the&#8212;the other
    money and tellin' him how I found it and&#8212;and all&#8212;he knew&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Certainly he knew.  I've just told you that he knew."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sat heavily down in the chair once more.  He passed his hand
    slowly across his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "He knew!" he repeated.  "He knew! . . ."  Then, with a sudden gasp
    as the full significance of the thought came to him, he cried:
    "Why, if&#8212;if the money wasn't ever lost you couldn't&#8212;you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Charles shook his head: "No, Jed," he said, "I couldn't have taken
    it.  And I didn't take it."
</p>
<p>
    Jed gasped again.  He stretched out a hand imploringly.  "Oh,
    Lord," he exclaimed, "I never meant to say that.  I&#8212;I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "It's all right, Jed.  I don't blame you for thinking I might have
    taken it.  Knowing what you did about&#8212;well, about my past record,
    it is not very astonishing that you should think almost anything."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's agonized contrition was acute.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't talk so, Charlie!" he pleaded.  "Don't!  I&#8212;I'd ought to be
    ashamed of myself.  I am&#8212;mercy knows I am!  But . . .  Eh?  Why,
    how did you know I knew about&#8212;that?"
</p>
<p>
    "Ruth told me just now.  After Captain Hunniwell had gone, she told
    me the whole thing.  About how Babbie let the cat out of the bag
    and how she told you for fear you might suspect something even
    worse than the truth; although," he added, "that was quite bad
    enough.  Yes, she told me everything.  You've been a brick all
    through, Jed.  And now&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Wait, Charlie, wait.  I&#8212;I don't know what to say to you.  I don't
    know what you must think of me for ever&#8212;ever once suspectin' you.
    If you hadn't said to me only such a little spell ago that you
    needed money so bad and would do most anything to get five hundred
    dollars&#8212;if you hadn't said that, I don't think the notion would
    ever have crossed my mind."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips whistled.  "Well, by George!" he exclaimed.  "I had
    forgotten that.  No wonder you thought I had gone crooked again.
    Humph! . . .  Well, I'll tell you why I wanted that money.  You
    see, I've been trying to pay back to the man in Middleford the
    money of his which&#8212;which I took before.  It is two thousand
    dollars and," with a shrug, "that looks a good deal bigger sum to
    me now than it used to, you can bet on that.  I had a few hundred
    in a New York savings bank before I&#8212;well, before they shut me up.
    No one knew about it, not even Sis.  I didn't tell her because&#8212;
    well, I wish I could say it was because I was intending to use it
    to pay back what I had taken, but that wasn't the real reason why I
    kept still about it.  To tell you the truth, Jed, I didn't feel&#8212;
    no, I don't feel yet any too forgiving or kindly toward that chap
    who had me put in prison.  I'm not shirking blame; I was a fool and
    a scamp and all that; but he is&#8212;he's a hard man, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Seems to me Ru&#8212;your sister said he was a consider'ble
    of a professer," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    "Professor?  Why no, he was a bond broker."
</p>
<p>
    "I mean that he professed religion a good deal.  Called himself a
    Christian and such kind of names."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips smiled bitterly.  "If he is a Christian I prefer to be a
    heathen," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Well, maybe he ain't one.  You could teach a parrot to
    holler 'Praise the Lord,' I cal'late, and the more crackers he got
    by it the louder he'd holler.  So you never said anything about the
    four hundred you had put by, Charlie."
</p>
<p>
    "No.  I felt that I had been treated badly and&#8212;why, Jed, the man
    used to urge me to dress better than I could afford, to belong to
    the most expensive club and all that sort of thing.  He knew I was
    in with a set sporting ten times the money I could muster, and
    spending it, too, but he seemed to like to have me associate with
    them.  Said it was good for the business."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin!  More crackers for Polly.  Go on."
</p>
<p>
    "I intended that he should never have that money, but after I came
    here, after I had been here for a time, I changed my mind.  I saw
    things in a different light.  I wrote him a letter, told him I
    meant to pay back every cent of the two thousand I had taken and
    enclosed my check for the seven hundred and fifty I had put by.
    Since then I have paid him two hundred and fifty more, goodness
    knows how.  I have squeezed every penny from my salary that I could
    spare.  I have paid him half of the two thousand and, if everything
    had gone on well, some day or other I would have paid the other
    half."
</p>
<p>
    Jed laid a hand on his companion's knee.  "Good boy, Charlie," he
    said.  "And how did the&#8212;er&#8212;professin' poll parrot act about your
    payin' it back?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles smiled faintly.  "Just before I talked with you that day,
    Jed," he said, "I received a letter from him stating that he did
    not feel I was paying as rapidly as I could and that, if he did not
    receive another five hundred shortly he should feel it his duty to
    communicate with my present employers.  Do you wonder I said I
    would do almost anything to get the money?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's hand patted the knee sympathetically.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho, sho, sho!" he exclaimed.  "Have you heard from him since?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, I wrote him that I was paying as fast as I could and that if
    he communicated with my employers that would end any chances of his
    ever getting more.  He hasn't written since; afraid of stopping the
    golden egg supply, I presume. . . .  But there," he added, "that's
    enough of that.  Jed, how could you do it&#8212;just for me?  Of course
    I had come to realize that your heart was as big as a bushel
    basket, and that you and I were friends.  But when a fellow gives
    up four hundred dollars of his own money, and, not only does that,
    but deliberately confesses himself a thief&#8212;when he does that to
    save some one else who, as he knew, had really been a thief and who
    he was pretty sure must have stolen again&#8212;why, Jed, it is
    unbelievable.  Why did you do it?  What can I say to you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed held up a protesting hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't say anything," he stammered.  "Don't!  It's&#8212;it's all
    foolishness, anyhow."
</p>
<p>
    "Foolishness!  It's&#8212;oh, I don't know what it is!  And to sacrifice
    your reputation and your character and your friendship with Captain
    Hunniwell, all for me!  I can't understand it."
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now&#8212;now, Charlie, don't try to.  If I can't understand
    myself more'n half the time, what's the use of your strainin' your
    brains?  I&#8212;I just took a notion, that's all.  I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "But, Jed, why did you do it&#8212;for me?  I have heard of men doing
    such things for&#8212;for women, sacrificing themselves to save a woman
    they were in love with.  You read of that in books and&#8212;yes, I
    think I can understand that.  But for you to do it&#8212;for ME!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed waved both hands this time.  "Sshh! sshh!" he cried, in frantic
    protest.  His face was a brilliant crimson and his embarrassment
    and confusion were so acute as to be laughable, although Phillips
    was far from laughing.  "Sshh, sshh, Charlie," pleaded Jed.  "You&#8212;
    you don't know what you're talkin' about.  You're makin' an awful
    fuss about nothin'.  Sshh!  Yes, you are, too.  I didn't have any
    notion of tellin' Sam I stole that four hundred when I first gave
    it to him.  I was goin' to tell him I found it, that's all.  That
    would keep him bottled up, I figgered, and satisfied and then&#8212;then
    you and I'd have a talk and I'd tell you what I'd done and&#8212;well,
    some day maybe you could pay me back the money; don't you see?  I
    do hope," he added anxiously, "you won't hold it against me, for
    thinkin' maybe you had taken it.  Course I'd ought to have known
    better.  I would have known better if I'd been anybody but Shavin's
    Winslow.  HE ain't responsible."
</p>
<p>
    "Hush, Jed, hush!  But why did you say you had&#8212;kept it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Oh, that was Sam's doin's.  He commenced to ask questions,
    and, the first thing I knew, he had me on the spider fryin' over a
    hot fire.  The more I sizzled and sputtered and tried to get out of
    that spider, the more he poked up the fire.  I declare, I never
    knew lyin' was such a job!  When I see how easy and natural it
    comes to some folks I feel kind of ashamed to think what a poor
    show I made at it.  Well, Sam kept pokin' the fire and heatin' me
    up till I got desperate and swore I stole the money instead of
    findin' it.  And that was hoppin' out of the fryin' pan INTO the
    fire," he drawled reflectively.
</p>
<p>
    Charles smiled.  "Captain Sam said you told him you took the money
    to buy a suit of clothes with," he suggested.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Did I?  Sho!  That was a real bright idea of mine, wasn't it?
    A suit of clothes.  Humph!  Wonder I didn't say I bought shoe laces
    or collar buttons or somethin'. . . .  Sho! . . .  Dear, dear!
    Well, they say George Washin'ton couldn't tell a lie and I've
    proved I can't either; only I've tried to tell one and I don't
    recollect that he ever did that. . . .  Humph! . . .  A suit of
    clothes. . . .  Four hundred dollars. . . .  Solomon in all his
    glory would have looked like a calico shirt and a pair of overalls
    alongside of me, eh? . . .  Humph!"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips shook his head.  "Nevertheless, Jed," he declared, "I
    can't understand why you did it and I never&#8212;never shall forget it.
    Neither will Ruth.  She will tell you so to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed was frightened.  "No, no, no, she mustn't," he cried, quickly.
    "I&#8212;I don't want her to talk about it.  I&#8212;I don't want anybody to
    talk about it.  Please tell her not to, Charlie!  Please!  It's&#8212;
    it's all such foolishness anyhow.  Let's forget it."
</p>
<p>
    "It isn't the sort of thing one forgets easily.  But we won't talk
    of it any more just now, if that pleases you better.  I have some
    other things to talk about and I must talk about them with some
    one.  I MUST&#8212;I've got to."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at him.  The words reminded him forcibly of Ruth's on
    that day when she had come to the windmill shop to tell him her
    brother's story and to discuss the question of his coming to Orham.
    She, too, had said that she must talk with some one&#8212;she MUST.
</p>
<p>
    "Have&#8212;you talked 'em over with&#8212;with your sister?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  But she and I don't agree completely in the matter.  You
    see, Ruth thinks the world of me, she always did, a great deal more
    than I deserve, ever have deserved or ever will.  And in this
    matter she thinks first of all of me&#8212;what will become of me
    provided&#8212;well, provided things don't go as I should like to have
    them.  That isn't the way I want to face the question.  I want to
    know what is best for every one, for her, for me and&#8212;and for some
    one else&#8212;most of all for some one else, I guess," he added.
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded slowly.  "For Maud," he said.
</p>
<p>
    Charles looked at him.  "How on earth&#8212;?" he demanded.  "What in
    blazes are you&#8212;a clairvoyant?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  No.  But it don't need a spirit medium to see through a
    window pane, Charlie; that is, the average window pane," he added,
    with a glance at his own, which were in need of washing just then.
    "You want to know," he continued, "what you'd ought to do now that
    will be the right thing, or the nighest to the right thing, for
    your sister and Babbie and yourself&#8212;and Maud."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I do.  It isn't any new question for me.  I've been putting
    it up to myself for a long time, for months; by, George, it seems
    years."
</p>
<p>
    "I know.  I know.  Well, Charlie, I've been puttin' it up to
    myself, too.  Have you got any answer?"
</p>
<p>
    "No, none that exactly suits me.  Have you?"
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know's I have&#8212;exactly."
</p>
<p>
    "Exactly?  Well, have you any, exact or otherwise?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um. . . .  Well, I've got one, but . . . but perhaps it ain't an
    answer.  Perhaps it wouldn't do at all.  Perhaps . . . perhaps . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "Never mind the perhapses.  What is it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Um. . . .  Suppose we let it wait a little spell and talk the
    situation over just a little mite.  You've been talkin' with your
    sister, you say, and she don't entirely agree with you."
</p>
<p>
    "No.  I say things can't go on as they've been going.  They can't."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm.  Meanin'&#8212;what things?"
</p>
<p>
    "Everything.  Jed, do you remember that day when you and I had the
    talk about poetry and all that?  When you quoted that poem about a
    chap's fearing his fate too much?  Well, I've been fearing my fate
    ever since I began to realize what a mess I was getting into here
    in Orham.  When I first came I saw, of course, that I was skating
    on thin ice, and it was likely to break under me at any time.  I
    knew perfectly well that some day the Middleford business was bound
    to come out and that my accepting the bank offer without telling
    Captain Hunniwell or any one was a mighty risky, not to say mean,
    business.  But Ruth was so very anxious that I should accept and
    kept begging me not to tell, at least until they had had a chance
    to learn that I was worth something, that I gave in and . . . I
    say, Jed," he put in, breaking his own sentence in the middle,
    "don't think I'm trying to shove the blame over on to Sis.  It's
    not that."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "Sho, sho, Charlie," he said, "course 'tain't.  I
    understand."
</p>
<p>
    "No, I'll take the blame.  I was old enough to have a mind of my
    own.  Well, as I was saying, I realized it all, but I didn't care
    so much.  If the smash did come, I figured, it might not come until
    I had established myself at the bank, until they might have found
    me valuable enough to keep on in spite of it.  And I worked mighty
    hard to make them like me.  Then&#8212;then&#8212;well, then Maud and I
    became friends and&#8212;and&#8212;oh, confound it, you see what I mean!  You
    must see."
</p>
<p>
    The Winslow knee was clasped between the Winslow hands and the
    Winslow foot was swinging.  Jed nodded again.
</p>
<p>
    "I see, Charlie," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "And&#8212;and here I am.  The smash has come, in a way, already.
    Babbitt, so Ruth tells me, knows the whole story and was threatening
    to tell, but she says Grover assures her that he won't tell, that he,
    the major, has a club over the old fellow which will prevent his
    telling.  Do you think that's true?"
</p>
<p>
    "I shouldn't be surprised.  Major Grover sartinly did seem to put
    the fear of the Lord into Phin this afternoon. . . .  And that's
    no one-horse miracle," he drawled, "when you consider that all
    the ministers in Orham haven't been able to do it for forty odd
    years. . . .  Um. . . .  Yes, I kind of cal'late Phin'll keep his
    hatches shut.  He may bust his b'iler and blow up with spite, but
    he won't talk about you, Charlie, I honestly believe.  And we can
    all thank the major for that."
</p>
<p>
    "I shall thank him, for one!"
</p>
<p>
    "Mercy on us!  No, no.  He doesn't know your story at all.  He just
    thinks Babbitt was circulatin' lies about Ruth&#8212;about your sister.
    You mustn't mention the Middleford&#8212;er&#8212;mess to Major Grover."
</p>
<p>
    "Humph!  Well, unless I'm greatly mistaken, Ruth&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Ruth&#8212;what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, nothing.  Never mind that now.  And allowing that Babbitt
    will, as you say, keep his mouth shut, admitting that the situation
    is just what it was before Captain Hunniwell lost the money or
    Babbitt came into the affair at all, still I've made up my mind
    that things can't go on as they are.  Jed, I&#8212;it's a mighty hard
    thing to say to another man, but&#8212;the world&#8212;my world&#8212;just begins
    and ends with&#8212;with her."
</p>
<p>
    His fists clenched and his jaw set as he said it.  Jed bowed his
    head.
</p>
<p>
    "With Maud, you mean," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  I&#8212;I don't care for anything else or anybody else. . . .
    Oh, of course I don't mean just that, you know.  I do care for Sis
    and Babbie.  But&#8212;they're different."
</p>
<p>
    "I understand, Charlie."
</p>
<p>
    "No, you don't.  How can you?  Nobody can understand, least of all
    a set old crank like you, Jed, and a confirmed bachelor besides.
    Beg pardon for contradicting you, but you don't understand, you
    can't."
</p>
<p>
    Jed gazed soberly at the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Maybe I can understand a little, Charlie," he drawled gently.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, all right.  Let it go at that.  The fact is that I'm at a
    crisis."
</p>
<p>
    "Just a half minute, now.  Have you said anything to Maud about&#8212;
    about how you feel?"
</p>
<p>
    "Of course I haven't," indignantly.  "How could I, without telling
    her everything?"
</p>
<p>
    "That's right, that's right.  Course you couldn't, and be fair and
    honorable. . . .  Hum. . . .  Then you don't know whether or not
    she&#8212;er&#8212;feels the same way about&#8212;about you?"
</p>
<p>
    Charles hesitated.  "No-o," he hesitated.  "No, I don't know, of
    course.  But I&#8212;I feel&#8212;I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "You feel that that part of the situation ain't what you'd call
    hopeless, eh? . . .  Um. . . .  Well, judgin' from what I've heard,
    I shouldn't call it that, either.  Would it surprise you to know,
    Charlie, that her dad and I had a little talk on this very subject
    not so very long ago?"
</p>
<p>
    Evidently it did surprise him.  Charles gasped and turned red.
</p>
<p>
    "Captain Hunniwell!" he exclaimed.  "Did Captain Hunniwell talk
    with you about&#8212;about Maud and&#8212;and me?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, by George!  Then he suspected&#8212;he guessed that&#8212;  That's
    strange."
</p>
<p>
    Jed relinquished the grip of one hand upon his knee long enough to
    stroke his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes," he drawled drily.  "It's worse than strange, it's&#8212;
    er&#8212;paralyzin'.  More clairvoyants in Orham than you thought there
    was; eh, Charlie?"
</p>
<p>
    "But why should he talk with you on that subject; about anything
    so&#8212;er&#8212;personal and confidential as that?  With YOU, you know!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's slow smile drifted into sight and vanished again.  He
    permitted himself the luxury of a retort.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he observed musingly, "as to that I can't say for certain.
    Maybe he did it for the same reason you're doin' it now, Charlie."
</p>
<p>
    The young man evidently had not thought of it in just that light.
    He looked surprised and still more puzzled.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes," he admitted.  "So I am, of course.  And I do talk to
    you about things I never would think of mentioning to other people.
    And Ruth says she does.  That's queer, too.  But we are&#8212;er&#8212;
    neighbors of yours and&#8212;and tenants, you know.  We've known you
    ever since we came to Orham."
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es.  And Sam's known me ever since I came.  Anyhow he talked
    with me about you and Maud.  I don't think I shall be sayin' more'n
    I ought to if I tell you that he likes you, Charlie."
</p>
<p>
    "Does he?" eagerly.  "By George, I'm glad of that!  But, oh, well,"
    with a sigh, "he doesn't know.  If he did know my record he might
    not like me so well.  And as for my marrying his daughter&#8212;good
    NIGHT!" with hopeless emphasis.
</p>
<p>
    "No, not good night by any means.  Maybe it's only good mornin'.
    Go on and tell me what you mean by bein' at a crisis, as you said a
    minute ago."
</p>
<p>
    "I mean just that.  The time has come when I must speak to Maud.  I
    must find out if&#8212;find out how she feels about me.  And I can't
    speak to her, honorably, without telling her everything.  And
    suppose she should care enough for me to&#8212;to&#8212;suppose she should
    care in spite of everything, there's her father.  She is his only
    daughter; he worships the ground she steps on.  Suppose I tell him
    I've been," bitterly, "a crook and a jailbird; what will HE think
    of me&#8212;as a son-in-law?  And now suppose he was fool enough to
    consent&#8212;which isn't supposable&#8212;how could I stay here, working for
    him, sponging a living from him, with this thing hanging over us
    all?  No, I can't&#8212;I can't.  Whatever else happens I can't do that.
    And I can't go on as I am&#8212;or I won't.  Now what am I going to do?"
</p>
<p>
    He had risen and was pacing the floor.  Jed asked a question.
</p>
<p>
    "What does your sister want you to do?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Ruth?  Oh, as I told you, she thinks of no one but me.  How
    dreadful it would be for me to tell of my Middleford record!  How
    awful if I lost my position in the bank!  Suppose they discharged
    me and the town learned why!  I've tried to make her see that,
    compared to the question of Maud, nothing else matters at all, but
    I'm afraid she doesn't see it as I do.  She only sees&#8212;me."
</p>
<p>
    "Her brother.  Um . . . yes, I know."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Well, we talked and talked, but we got nowhere.  So at last
    I said I was coming out to thank you for what you did to save me,
    Jed.  I could hardly believe it then; I can scarcely believe it
    now.  It was too much for any man to do for another.  And she said
    to talk the whole puzzle out with you.  She seems to have all the
    confidence on earth in your judgment, Jed.  She is as willing to
    leave a decision to you, apparently, as you profess to be to leave
    one to your wooden prophet up on the shelf there; what's-his-name&#8212;
    er&#8212;Isaiah."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked greatly pleased, but he shook his head.  "I'm afraid her
    confidence ain't founded on a rock, like the feller's house in the
    Bible," he drawled.  "My decisions are liable to stick half way
    betwixt and between, same as&#8212;er&#8212;Jeremiah's do.  But," he added,
    gravely, "I have been thinkin' pretty seriously about you and your
    particular puzzle, Charlie, and&#8212;and I ain't sure that I don't see
    one way out of the fog.  It may be a hard way, and it may turn out
    wrong, and it may not be anything you'll agree to.  But&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "What is it?  If it's anything even half way satisfactory I'll
    believe you're the wisest man on earth, Jed Winslow."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, if I thought you was liable to believe that I'd tell you to
    send your believer to the blacksmith's 'cause there was somethin'
    wrong with it.  No, I ain't wise, far from it.  But, Charlie, I
    think you're dead right about what you say concernin' Maud and her
    father and you.  You CAN'T tell her without tellin' him.  For your
    own sake you mustn't tell him without tellin' her.  And you
    shouldn't, as a straight up and down, honorable man keep on workin'
    for Sam when you ask him, under these circumstances, to give you
    his daughter.  You can't afford to have her say 'yes' because she
    pities you, nor to have him give in to her because she begs him to.
    No, you want to be independent, to go to both of 'em and say:
    'Here's my story and here am I.  You know now what I did and you
    know, too, what I've been and how I've behaved since I've been with
    you.'  You want to say to Maud: 'Do you care enough for me to marry
    me in spite of what I've done and where I've been?'  And to Sam:
    'Providin' your daughter does care for me, I mean to marry her some
    day or other.  And you can't be on his pay roll when you say that,
    as I see it."
</p>
<p>
    Phillips stopped in his stride.
</p>
<p>
    "You've put it just as it is," he declared emphatically.  "There's
    the situation&#8212;what then?  For I tell you now, Jed Winslow, I won't
    give her up until she tells me to."
</p>
<p>
    "Course not, Charlie, course not.  But there's one thing more&#8212;or
    two things, rather.  There's your sister and Babbie.  Suppose you
    do haul up stakes and quit workin' for Sam at the bank; can they
    get along without your support?  Without the money you earn?"
</p>
<p>
    The young man nodded thoughtfully.  "Yes," he replied, "I see no
    reason why they can't.  They did before I came, you know.  Ruth has
    a little money of her own, enough to keep her and Barbara in the
    way they live here in Orham.  She couldn't support me as a loafer,
    of course, and you can bet I should never let her try, but she
    could get on quite well without me. . . .  Besides, I am not so
    sure that . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  What was you goin' to say, Charlie?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, nothing, nothing.  I have had a feeling, a slight suspicion,
    recently, that&#8212;  But never mind that; I have no right to even hint
    at such a thing.  What are you trying to get at, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    "Get at?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  Why did you ask that question about Ruth and Barbara?  You
    don't mean that you see a way out for me, do you?"
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll, I . . . er . . . I don't cal'late I'd want to go so far
    as to say that, hardly.  No-o, I don't know's it's a way out&#8212;
    quite.  But, as I've told you I've been thinkin' about you and Maud
    a pretty good deal lately and . . . er . . . hum . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "For heaven's sake, hurry up!  Don't go to sleep now, man, of all
    times.  Tell me, what do you mean?  What can I do?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's foot dropped to the floor.  He sat erect and regarded his
    companion intently over his spectacles.  His face was very grave.
</p>
<p>
    "There's one thing you can do, Charlie," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "What is it?  Tell me, quick."
</p>
<p>
    "Just a minute.  Doin' it won't mean necessarily that you're out of
    your worries and troubles.  It won't mean that you mustn't make a
    clean breast of everything to Maud and to Sam.  That you must do
    and I know, from what you've said to me, that you feel you must.
    And it won't mean that your doin' this thing will necessarily make
    either Maud or Sam say yes to the question you want to ask 'em.
    That question they'll answer themselves, of course.  But, as I see
    it, if you do this thing you'll be free and independent, a man
    doin' a man's job and ready to speak to Sam Hunniwell or anybody
    else LIKE a man.  And that's somethin'."
</p>
<p>
    "Something!  By George, it's everything!  What is this man's job?
    Tell me, quick."
</p>
<p>
    And Jed told him.

    CHAPTER XX
</h2>
<p>
    Mr. Gabe Bearse lost another opportunity the next morning.  The
    late bird misses the early worm and, as Gabriel was still slumbering
    peacefully at six A. M., he missed seeing Ruth Armstrong and her
    brother emerge from the door of the Winslow house at that hour
    and walk to the gate together.  Charles was carrying a small
    traveling bag.  Ruth's face was white and her eyes were suspiciously
    damp, but she was evidently trying hard to appear calm and cheerful.
    As they stood talking by the gate, Jed Winslow emerged from the
    windmill shop and, crossing the lawn, joined them.
</p>
<p>
    The three talked for a moment and then Charles held out his hand.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, so long, Jed," he said.  "If all goes well I shall be back
    here to-morrow.  Wish me luck."
</p>
<p>
    "I'll be wishin' it for you, Charlie, all day and all night with
    double time after hours and no allowance for meals," replied Jed
    earnestly.  "You think Sam'll get your note all right?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I shall tuck it under the bank door as I go by.  If he should
    ask what the business was which called me to Boston so suddenly,
    just dodge the question as well as you can, won't you, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin sure.  He'll think he's dealin' with that colored man that
    sticks his head through the sheet over to the Ostable fair, the one
    the boys heave baseballs at.  No, he won't get anything out of me,
    Charlie.  And the other letter; that'll get to&#8212;to her?"
</p>
<p>
    The young man nodded gravely.  "I shall mail it at the post-office
    now," he said.  "Don't talk about it, please.  Well, Sis, good-by&#8212;
    until to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
    Jed turned his head.  When he looked again Phillips was walking
    rapidly away along the sidewalk.  Ruth, leaning over the fence,
    watched him as long as he was in sight.  And Jed watched her
    anxiously.  When she turned he ventured to speak.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't worry," he begged.  "Don't.  He's doin' the right thing.  I
    know he is."
</p>
<p>
    She wiped her eyes.  "Oh, perhaps he is," she said sadly.  "I hope
    he is."
</p>
<p>
    "I know he is.  I only wish I could do it, too. . . .  I would," he
    drawled, solemnly, "only for nineteen or twenty reasons, the first
    one of 'em bein' that they wouldn't let me."
</p>
<p>
    She made no comment on this observation.  They walked together back
    toward the house.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," she said, after a moment, "it has come at last, hasn't it,
    the day we have foreseen and that I have dreaded so?  Poor Charlie!
    Think what this means to him."
</p>
<p>
    Jed nodded.  "He's puttin' it to the touch, to win or lose it all,"
    he agreed, "same as was in the poem he and I talked about that
    time.  Well, I honestly believe he feels better now that he's made
    up his mind to do it, better than he has for many a long day."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I suppose he does.  And he is doing, too, what he has wanted
    to do ever since he came here.  He told me so when he came in from
    his long interview with you last night.  He and I talked until it
    was almost day and we told each other&#8212;many things."
</p>
<p>
    She paused.  Jed, looking up, caught her eye.  To his surprise she
    colored and seemed slightly confused.
</p>
<p>
    "He had not said anything before," she went on rather hurriedly,
    "because he thought I would feel so terribly to have him do it.  So
    I should, and so I do, of course&#8212;in one way, but in another I am
    glad.  Glad, and very proud."
</p>
<p>
    "Sartin.  He'll make us all proud of him, or I miss my guess.  And,
    as for the rest of it, the big question that counts most of all to
    him, I hope&#8212;yes, I think that's comin' out all right, too.  Ruth,"
    he added, "you remember what I told you about Sam's talk with me
    that afternoon when he came back from Wapatomac.  If Maud cares for
    him as much as all that she ain't goin' to throw him over on
    account of what happened in Middleford."
</p>
<p>
    "No&#8212;no, not if she really cares.  But does she care&#8212;enough?"
</p>
<p>
    "I hope so.  I guess so.  But if she doesn't it's better for him to
    know it, and know it now. . . .  Dear, dear!" he added, "how I do
    fire off opinions, don't I?  A body'd think I was loaded up with
    wisdom same as one of those machine guns is with cartridges.  About
    all I'm loaded with is blanks, I cal'late."
</p>
<p>
    She was not paying attention to this outburst, but, standing with
    one hand upon the latch of the kitchen door, she seemed to be
    thinking deeply.
</p>
<p>
    "I think you are right," she said slowly.  "Yes, I think you are
    right.  It IS better to know. . . .  Jed, suppose&#8212;suppose you
    cared for some one, would the fact that her brother had been in
    prison make any difference in&#8212;in your feeling?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed actually staggered.  She was not looking at him, nor did she
    look at him now.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he cried.  "Why&#8212;why, Ruth, what&#8212;what&#8212;?"
</p>
<p>
    She smiled faintly.  "And that was a foolish question, too," she
    said.  "Foolish to ask you, of all men. . . .  Well, I must go on
    and get Babbie's breakfast.  Poor child, she is going to miss her
    Uncle Charlie.  We shall all miss him. . . .  But there, I promised
    him I would be brave.  Good morning, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "But&#8212;but, Ruth, what-what&#8212;?"
</p>
<p>
    She had not heard him.  The door closed.  Jed stood staring at it
    for some minutes.  Then he crossed the lawn to his own little
    kitchen.  The performances he went through during the next hour
    would have confirmed the opinion of Mr. Bearse and his coterie that
    "Shavings" Winslow was "next door to loony."  He cooked a
    breakfast, but how he cooked it or of what it consisted he could
    not have told.  The next day he found the stove-lid lifter on a
    plate in the ice chest.  Whatever became of the left-over pork chop
    which should have been there he had no idea.
</p>
<p>
    Babbie came dancing in at noon on her way home from school.  She
    found her Uncle Jed in a curious mood, a mood which seemed to be a
    compound of absent-mindedness and silence broken by sudden fits of
    song and hilarity.  He was sitting by the bench when she entered
    and was holding an oily rag in one hand and a piece of emery paper
    in the other.  He was looking neither at paper nor rag, nor at
    anything else in particular so far as she could see, and he did not
    notice her presence at all.  Suddenly he began to rub the paper and
    the rag together and to sing at the top of his voice:
</p>
<pre>    "'He's my lily of the valley,
      My bright and mornin' star;
      He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul&#8212;Hallelujah!
      He's my di-dum-du-dum-di-dum&#8212;
      Di&#8212;'"
</pre>
<p>
    Barbara burst out laughing.  Mr. Winslow's hallelujah chorus
    stopped in the middle and he turned.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he exclaimed, looking over his spectacles.  "Oh, it's you!
    Sakes alive, child, how do you get around so quiet?  Haven't
    borrowed the cat's feet to walk, on, have you?"
</p>
<p>
    Babbie laughed again and replied that she guessed the cat wouldn't
    lend her feet.
</p>
<p>
    "She would want 'em herself, prob'ly, Uncle Jed," she added.
    "Don't you think so?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed appeared to consider.
</p>
<p>
    "Well," he drawled, "she might, I presume likely, be as selfish and
    unreasonable as all that.  But then again she might . . . hum . . .
    what was it the cat walked on in that story you and I was readin'
    together a spell ago?  That&#8212;er&#8212;Sure Enough story&#8212;you know.  By
    Kipling, 'twas."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I know!  It wasn't a Sure Enough story; it was a 'Just So'
    story.  And the name of it was 'The Cat Who Walked by His Wild
    Lone.'"
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked deeply disappointed.  "Sho!" he sighed.  "I thought
    'twas on his wild lone he walked.  I was thinkin' that maybe he'd
    gone walkin' on that for a spell and had lent you his feet. . . .
    Hum. . . .  Dear, dear!
</p>
<pre>    "'Oh, trust and obey,
      For there's no other way
      To be de-de-de-di-dum&#8212;
      But to trust and obey.'"
</pre>
<p>
    Here he relapsed into another daydream.  After waiting for a
    moment, Babbie ventured to arouse him.
</p>
<p>
    "Uncle Jed," she asked, "what were you doing with those things in
    your hand&#8212;when I came in, you know?  That cloth and that piece of
    paper.  You looked so funny, rubbing them together, that I couldn't
    help laughing."
</p>
<p>
    Jed regarded her solemnly.  "It's emery paper," he said; "like fine
    sandpaper, you know.  And the cloth's got ile in it.  I'm cleanin'
    the rust off this screwdriver.  I hadn't used it for more'n a
    fortni't and it got pretty rusty this damp weather."
</p>
<p>
    The child looked at him wonderingly.
</p>
<p>
    "But, Uncle Jed," she said, "there isn't any screwdriver.  Anyhow I
    don't see any.  You were just rubbing the sandpaper and the cloth
    together and singing.  That's why it looked so funny."
</p>
<p>
    Jed inspected first one hand and then the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum!" he drawled.  "Hu-um! . . .  Well, I declare! . . .  Now you
    mention it, there don't seem to be any screwdriver, does there? . . .
    Here 'tis on the bench. . . .  And I was rubbin' the sandpaper
    with ile, or ilin' the sandpaper with the rag, whichever you
    like. . . .  Hum, ye-es, I should think it might have looked
    funny. . . .  Babbie, if you see me walkin' around without any
    head some mornin' don't be scared.  You'll know that that part
    of me ain't got out of bed yet, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara leaned her chin on both small fists and gazed at him.
    "Uncle Jed," she said, "you've been thinking about something,
    haven't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Why, yes, I&#8212;I guess likely maybe I have.  How did you
    know?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, 'cause I did.  Petunia and I know you ever and ever so well
    now and we're used to&#8212;to the way you do.  Mamma says things like
    forgetting the screwdriver are your ex-eccen-tricks.  Is this what
    you've been thinking about a nice eccen-trick or the other kind?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed slowly shook his head.  "I&#8212;I don't know," he groaned.  "I
    dasn't believe&#8212;  There, there!  That's enough of my tricks.  How's
    Petunia's hair curlin' this mornin'?"
</p>
<p>
    After the child left him he tried to prepare his dinner, but it was
    as unsatisfactory a meal as breakfast had been.  He couldn't eat,
    he couldn't work.  He could only think, and thinking meant
    alternate periods of delirious hope and black depression.  He sat
    down before the little table in his living-room and, opening the
    drawer, saw Ruth Armstrong's pictured face looking up at him.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!  Oh, Jed!"
</p>
<p>
    It was Maud Hunniwell's voice.  She had entered the shop and the
    living-room without his hearing her and now she was standing behind
    him with her hand upon his shoulder.  He started, turned and looked
    up into her face.  And one glance caused him to forget himself and
    even the pictured face in the drawer for the time and to think only
    of her.
</p>
<p>
    "Maud!" he exclaimed.  "Maud!"
</p>
<p>
    Her hair, usually so carefully arranged, was disordered; her hat
    was not adjusted at its usual exact angle; and as for the silver
    fox, it hung limply backside front.  Her eyes were red and she held
    a handkerchief in one hand and a letter in the other.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
    Jed put out his hands.  "There, there, Maud!" he said.  "There,
    there, little girl."
</p>
<p>
    They had been confidants since her babyhood, these two.  She came
    to him now, and putting her head upon his shoulder, burst into a
    storm of weeping.  Jed stroked her hair.
</p>
<p>
    "There, there, Maud," he said gently.  "Don't, girlie, don't.  It's
    goin' to be all right, I know it. . . .  And so you came to me, did
    you?  I'm awful glad you did, I am so."
</p>
<p>
    "He asked me to come," she sobbed.  "He wrote it&#8212;in&#8212;in the
    letter."
</p>
<p>
    Jed led her over to a chair.  "Sit down, girlie," he said, "and
    tell me all about it.  You got the letter, then?"
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "Yes," she said, chokingly; "it&#8212;it just came.  Oh, I
    am so glad Father did not come home to dinner to-day.  He would
    have&#8212;have seen me and&#8212;and&#8212;oh, why did he do it, Jed?  Why?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed shook his head.  "He had to do it, Maud," he answered.  "He
    wanted to do the right thing and the honorable thing.  And you
    would rather have had him do that, wouldn't you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh&#8212;oh, I don't know.  But why didn't he come to me and tell me?
    Why did he go away and&#8212;and write me he had gone to enlist?  Why
    didn't he come to me first?  Oh. . . .  Oh, Jed, how COULD he treat
    me so?"
</p>
<p>
    She was sobbing again.  Jed took her hand and patted it with his
    own big one.
</p>
<p>
    "Didn't he tell you in the letter why?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, but&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Then let me tell you what he told me, Maud.  He and I talked for
    up'ards of three solid hours last night and I cal'late I understood
    him pretty well when he finished.  Now let me tell you what he said
    to me."
</p>
<p>
    He told her the substance of his long interview with Phillips.  He
    told also of Charles' coming to Orham, of why and how he took the
    position in the bank, of his other talks with him&#8212;Winslow.
</p>
<p>
    "And so," said Jed, in conclusion, "you see, Maud, what a dreadful
    load the poor young feller's been carryin' ever since he came and
    especially since he&#8212;well, since he found out how much he was
    carin' for you.  Just stop for a minute and think what a load
    'twas.  His conscience was troublin' him all the time for keepin'
    the bank job, for sailin' under false colors in your eyes and your
    dad's.  He was workin' and pinchin' to pay the two thousand to the
    man in Middleford.  He had hangin' over him every minute the
    practical certainty that some day&#8212;some day sure&#8212;a person was
    comin' along who knew his story and then the fat would all be in
    the fire.  And when it went into that fire he wouldn't be the only
    one to be burnt; there would be his sister and Babbie&#8212;and you;
    most of all, you."
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "Yes, yes, I know," she cried.  "But why&#8212;oh, why
    didn't he come to me and tell me?  Why did he go without a word?
    He must have known I would forgive him, no matter what he had done.
    It wouldn't have made any difference, his having been in&#8212;in
    prison.  And now&#8212;now he may be&#8212;oh, Jed, he may be killed!"
</p>
<p>
    She was sobbing again.  Jed patted her hand.  "We won't talk about
    his bein' killed," he said stoutly.  "I know he won't be; I feel it
    in my bones.  But, Maud, can't you see why he didn't come and tell
    you before he went to enlist?  Suppose he had.  If you care for him
    so much&#8212;as much as I judge you do&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She interrupted.  "Care for him!" she repeated.  "Oh, Jed!"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, yes, dearie, I know.  Well, then, carin' for him like that,
    you'd have told him just what you told me then; that about his
    havin' done what he did and havin' been where he's been not makin'
    any difference.  And you'd have begged and coaxed him to stay right
    along in the bank, maybe?  Eh?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," defiantly.  Of course I would.  Why not?"
</p>
<p>
    "And your father, would you have told him?"
</p>
<p>
    She hesitated.  "I don't know," she said, but with less assurance.
    "Perhaps so, later on.  It had all been kept a secret so far, all
    the whole dreadful thing, why not a little longer?  Besides&#8212;
    besides, Father knows how much Charlie means to me.  Father and I
    had a long talk about him one night and I&#8212;I think he knows.  And
    he is very fond of Charlie himself; he has said so so many times.
    He would have forgiven him, too, if I had asked him.  He always
    does what I ask."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, ye-es, I cal'late that's so.  But, to be real honest now,
    Maud, would you have been satisfied to have it that way?  Would you
    have felt that it was the honorable thing for Charlie to do?  Isn't
    what he has done better?  He's undertakin' the biggest and finest
    job a man can do in this world to-day, as I see it.  It's the job
    he'd have taken on months ago if he'd felt 'twas right to leave
    Ruth&#8212;Mrs. Armstrong&#8212;so soon after&#8212;after bein' separated from her
    so long.  He's taken on this big job, this man's job, and he says
    to you: 'Here I am.  You know me now.  Do you care for me still?
    If you do will you wait till I come back?'  And to your dad, to
    Sam, he says: 'I ain't workin' for you now.  I ain't on your
    payroll and so I can speak out free and independent.  If your
    daughter'll have me I mean to marry her some day.'  Ain't that the
    better way, Maud?  Ain't that how you'd rather have him feel&#8212;and
    do?"
</p>
<p>
    She sighed and shook her head.  "I&#8212;I suppose so," she admitted.
    "Oh, I suppose that you and he are right.  In his letter he says
    just that.  Would you like to see it; that part of it, I mean?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed took the crumpled and tear-stained letter from her hand.
</p>
<p>
    "I think I ought to tell you, Maud," he said, "that writin' this
    was his own idea.  It was me that suggested his enlistin', although
    I found he'd been thinkin' of it all along, but I was for havin'
    him go and enlist and then come back and tell you and Sam.  But he
    says, 'No.  I'll tell her in a letter and then when I come back
    she'll have had time to think it over.  She won't say 'yes' then
    simply because she pities me or because she doesn't realize what it
    means.  No, I'll write her and then when I come back after enlistin'
    and go to her for my answer, I'll know it's given deliberate.'"
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "He says that there," she said chokingly.  "But he&#8212;he
    must have known.  Oh, Jed, how CAN I let him go&#8212;to war?"
</p>
<p>
    That portion of the letter which Jed was permitted to read was
    straightforward and honest and manly.  There were no appeals for
    pity or sympathy.  The writer stated his case and left the rest to
    her, that was all.  And Jed, reading between the lines, respected
    Charles Phillips more than ever.
</p>
<p>
    He and Maud talked for a long time after that.  And, at last, they
    reached a point which Jed had tried his best to avoid.  Maud
    mentioned it first.  She had been speaking of his friendship for
    her lover and for herself.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't see what we should have done without your help, Jed," she
    said.  "And when I think what you have done for Charlie!  Why, yes&#8212;
    and now I know why you pretended to have found the four hundred
    dollars Father thought he had lost.  Pa left it at Wapatomac, after
    all; you knew that?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed stirred uneasily.  He was standing by the window, looking out
    into the yard.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, yes," he said hastily, "I know.  Don't talk about it, Maud.
    It makes me feel more like a fool than usual and . . . er . . .
    don't seem as if that was hardly necessary, does it?"
</p>
<p>
    "But I shall talk about it.  When Father came home that night he
    couldn't talk of anything else.  He called it the prize puzzle of
    the century.  You had given him four hundred dollars of your own
    money and pretended it was his and that you had&#8212;had stolen it,
    Jed.  He burst out laughing when he told me that and so did I.  The
    idea of your stealing anything!  You!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled, feebly.
</p>
<p>
    "'Twas silly enough, I give in," he admitted.  "You see," he added,
    in an apologetic drawl, "nine-tenths of this town think I'm a prize
    idiot and sometimes I feel it's my duty to live up&#8212;or down&#8212;to my
    reputation.  This was one of the times, that's all.  I'm awful glad
    Sam got his own money back, though."
</p>
<p>
    "The money didn't amount to anything.  But what you did was the
    wonderful thing.  For now I understand why you did it.  You
    thought&#8212;you thought Charlie had taken it to&#8212;to pay that horrid
    man in Middleford.  That is what you thought and you&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Jed broke in.  "Don't!  Don't put me in mind of it, Maud," he
    begged.  "I'm so ashamed I don't know what to do.  You see&#8212;you
    see, Charlie had said how much he needed about that much money and&#8212;
    and so, bein' a&#8212;a woodenhead, I naturally&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, don't!  Please don't!  It was wonderful of you, Jed.  You not
    only gave up your own money, but you were willing to sacrifice your
    good name; to have Father, your best friend, think you a thief.
    And you did it all to save Charlie from exposure.  How could you,
    Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed didn't answer.  He did not appear to have heard her.  He was
    gazing steadily out into the yard.
</p>
<p>
    "How could you, Jed?" repeated Maud.  "It was wonderful!  I can't
    understand.  I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    She stopped at the beginning of the sentence.  She was standing
    beside the little writing-table and the drawer was open.  She
    looked down and there, in that drawer, she saw the framed
    photograph of Ruth Armstrong.  She remembered that Jed had been
    sitting at that desk and gazing down into that drawer when she
    entered the room.  She looked at him now.  He was standing by the
    window peering out into the yard.  Ruth had come from the back door
    of the little Winslow house and was standing on the step looking up
    the road, evidently waiting for Barbara to come from school.  And
    Jed was watching her.  Maud saw the look upon his face&#8212;and she
    understood.
</p>
<p>
    A few moments later she and Ruth met.  Maud had tried to avoid that
    meeting by leaving Jed's premises by the front door, the door of
    the outer shop.  But Ruth had walked to the gate to see if Babbie
    was coming and, as Maud emerged from the shop, the two women came
    face to face.  For an instant they did not speak.  Maud, excited
    and overwrought by her experience with the letter and her interview
    with Jed, was still struggling for self-control, and Ruth, knowing
    that the other must by this time have received that letter and
    learned her brother's secret, was inclined to be coldly defiant.
    She was the first to break the silence.  She said "Good afternoon"
    and passed on.  But Maud, after another instant of hesitation,
    turned back.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Mrs. Armstrong," she faltered, "may I speak with you just&#8212;
    just for a few minutes?"
</p>
<p>
    And now Ruth hesitated.  What was it the girl wished to speak
    about?  If it was to reproach her or her brother, or to demand
    further explanations or apologies, the interview had far better not
    take place.  She was in no mood to listen to reproaches.  Charles
    was, in her eyes, a martyr and a hero and now, largely because of
    this girl, he was going away to certain danger, perhaps to death.
    She had tried, for his sake, not to blame Maud Hunniwell because
    Charles had fallen in love with her, but she was not, just then,
    inclined toward extreme forbearance.  So she hesitated, and Maud
    spoke again.
</p>
<p>
    "May I speak with you for just a few minutes?" she pleaded.  "I
    have just got his letter and&#8212;oh, may I?"
</p>
<p>
    Ruth silently led the way to the door of the little house.
</p>
<p>
    "Come in," she said.
</p>
<p>
    Together they entered the sitting-room.  Ruth asked her caller to
    be seated, but Maud paid no attention.
</p>
<p>
    "I have just got his letter," she faltered.  "I&#8212;I wanted you to
    know&#8212;to know that it doesn't make any difference.  I&#8212;I don't
    care.  If he loves me, and&#8212;and he says he does&#8212;I don't care for
    anything else. . . .  Oh,' PLEASE be nice to me," she begged,
    holding out her hands.  "You are his sister and&#8212;and I love him so!
    And he is going away from both of us."
</p>
<p>
    So Ruth's coldness melted like a fall of snow in early April, and
    the April showers followed it.  She and Maud wept in each other's
    arms and were femininely happy accordingly.  And for at least a
    half hour thereafter they discussed the surpassing excellencies of
    Charlie Phillips, the certainty that Captain Hunniwell would
    forgive him because he could not help it and a variety of kindred
    and satisfying subjects.  And at last Jed Winslow drifted into the
    conversation.
</p>
<p>
    "And so you have been talking it over with Jed," observed Ruth.
    "Isn't it odd how we all go to him when we are in trouble or need
    advice or anything?  I always do and Charlie did, and you say that
    you do, too."
</p>
<p>
    Maud nodded.  "He and I have been what Pa calls 'chummies' ever
    since I can remember," she said simply.
</p>
<p>
    "I don't know why I feel that I can confide in him to such an
    extent.  Somehow I always have.  And, do you know, his advice is
    almost always good?  If I had taken it from the first we might, all
    of us, have avoided a deal of trouble.  I have cause to think of
    Jed Winslow as something sure and safe and trustworthy.  Like a
    nice, kindly old watch dog, you know.  A queer one and a funny one,
    but awfully nice.  Babbie idolizes him."
</p>
<p>
    Maud nodded again.  She was regarding her companion with an odd
    expression.
</p>
<p>
    "And when I think," continued Ruth, "of how he was willing to
    sacrifice his character and his honor and even to risk losing your
    father's friendship&#8212;how he proclaimed himself a thief to save
    Charlie!  When I think of that I scarcely know whether to laugh or
    cry.  I want to do both, of course.  It was perfectly
    characteristic and perfectly adorable&#8212;and so absolutely absurd.  I
    love him for it, and as yet I haven't dared thank him for fear I
    shall cry again, as I did when Captain Hunniwell told us.  Yet,
    when I think of his declaring he took the money to buy a suit of
    clothes, I feel like laughing.  Oh, he IS a dear, isn't he?"
</p>
<p>
    Now, ordinarily, Maud would have found nothing in this speech to
    arouse resentment.  There was the very slight, and in this case
    quite unintentional, note of patronage in it that every one used
    when referring to Jed Winslow.  She herself almost invariably used
    that note when speaking of him or even to him.  But now her
    emotions were so deeply stirred and the memories of her recent
    interview with Jed, of his understanding and his sympathy, were so
    vivid.  And, too, she had just had that glimpse into his most
    secret soul.  So her tone, as she replied to Ruth's speech, was
    almost sharp.
</p>
<p>
    "He didn't do it for Charlie," she declared.  "That is, of course
    he did, but that wasn't the real reason."
</p>
<p>
    "Why, what do you mean?"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you know what I mean?  Don't you really know?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, of course I don't.  What ARE you talking about?  Didn't do it
    for Charlie?  Didn't say that he was a thief and give your father
    his own money, do you mean?  Do you mean he didn't do that for
    Charlie?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  He did it for you."
</p>
<p>
    "For me?  For ME?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes. . . .  Oh, can't you understand?  It's absurd and foolish and
    silly and everything, but I know it's true.  Jed Winslow is in love
    with you, Mrs. Armstrong."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth leaned back in her chair and stared at her as if she thought
    her insane.
</p>
<p>
    "In love with ME?" she repeated.  "Jed Winslow!  Maud, don't!"
</p>
<p>
    "It's true, I tell you.  I didn't know until just now, although if
    it had been any one but Jed I should have suspected for some time.
    But to-day when I went in there I saw him sitting before his desk
    looking down into an open drawer there.  He has your photograph in
    that drawer.  And, later on, when you came out into the yard, I saw
    him watching you; I saw his face and that was enough. . . .  Oh,
    don't you SEE?" impatiently.  "It explains everything.  You
    couldn't understand, nor could I, why he should sacrifice himself
    so for Charlie.  But because Charlie was your brother&#8212;that is
    another thing.  Think, just think!  You and I would have guessed it
    before if he had been any one else except just Jed.  Yes, he is in
    love with you. . . .  It's crazy and it's ridiculous and&#8212;and all
    that, of course it is.  But," with a sudden burst of temper, "if
    you&#8212;if you dare to laugh I'll never speak to you again."
</p>
<p>
    But Ruth was not laughing.
</p>
<p>
    It was a cloudy day and Jed's living-room was almost dark when Ruth
    entered it.  Jed, who had been sitting by the desk, rose when she
    came in.
</p>
<p>
    "Land sakes, Ruth," he exclaimed, "it's you, ain't it?  Let me
    light a lamp.  I was settin' here in the dark like a . . . like a
    hen gone to roost. . . .  Eh?  Why, it's 'most supper 'time, ain't
    it?  Didn't realize 'twas so late.  I'll have a light for you in a
    jiffy."
</p>
<p>
    He was on his way to the kitchen, but she stopped him.
</p>
<p>
    "No," she said quickly.  "Don't get a light.  I'd rather not,
    please.  And sit down again, Jed; just as you were.  There, by the
    desk; that's it.  You see," she added, "I&#8212;I&#8212;well, I have
    something to tell you, and&#8212;and I can tell it better in the dark, I
    think."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at her in surprise.  He could not see her face plainly,
    but she seemed oddly confused and embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho!" he drawled.  "Well, I'm sure I ain't anxious about the
    light, myself.  You know, I've always had a feelin' that the dark
    was more becomin' to my style of beauty.  Take me about twelve
    o'clock in a foggy night, in a cellar, with the lamp out, and I
    look pretty nigh handsome&#8212;to a blind man. . . .  Um-hm."
</p>
<p>
    She made no comment on this confession.  Jed, after waiting an
    instant for her to speak, ventured a reminder.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't mind my talkin' foolishness," he said, apologetically.  "I'm
    feelin' a little more like myself than I have for&#8212;for a week or
    so, and when I feel that way I'm bound to be foolish.  Just gettin'
    back to nature, as the magazine folks tell about, I cal'late 'tis."
</p>
<p>
    She leaned forward and laid a hand on his sleeve.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't!" she begged.  "Don't talk about yourself in that way, Jed.
    When I think what a friend you have been to me and mine I&#8212;I can't
    bear to hear you say such things.  I have never thanked you for
    what you did to save my brother when you thought he had gone wrong
    again.  I can't thank you now&#8212;I can't."
</p>
<p>
    Her voice broke.  Jed twisted in his seat.
</p>
<p>
    "Now&#8212;now, Ruth," he pleaded, "do let's forget that.  I've made a
    fool of myself a good many times in my life&#8212;more gettin' back to
    nature, you see&#8212;but I hope I never made myself out quite such a
    blitherin' numbskull as I did that time.  Don't talk about it,
    don't.  I ain't exactly what you'd call proud of it."
</p>
<p>
    "But I am.  And so is Charlie.  But I won't talk of it if you
    prefer I shouldn't. . . .  Jed&#8212;" she hesitated, faltered, and then
    began again: "Jed," she said, "I told you when I came in that I had
    something to tell you.  I have.  I have told no one else, not even
    Charlie, because he went away before I was&#8212;quite sure.  But now I
    am going to tell you because ever since I came here you have been
    my father confessor, so to speak.  You realize that, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he observed, with great deliberation, "I don't know's
    I'd go as far as to say that.  Babbie and I've agreed that I'm her
    back-step-uncle, but that's as nigh relation as I've ever dast
    figure I was to the family."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't joke about it.  You know what I mean.  Well, Jed, this is
    what I am going to tell you.  It is very personal and very
    confidential and you must promise not to tell any one yet.  Will
    you?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  Why, sartin, of course."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes.  I hope you may be glad to hear it.  It would make you glad
    to know that I was happy, wouldn't it?"
</p>
<p>
    For the first time Jed did not answer in the instant.  The shadows
    were deep in the little living-room now, but Ruth felt that he was
    leaning forward and looking at her.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said, after a moment.  "Yes . . . but&#8212;I don't know as I
    know exactly what you mean, do I?"
</p>
<p>
    "You don't&#8212;yet.  But I hope you will be glad when you do.  Jed,
    you like Major Grover, don't you?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed did not move perceptibly, but she heard his chair creak.  He
    was still leaning forward and she knew his gaze was fixed upon her
    face.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said very slowly.  "I like him first-rate."
</p>
<p>
    "I'm glad.  Because&#8212;well, because I have come to like him so much.
    Jed, he&#8212;he has asked me to be his wife."
</p>
<p>
    There was absolute stillness in the little room.  Then, after what
    seemed to her several long minutes, he spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes . . . yes, I see . . ." he said.  "And you?  You've . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "At first I could not answer him.  My brother's secret was in the
    way and I could not tell him that.  But last night&#8212;or this
    morning&#8212;Charlie and I discussed all our affairs and he gave me
    permission to tell&#8212;Leonard.  So when he came to-day I told him.
    He said it made no difference.  And&#8212;and I am going to marry him,
    Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's chair creaked again, but that was the only sound.  Ruth
    waited until she felt that she could wait no longer.  Then she
    stretched out a hand toward him in the dark.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed," she cried, "aren't you going to say anything to me&#8212;
    anything at all?"
</p>
<p>
    She heard him draw a long breath.  Then he spoke.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, yes, of course," he said.  "I&#8212;I&#8212;of course I am.  I&#8212;
    you kind of got me by surprise, that's all. . . .  I hadn't&#8212;hadn't
    expected it, you see."
</p>
<p>
    "I know.  Even Charlie was surprised.  But you're glad, for my
    sake, aren't you, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Yes, oh, yes!  I'm&#8212;I'm glad."
</p>
<p>
    "I hope you are.  If it were not for poor Charlie's going away and
    the anxiety about him and his problem I should be very happy&#8212;
    happier than I believed I ever could be again.  You're glad of
    that, aren't you, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Yes, yes, of course. . . ."
</p>
<p>
    "And you will congratulate me?  You like Major Grover?  Please say
    you do."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rose slowly from his chair.  He passed a hand in dazed fashion
    across his forehead.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," he said, again.  "The major's a fine man. . . .  I do
    congratulate you, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Jed!  Not that way.  As if you meant it."
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  I&#8212;I do mean it. . . .  I hope&#8212;I hope you'll be real
    happy, both of you, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, not that&#8212;Ruth."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes&#8212;yes, sartin, of course . . . Ruth, I mean."
</p>
<p>
    She left him standing by the writing table.  After she had gone he
    sank slowly down into the chair again.  Eight o'clock struck and he
    was still sitting there. . . .  And Fate chose that time to send
    Captain Sam Hunniwell striding up the walk and storming furiously
    at the back door.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!" roared the captain.  "Jed Winslow!  Jed!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed lifted his head from his hands.  He most decidedly did not wish
    to see Captain Sam or any one else.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed!" roared the captain again.
</p>
<p>
    Jed accepted the inevitable.  "Here I am," he groaned, miserably.
</p>
<p>
    The captain did not wait for an invitation to enter.  Having
    ascertained that the owner of the building was within, he pulled
    the door open and stamped into the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
    "Where are you?" he demanded.
</p>
<p>
    "Here," replied Jed, without moving.
</p>
<p>
    "Here?  Where's here? . . .  Oh, you're in there, are you?  Hidin'
    there in the dark, eh?  Afraid to show me your face, I shouldn't
    wonder.  By the gracious king, I should think you would be!  What
    have you got to say to me, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Apparently Jed had nothing to say.  Captain Sam did not wait.
</p>
<p>
    "And you've called yourself my friend!" he sneered savagely.
    "Friend&#8212;you're a healthy friend, Jed Winslow!  What have you got
    to say to me . . . eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "Maybe I'd be better able to say it if I knew what you
    was talkin' about, Sam," he observed, drearily.
</p>
<p>
    "Know!  I guess likely you know all right.  And according to her
    you've known all along.  What do you mean by lettin' me take that&#8212;
    that state's prison bird into my bank?  And lettin' him associate
    with my daughter and&#8212;and . . . Oh, by gracious king!  When I think
    that you knew what he was all along, I&#8212;I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    His anger choked off the rest of the sentence.  Jed rubbed his eyes
    and sat up in his chair.  For the first time since the captain's
    entrance he realized a little of what the latter said.  Before that
    he had been conscious only of his own dull, aching, hopeless misery.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . .  So you've found out, Sam, have you?" he mused.
</p>
<p>
    "Found out!  You bet I've found out!  I only wish to the Lord I'd
    found out months ago, that's all."
</p>
<p>
    "Hum. . . .  Charlie didn't tell you? . . .  No-o, no, he couldn't
    have got back so soon."
</p>
<p>
    "Back be hanged!  I don't know whether he's back or not, blast him.
    But I ain't a fool ALL the time, Jed Winslow, not all the time I
    ain't.  And when I came home tonight and found Maud cryin' to
    herself and no reason for it, so far as I could see, I set out to
    learn that reason.  And I did learn it.  She told me the whole
    yarn, the whole of it.  And I saw the scamp's letter.  And I
    dragged out of her that you&#8212;you had known all the time what he
    was, and had never told me a word. . . .  Oh, how could you, Jed!
    How could you!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's voice was a trifle less listless as he answered.
</p>
<p>
    "It was told me in confidence, Sam," he said.  "I COULDN'T tell
    you.  And, as time went along and I began to see what a fine boy
    Charlie really was, I felt sure 'twould all come out right in the
    end.  And it has, as I see it."
</p>
<p>
"WHAT?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, it's come out all right.  Charlie's gone to fight, same as
    every decent young feller wants to do.  He thinks the world of Maud
    and she does of him, but he was honorable enough not to ask her
    while he worked for you, Sam.  He wrote the letter after he'd gone
    so as to make it easier for her to say no, if she felt like sayin'
    it.  And when he came back from enlistin' he was goin' straight to
    you to make a clean breast of everything.  He's a good boy, Sam.
    He's had hard luck and he's been in trouble, but he's all right and
    I know it.  And you know it, too, Sam Hunniwell.  Down inside you
    you know it, too.  Why, you've told me a hundred times what a fine
    chap Charlie Phillips was and how much you thought of him, and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Hunniwell interrupted.  "Shut up!" he commanded.  "Don't
    talk to me that way!  Don't you dare to!  I did think a lot of him,
    but that was before I knew what he'd done and where he'd been.  Do
    you cal'late I'll let my daughter marry a man that's been in
    state's prison?"
</p>
<p>
    "But, Sam, it wan't all his fault, really.  And he'll go straight
    from this on.  I know he will."
</p>
<p>
    "Shut up!  He can go to the devil from this on, but he shan't take
    her with him. . . .  Why, Jed, you know what Maud is to me.  She's
    all I've got.  She's all I've contrived for and worked for in this
    world.  Think of all the plans I've made for her!"
</p>
<p>
    "I know, Sam, I know; but pretty often our plans don't work out
    just as we make 'em.  Sometimes we have to change 'em&#8212;or give 'em
    up.  And you want Maud to be happy."
</p>
<p>
    "Happy!  I want to be happy myself, don't I?  Do you think I'm
    goin' to give up all my plans and all my happiness just&#8212;just
    because she wants to make a fool of herself?  Give 'em up!  It's
    easy for you to say 'give up.'  What do you know about it?"
</p>
<p>
    It was the last straw.  Jed sprang to his feet so suddenly that his
    chair fell to the floor.
</p>
<p>
    "Know about it!" he burst forth, with such fierce indignation that
    the captain actually gasped in astonishment.  "Know about it!"
    repeated Jed.  "What do I know about givin' up my own plans and&#8212;
    and hopes, do you mean?  Oh, my Lord above!  Ain't I been givin'
    'em up and givin' 'em up all my lifelong?  When I was a boy didn't
    I give up the education that might have made me a&#8212;a MAN instead
    of&#8212;of a town laughin' stock?  While Mother lived was I doin' much
    but give up myself for her?  I ain't sayin' 'twas any more'n right
    that I should, but I did it, didn't I?  And ever since it's been
    the same way.  I tell you, I've come to believe that life for me
    means one 'give up' after the other and won't mean anything but
    that till I die.  And you&#8212;you ask me what I know about it!  YOU
    do!"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam was so taken aback that he was almost speechless.  In
    all his long acquaintance with Jed Winslow he had never seen him
    like this.
</p>
<p>
    "Why&#8212;why, Jed!" he stammered.  But Jed was not listening.  He
    strode across the room and seized his visitor by the arm.
</p>
<p>
    "You go home, Sam Hunniwell," he ordered.  "Go home and think&#8212;
    THINK, I tell you.  All your life you've had just what I haven't.
    You married the girl you wanted and you and she were happy
    together.  You've been looked up to and respected here in Orham;
    folks never laughed at you or called you 'town crank.'  You've got
    a daughter and she's a good girl.  And the man she wants to marry
    is a good man, and, if you'll give him a chance and he lives
    through the war he's goin' into, he'll make you proud of him.  You
    go home, Sam Hunniwell!  Go home, and thank God you're what you are
    and AS you are. . . .  No, I won't talk!  I don't want to talk! . . .
    Go HOME."
</p>
<p>
    He had been dragging his friend to the door.  Now he actually
    pushed him across the threshold and slammed the door between them.
</p>
<p>
    "Well, for . . . the Lord . . . sakes!" exclaimed Captain Hunniwell.
</p>
<p>
    The scraping of the key in the lock was his only answer.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXI
</h2>
<p>
    A child spends time and thought and energy upon the building of a
    house of blocks.  By the time it is nearing completion it has
    become to him a very real edifice.  Therefore, when it collapses
    into an ungraceful heap upon the floor it is poor consolation to be
    reminded that, after all, it was merely a block house and couldn't
    be expected to stand.
</p>
<p>
    Jed, in his own child-like fashion, had reared his moonshine castle
    beam by beam.  At first he had regarded it as moonshine and had
    refused to consider the building of it anything but a dangerously
    pleasant pastime.  And then, little by little, as his dreams
    changed to hopes, it had become more and more real, until, just
    before the end, it was the foundation upon which his future was to
    rest.  And down it came, and there was his future buried in the
    ruins.
</p>
<p>
    And it had been all moonshine from the very first.  Jed, sitting
    there alone in his little living-room, could see now that it had
    been nothing but that.  Ruth Armstrong, young, charming, cultured&#8212;
    could she have thought of linking her life with that of Jedidah
    Edgar Wilfred Winslow, forty-five, "town crank" and builder of
    windmills?  Of course not&#8212;and again of course not.  Obviously she
    never had thought of such a thing.  She had been grateful, that was
    all; perhaps she had pitied him just a little and behind her
    expressions of kindliness and friendship was pity and little else.
    Moonshine&#8212;moonshine&#8212;moonshine.  And, oh, what a fool he had been!
    What a poor, silly fool!
</p>
<p>
    So the night passed and morning came and with it a certain degree
    of bitterly philosophic acceptance of the situation.  He WAS a
    fool; so much was sure.  He was of no use in the world, he never
    had been.  People laughed at him and he deserved to be laughed at.
    He rose from the bed upon which he had thrown himself some time
    during the early morning hours and, after eating a cold mouthful or
    two in lieu of breakfast, sat down at his turning lathe.  He could
    make children's whirligigs, that was the measure of his capacity.
</p>
<p>
    All the forenoon the lathe hummed.  Several times steps sounded on
    the front walk and the latch of the shop door rattled, but Jed did
    not rise from his seat.  He had not unlocked that door, he did not
    mean to for the present.  He did not want to wait on customers; he
    did not want to see callers; he did not want to talk or be talked
    to.  He did not want to think, either, but that he could not help.
</p>
<p>
    And he could not shut out all the callers.  One, who came a little
    after noon, refused to remain shut out.  She pounded the door and
    shouted "Uncle Jed" for some few minutes; then, just as Jed had
    begun to think she had given up and gone away, he heard a thumping
    upon the window pane and, looking up, saw her laughing and nodding
    outside.
</p>
<p>
    "I see you, Uncle Jed," she called.  "Let me in, please."
</p>
<p>
    So Jed was obliged to let her in and she entered with a skip and a
    jump, quite unconscious that her "back-step-uncle" was in any way
    different, either in feelings or desire for her society, than he
    had been for months.
</p>
<p>
    "Why did you have the door locked, Uncle Jed?" she demanded.  "Did
    you forget to unlock it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, without looking at her, muttered something to the effect that
    he cal'lated he must have.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm," she observed, with a nod of comprehension.  "I thought
    that was it.  You did it once before, you know.  It was a ex-eccen-
    trick, leaving it locked was, I guess.  Don't you think it was a&#8212;
    a&#8212;one of those kind of tricks, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Silence, except for the hum and rasp of the lathe.
</p>
<p>
    "Don't you, Uncle Jed?" repeated Barbara.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, yes, I presume likely so."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie, sitting on the lumber pile, kicked her small heels together
    and regarded him with speculative interest.
</p>
<p>
    "Uncle Jed," she said, after a few moments of silent consideration,
    "what do you suppose Petunia told me just now?"
</p>
<p>
    No answer.
</p>
<p>
    "What do you suppose Petunia told me?" repeated Babbie.  "Something
    about you 'twas, Uncle Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Still Jed did not reply.  His silence was not deliberate; he had
    been so absorbed in his own pessimistic musings that he had not
    heard the question, that was all.  Barbara tried again.
</p>
<p>
    "She told me she guessed you had been thinking AWF'LY hard about
    something this time, else you wouldn't have so many eccen-tricks
    to-day."
</p>
<p>
    Silence yet.  Babbie swallowed hard:
</p>
<p>
    "I&#8212;I don't think I like eccen-tricks, Uncle Jed," she faltered.
</p>
<p>
    Not a word.  Then Jed, stooping to pick up a piece of wood from the
    pile of cut stock beside the lathe, was conscious of a little
    sniff.  He looked up.  His small visitor's lip was quivering and
    two big tears were just ready to overflow her lower lashes.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?  . . .  Mercy sakes alive!" he exclaimed.  "Why, what's the
    matter?"
</p>
<p>
    The lip quivered still more.  "I&#8212;I don't like to have you not
    speak to me," sobbed Babbie.  "You&#8212;you never did it so&#8212;so long
    before."
</p>
<p>
    That appeal was sufficient.  Away, for the time, went Jed's
    pessimism and his hopeless musings.  He forgot that he was a fool,
    the "town crank," and of no use in the world.  He forgot his own
    heartbreak, chagrin and disappointment.  A moment later Babbie was
    on his knee, hiding her emotion in the front of his jacket, and he
    was trying his best to soothe her with characteristic Winslow
    nonsense.
</p>
<p>
    "You mustn't mind me, Babbie," he declared.  "My&#8212;my head ain't
    workin' just right to-day, seems so.  I shouldn't wonder if&#8212;if I
    wound it too tight, or somethin' like that."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie's tear-stained face emerged from the jacket front.
</p>
<p>
    "Wound your HEAD too tight, Uncle Jed?" she cried.
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es, yes.  I was kind of extra absent-minded yesterday and I
    thought I wound the clock, but I couldn't have done that 'cause the
    clock's stopped.  Yet I know I wound somethin' and it's just as
    liable to have been my head as anything else.  You listen just back
    of my starboard ear there and see if I'm tickin' reg'lar."
</p>
<p>
    The balance of the conversation between the two was of a distinctly
    personal nature.
</p>
<p>
    "You see, Uncle Jed," said Barbara, as she jumped from his knee
    preparatory to running off to school, "I don't like you to do
    eccen-tricks and not talk to me.  I don't like it at all and
    neither does Petunia.  You won't do any more&#8212;not for so long at a
    time, will you, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "I'll try not to," he said, soberly.
</p>
<p>
    She nodded.  "Of course," she observed, "we shan't mind you doing a
    few, because you can't help that.  But you mustn't sit still and
    not pay attention when we talk for ever and ever so long.  I&#8212;I
    don't know precactly what I and Petunia would do if you wouldn't
    talk to us, Uncle Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "Don't, eh?  Humph!  I presume likely you'd get along pretty well.
    I ain't much account."
</p>
<p>
    Barbara looked at him in horrified surprise.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Uncle Jed!" she cried, "you mustn't talk so!  You MUSTN'T!
    Why&#8212;why, you're the bestest man there is.  And there isn't anybody
    in Orham can make windmills the way you can.  I asked Teacher if
    there was and she said no.  So there!  And you're a GREAT
    cons'lation to all our family," she added, solemnly.  "We just
    couldn't ever&#8212;EVER do without you."
</p>
<p>
    When the child went Jed did not take the trouble to lock the door
    after her; consequently his next callers entered without difficulty
    and came directly to the inner shop.  Jed, once more absorbed in
    gloomy musings&#8212;not quite as gloomy, perhaps; somehow the clouds
    had not descended quite so heavily upon his soul since Babbie's
    visit&#8212;looked up to see there standing behind him Maud Hunniwell
    and Charlie Phillips.
</p>
<p>
    He sprang to his feet.  "Eh?" he cried, delightedly.  "Well, well,
    so you're back, Charlie, safe and sound.  Well, well!"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips grasped the hand which Jed had extended and shook it
    heartily.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I'm back," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm. . . .  And&#8212;er&#8212;how did you leave Uncle Sam?  Old feller's
    pretty busy these days, 'cordin' to the papers."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I imagine he is."
</p>
<p>
    "Um-hm. . . .  Well, did you&#8212;er&#8212;make him happy?  Give his army
    the one thing needful to make it&#8212;er&#8212;perfect?"
</p>
<p>
    Charlie laughed.  "If you mean did I add myself to it," he said, "I
    did.  I am an enlisted man now, Jed.  As soon as Von Hindenburg
    hears that, he'll commit suicide, I'm sure."
</p>
<p>
    Jed insisted on shaking hands with him again.  "You're a lucky
    feller, Charlie," he declared.  "I only wish I had your chance.
    Yes, you're lucky&#8212;in a good many ways," with a glance at Maud.
    "And, speaking of Uncle Sam," he added, "reminds me of&#8212;well, of
    Daddy Sam.  How's he behavin' this mornin'?  I judge from the fact
    that you two are together he's a little more rational than he was
    last night. . . .  Eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Phillips looked puzzled, but Maud evidently understood.  "Daddy has
    been very nice to-day," she said, demurely.  "Charlie had a long
    talk with him and&#8212;and&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "And he was mighty fine," declared Phillips with emphasis.  "We had
    a heart to heart talk and I held nothing back.  I tell you, Jed, it
    did me good to speak the truth, whole and nothing but.  I told
    Captain Hunniwell that I didn't deserve his daughter.  He agreed
    with me there, of course."
</p>
<p>
    "Nonsense!" interrupted Maud, with a happy laugh.
</p>
<p>
    "Not a bit of nonsense.  We agreed that no one was good enough for
    you.  But I told him I wanted that daughter very much indeed and,
    provided she was agreeable and was willing to wait until the war
    was over and I came back; taking it for granted, of course, that I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    He hesitated, bit his lip and looked apprehensively at Miss
    Hunniwell.  Jed obligingly helped him over the thin ice.
</p>
<p>
    "Provided you come back a major general or&#8212;or a commodore or a
    corporal's guard or somethin'," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    "Yes," gratefully, "that's it.  I'm sure to be a high private at
    least.  Well, to cut it short, Jed, I told Captain Hunniwell all my
    past and my hopes and plans for the future.  He was forgiving and
    forbearing and kinder than I had any right to expect.  We
    understand each other now and he is willing, always provided that
    Maud is willing, too, to give me my opportunity to make good.  That
    is all any one could ask."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I should say 'twas. . . .  But Maud, how about her?  You had
    consider'ble of a job makin' her see that you was worth waitin'
    for, I presume likely, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Maud laughed and blushed and bade him behave himself.  Jed demanded
    to be told more particulars concerning the enlisting.  So Charles
    told the story of his Boston trip, while Maud looked and listened
    adoringly, and Jed, watching the young people's happiness, was, for
    the time, almost happy himself.
</p>
<p>
    When they rose to go Charlie laid a hand on Jed's shoulder.
</p>
<p>
    "I can't tell you," he said, "what a brick you've been through all
    this.  If it hadn't been for you, old man, I don't know how it
    might have ended.  We owe you about everything, Maud and I.  You've
    been a wonder, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Jed waved a deprecating hand.  "Don't talk so, Charlie," he said,
    gruffly.
</p>
<p>
    "But, I tell you, I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Don't. . . .  You see," with a twist of the lip, "it don't do to
    tell a&#8212;a screech owl he's a canary.  He's liable to believe it by
    and by and start singin' in public. . . .  Then he finds out he's
    just a fool owl, and has been all along.  Humph!  Me a wonder! . . .
    A blunder, you mean."
</p>
<p>
    Neither of the young people had ever heard him use that tone before.
    They both cried out in protest.
</p>
<p>
    "Look here, Jed&#8212;" began Phillips.
</p>
<p>
    Maud interrupted.  "Just a moment, Charlie," she said.  "Let me
    tell him what Father said last night.  When he went out he left me
    crying and so miserable that I wanted to die.  He had found
    Charlie's letter and we&#8212;we had had a dreadful scene and he had
    spoken to me as I had never heard him speak before.  And, later,
    after he came back I was almost afraid to have him come into the
    room where I was.  But he was just as different as could be.  He
    told me he had been thinking the matter over and had decided that,
    perhaps, he had been unreasonable and silly and cross.  Then he
    said some nice things about Charlie, quite different from what he
    said at first.  And when we had made it all up and I asked him what
    had changed his mind so he told me it was you, Jed.  He said he
    came to you and you put a flea in his ear.  He wouldn't tell me
    what he meant, but he simply smiled and said you had put a flea in
    his ear."
</p>
<p>
    Jed, himself, could not help smiling faintly.
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "I didn't use any sweet ile on the job,
    that's sartin.  If he said I pounded it in with a club 'twouldn't
    have been much exaggeration."
</p>
<p>
    "So we owe you that, too," continued Maud.  "And, afterwards, when
    Daddy and I were talking we agreed that you were probably the best
    man in Orham.  There!"
</p>
<p>
    And she stooped impulsively and kissed him.
</p>
<p>
    Jed, very much embarrassed, shook his head.  "That&#8212;er&#8212;insect I
    put in your pa's ear must have touched both your brains, I
    cal'late," he drawled.  But he was pleased, nevertheless.  If he
    was a fool it was something to have people think him a good sort of
    fool.
</p>
<p>
    It was almost four o'clock when Jed's next visitor came.  He was
    the one man whom he most dreaded to meet just then.  Yet he hid his
    feelings and rose with hand outstretched.
</p>
<p>
    "Why, good afternoon, Major!" he exclaimed.  "Real glad to see you.
    Sit down."
</p>
<p>
    Grover sat.  "Jed," he said, "Ruth tells me that you know of my
    good fortune.  Will you congratulate me?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's reply was calm and deliberate and he did his best to make it
    sound whole-hearted and sincere.
</p>
<p>
    "I sartin do," he declared.  "Anybody that wouldn't congratulate
    you on that could swap his head for a billiard ball and make money
    on the dicker; the ivory he'd get would be better than the bone he
    gave away. . . .  Yes, Major Grover, you're a lucky man."
</p>
<p>
    To save his life he could not entirely keep the shake from his
    voice as he said it.  If Grover noticed it he put it down to the
    sincerity of the speaker.
</p>
<p>
    "Thank you," he said.  "I realize my luck, I assure you.  And now,
    Jed, first of all, let me thank you.  Ruth has told me what a loyal
    friend and counselor you have been to her and she and I both are
    very, very grateful."
</p>
<p>
    Jed stirred uneasily.  "Sho, sho!" he protested.  "I haven't done
    anything.  Don't talk about it, please.  I&#8212;I'd rather you
    wouldn't."
</p>
<p>
    "Very well, since you wish it, I won't.  But she and I will always
    think of it, you may be sure of that.  I dropped in here now just
    to tell you this and to thank you personally.  And I wanted to tell
    you, too, that I think we need not fear Babbitt's talking too much.
    Of course it would not make so much difference now if he did;
    Charlie will be away and doing what all decent people will respect
    him for doing, and you and I can see that Ruth does not suffer.
    But I think Babbitt will keep still.  I hope I have frightened him;
    I certainly did my best."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>
    "I'm kind of sorry for Phin," he observed.
</p>
<p>
    "Are you?  For heaven's sake, why?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I don't know.  When you've been goin' around ever since
    January loaded up to the muzzle with spite and sure-thing
    vengeance, same as an old-fashioned horse pistol used to be loaded
    with powder and ball, it must be kind of hard, just as you're set
    to pull trigger, to have to quit and swaller the whole charge.
    Liable to give you dyspepsy, if nothin' worse, I should say."
</p>
<p>
    Grover smiled.  "The last time I saw Babbitt he appeared to be
    nearer apoplexy than dyspepsia," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es.  Well, I'm sorry for him, I really am.  It must be pretty
    dreadful to be so cross-grained that you can't like even your own
    self without feelin' lonesome. . . .  Yes, that's a bad state of
    affairs. . . .  I don't know but I'd almost rather be 'town crank'
    than that."
</p>
<p>
    The Major's farewell remark, made as he rose to go, contained an
    element of mystery.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall have another matter to talk over with you soon, Jed," he
    said.  "But that will come later, when my plans are more complete.
    Good afternoon and thank you once more.  You've been pretty fine
    through all this secret-keeping business, if you don't mind my
    saying so.  And a mighty true friend.  So true," he added, "that I
    shall, in all probability, ask you to assume another trust for me
    before long.  I can't think of any one else to whom I could so
    safely leave it.  Good-by."
</p>
<p>
    One more visitor came that afternoon.  To be exact, he did not come
    until evening.  He opened the outer door very softly and tiptoed
    into the living-room.  Jed was sitting by the little "gas burner"
    stove, one knee drawn up and his foot swinging.  There was a
    saucepan perched on top of the stove.  A small hand lamp on the
    table furnished the only light.  He did not hear the person who
    entered and when a big hand was laid upon his shoulder he started
    violently.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he exclaimed, his foot falling with a thump to the floor.
    "Who? . . .  Oh, it's you, ain't it, Sam? . . .  Good land, you
    made me jump!  I must be gettin' nervous, I guess."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam looked at him in some surprise.  "Gracious king, I
    believe you are," he observed.  "I didn't think you had any nerves,
    Jed.  No, nor any temper, either, until last night.  You pretty
    nigh blew me out of water then.  Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed was much distressed.  "Sho, sho, Sam," he stammered; "I'm awful
    sorry about that.  I&#8212;I wasn't feelin' exactly&#8212;er&#8212;first rate or I
    wouldn't have talked to you that way.  I&#8212;I&#8212;you know I didn't mean
    it, don't you, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    The captain pulled forward a chair and sat down.  He chuckled.
    "Well, I must say it did sound as if you meant it, Jed," he
    declared.  "Yes, sir, I cal'late the average person would have been
    willin' to risk a small bet&#8212;say a couple of million&#8212;that you
    meant it.  When you ordered me to go home I just tucked my tail
    down and went.  Yes, sir, if you didn't mean it you had ME fooled.
    Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    Jed's distress was keener than ever.  "Mercy sakes alive!" he
    cried.  "Did I tell you to go home, Sam?  Yes, yes, I remember I
    did.  Sho, sho! . . .  Well, I'm awful sorry.  I hope you'll
    forgive me.  'Twan't any way for a feller like me to talk&#8212;to you."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam's big hand fell upon his friend's knee with a stinging
    slap.  "You're wrong there, Jed," he declared, with emphasis.
    "'Twas just the way for you to talk to me.  I needed it; and," with
    another chuckle, "I got it, too, didn't I?  Ho, ho!"
</p>
<p>
    "Sam, I snum, I&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Sshh!  You're goin' to say you're sorry again; I can see it in
    your eye.  Well, don't you do it.  You told me to go home and
    think, Jed, and those were just the orders I needed.  I did go home
    and I did think. . . .  Humph!  Thinkin's a kind of upsettin' job
    sometimes, ain't it, especially when you sit right down and think
    about yourself, what you are compared to what you think you are.
    Ever think about yourself that way, Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    It was a moment before Jed answered.  Then all he said was, "Yes."
</p>
<p>
    "I mean have you done it lately?  Just given yourself right up to
    doin' it?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "Ye-es," he drawled.  "I shouldn't wonder if I had,
    Sam."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, probably 'twan't as disturbin' a job with you as 'twas for
    me.  You didn't have as high a horse to climb down off of.  I
    thought and thought and thought and the more I thought the meaner
    the way I'd acted and talked to Maud seemed to me.  I liked
    Charlie; I'd gone around this county for months braggin' about what
    a smart, able chap he was.  As I told you once I'd rather have had
    her marry him than anybody else I know.  And I had to give in that
    the way he'd behaved&#8212;his goin' off and enlistin', settlin' that
    before he asked her or spoke to me, was a square, manly thing to
    do.  The only thing I had against him was that Middleford mess.
    And I believe he's a GOOD boy in spite of it."
</p>
<p>
    "He is, Sam.  That Middleford trouble wan't all his fault, by any
    means!"
</p>
<p>
    "I know.  He told me this mornin'.  Well, then, if he and Maud love
    each other, thinks I, what right have I to say they shan't be
    happy, especially as they're both willin' to wait?  Why should I
    say he can't at least have his chance to make good?  Nigh's I could
    make out the only reason was my pride and the big plans I'd made
    for my girl.  I came out of my thinkin' spell with my mind made up
    that what ailed me was selfishness and pride.  So I talked it over
    with her last night and with Charlie to-day.  The boy shall have
    his chance.  Both of 'em shall have their chance, Jed.  They're
    happy and&#8212;well, I feel consider'ble better myself.  All else there
    is to do is to just hope to the Lord it turns out right."
</p>
<p>
    "That's about all, Sam.  And I feel pretty sure it's goin' to."
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, I know you do.  Course those big plans of mine that I used to
    make&#8212;her marryin' some rich chap, governor or senator or
    somethin'&#8212;they're all gone overboard.  I used to wish and wish for
    her, like a young-one wishin' on a load of hay, or the first star
    at night, or somethin'.  But if we can't have our wishes, why&#8212;why&#8212;
    then we'll do without 'em.  Eh?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "Sam," he said, "I've been doin' a little
    thinkin' myself. . . .  Ye-es, consider'ble thinkin'. . . .  Fact
    is, seems now as if I hadn't done anything BUT think since the
    world was cranked up and started turnin' over.  And I guess there's
    only one answer.  When we can't have our wishes then it's up to us
    to&#8212;to&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Well, to what?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, to stick to our jobs and grin, that's about all.  'Tain't
    much, I know, especially jobs like some of us have, but it's
    somethin'."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam nodded.  "It's a good deal, Jed," he declared.  "It's
    some stunt to grin&#8212;in these days."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rose slowly to his feet.  He threw back his shoulders with the
    gesture of one determined to rid himself of a burden.
</p>
<p>
    "It is&#8212;it is so, Sam," he drawled.  "But maybe that makes it a
    little more worth while.  What do you think?"
</p>
<p>
    His friend regarded him thoughtfully.  "Jed," he said, "I never saw
    anybody who had the faculty of seein' straight through to the
    common sense inside of things the way you have.  Maud and I were
    talkin' about that last night.  'Go home and think and thank God,'
    you said to me.  And that was what I needed to do.  'Enlist and
    you'll be independent,' you said to Charlie and it set him on the
    road.  'Stick to your job and grin,' you say now.  How do you do
    it, Jed?  Remember one time I told you I couldn't decide whether
    you was a dum fool or a King Solomon?  I know now.  Of the two of
    us I'm nigher to bein' the dum fool; and, by the gracious king, you
    ARE a King Solomon."
</p>
<p>
    Jed slowly shook his head.  "Sam," he said, sadly, "if you knew
    what I know about me you'd . . . but there, you're talkin' wild.  I
    was cal'latin' to have a cup of tea and you'd better have one, too.
    I'm heatin' some water on top of the stove now.  It must be about
    ready."
</p>
<p>
    He lifted the saucepan from the top of the "gas burner" and tested
    the water with his finger.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum," he mused, "it's stone cold.  I can't see why it hasn't het
    faster.  I laid a nice fresh fire, too."
</p>
<p>
    He opened the stove door and looked in.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum . . ." he said, again.  "Yes, yes . . . I laid it but, I&#8212;er&#8212;
    hum . . . I forgot to light it, that's all.  Well, that proves I'm
    King Solomon for sartin.  Probably he did things like that every
    day or so. . . .  Give me a match, will you, Sam?"

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXII
</h2>
<p>
    It had been a chill morning in early spring when Charlie Phillips
    went to Boston to enlist.  Now it was a balmy evening in August and
    Jed sat upon a bench by his kitchen door looking out to sea.  The
    breeze was light, barely sufficient to turn the sails of the little
    mills, again so thickly sprinkled about the front yard, or to cause
    the wooden sailors to swing their paddles.  The August moon was
    rising gloriously behind the silver bar of the horizon.  From the
    beach below the bluff came the light laughter of a group of summer
    young folk, strolling from the hotel to the post-office by the
    shore route.
</p>
<p>
    Babbie, who had received permission to sit up and see the moon
    rise, was perched upon the other end of the bench, Petunia in her
    arms.  A distant drone, which had been audible for some time, was
    gradually becoming a steady humming roar.  A few moments later and
    a belated hydro-aeroplane passed across the face of the moon, a
    dragon-fly silhouette against the shining disk.
</p>
<p>
    "That bumble-bee's gettin' home late," observed Jed.  "The rest of
    the hive up there at East Harniss have gone to roost two or three
    hours ago.  Wonder what kept him out this scandalous hour.  Had
    tire trouble, think?"
</p>
<p>
    Barbara laughed.
</p>
<p>
    "You're joking again, Uncle Jed," she said.  "That kind of
    aeroplane couldn't have any tire trouble, 'cause it hasn't got any
    tires."
</p>
<p>
    Mr. Winslow appeared to reflect.  "That's so," he admitted, "but I
    don't know as we'd ought to count too much on that.  I remember
    when Gabe Bearse had brain fever."
</p>
<p>
    This was a little deep for Babbie, whose laugh was somewhat
    uncertain.  She changed the subject.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh!" she cried, with a wiggle, "there's a caterpillar right here
    on this bench with us, Uncle Jed.  He's a fuzzy one, too; I can see
    the fuzz; the moon makes it shiny."
</p>
<p>
    Jed bent over to look.  "That?" he said.  "That little, tiny one?
    Land sakes, he ain't big enough to be more than a kitten-pillar.
    You ain't afraid of him, are you?"
</p>
<p>
    "No-o.  No, I guess I'm not.  But I shouldn't like to have him walk
    on me.  He'd be so&#8212;so ticklesome."
</p>
<p>
    Jed brushed the caterpillar off into the grass.
</p>
<p>
    "There he goes," he said.  "I've got to live up to my job as
    guardian, I expect.  Last letter I had from your pa he said he
    counted on my lookin' out for you and your mamma.  If he thought I
    let ticklesome kitten-pillars come walkin' on you he wouldn't
    cal'late I amounted to much."
</p>
<p>
    For this was the "trust" to which Major Grover had referred in his
    conversation with Jed.  Later he explained his meaning.  He was
    expecting soon to be called to active service "over there."  Before
    he went he and Ruth were to be married.
</p>
<p>
    "My wife and Barbara will stay here in the old house, Jed," he
    said, "if you are willing.  And I shall leave them in your charge.
    It's a big trust, for they're pretty precious articles, but they'll
    be safe with you."
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked at him aghast.  "Good land of love!" he cried.  "You
    don't mean it?"
</p>
<p>
    "Of course I mean it.  Don't look so frightened, man.  It's just
    what you've been doing ever since they came here, that's all.  Ruth
    says she has been going to you for advice since the beginning.  I
    just want her to keep on doing it."
</p>
<p>
    "But&#8212;but, my soul, I&#8212;I ain't fit to be anybody's guardian. . . .
    I&#8212;I ought to have somebody guardin' me.  Anybody'll tell you
    that. . . .  Besides, I&#8212;I don't think&#8212;"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, you do; and you generally think right.  Oh, come, don't talk
    any more about it.  It's a bargain, of course.  And if there's
    anything I can do for you on the other side, I'll be only too happy
    to oblige."
</p>
<p>
    Jed rubbed his chin.  "W-e-e-ll," he drawled, "there's one triflin'
    thing I've been hankerin' to do myself, but I can't, I'm afraid.
    Maybe you can do it for me."
</p>
<p>
    "All right, what is the trifling thing?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, that&#8212;er&#8212;-Crown Prince thing.  Do him brown, if
    you get a chance, will you?"
</p>
<p>
    Of course, the guardianship was, in a sense, a joke, but in another
    it was not.  Jed knew that Leonard Grover's leaving his wife and
    Babbie in his charge was, to a certain extent, a serious trust.
    And he accepted it as such.
</p>
<p>
    "Has your mamma had any letters from the major the last day or so?"
    he inquired.
</p>
<p>
    Babbie shook her head.  "No," she said, "but she's expecting one
    every day.  And Petunia and I expect one, too, and we're just as
    excited about it as we can be.  A letter like that is most par-
    particklesome exciting. . . .  No, I don't mean particklesome&#8212;it
    was the caterpillar made me think of that.  I mean partickle-ar
    exciting.  Don't you think it is, Uncle Jed?"
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam Hunniwell came strolling around the corner of the shop.
    Jed greeted him warmly and urged him to sit down.  The captain
    declined.
</p>
<p>
    "Can't stop," he declared.  "There's a letter for Maud from Charlie
    in to-night's mail and I want to take it home to her.  Letters like
    that can't be held up on the way, you know."
</p>
<p>
    Charlie Phillips, too, was in France with his regiment.
</p>
<p>
    "I presume likely you've heard the news from Leander Babbitt, Jed?"
    asked Captain Sam.
</p>
<p>
    "About his bein' wounded?  Yes, Gab flapped in at the shop this
    afternoon to caw over it.  Said the telegram had just come to
    Phineas.  I was hopin' 'twasn't so, but Eri Hedge said he heard it,
    too. . . .  Serious, is it, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "They don't say, but I shouldn't wonder.  The boy was hit by a
    shell splinter while doin' his duty with exceptional bravery, so
    the telegram said.  'Twas from Washin'ton, of course.  And there
    was somethin' in it about his bein' recommended for one of those
    war crosses."
</p>
<p>
    Jed sat up straight on the bench.  "You don't mean it!" he cried.
    "Well, well, well!  Ain't that splendid!  I knew he'd do it, too.
    'Twas in him.  Sam," he added, solemnly, "did I tell you I got a
    letter from him last week?"
</p>
<p>
    "From Leander?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes. . . .  And before I got it he must have been wounded. . . .
    Yes, sir, before I got his letter. . . .  'Twas a good letter, Sam,
    a mighty good letter.  Some time I'll read it to you.  Not a
    complaint in it, just cheerfulness, you know, and&#8212;and grit and
    confidence, but no brag."
</p>
<p>
    "I see.  Well, Charlie writes the same way."
</p>
<p>
    "Ye-es.  They all do, pretty much.  Well, how about Phineas?  How
    does the old feller take the news?  Have you heard?"
</p>
<p>
    "Why, yes, I've heard.  Of course I haven't talked with him.  He'd
    no more speak to me than he would to the Evil One."
</p>
<p>
    Jed's lip twitched.  "Why, probably not quite so quick, Sam," he
    drawled.  "Phin ought to be on pretty good terms with the Old
    Scratch.  I've heard him recommend a good many folks to go to him."
</p>
<p>
    "Ho, ho!  Yes, that's so.  Well, Jim Bailey told me that when Phin
    had read the telegram he never said a word.  Just got up and walked
    into his back shop.  But Jerry Burgess said that, later on, at the
    post-office somebody said somethin' about how Leander must be a
    mighty good fighter to be recommended for that cross, and Phineas
    was openin' his mail box and heard 'em.  Jerry says old Phin turned
    and snapped out over his shoulder: 'Why not?  He's my son, ain't
    he?'  So there you are.  Maybe that's pride, or cussedness, or
    both.  Anyhow, it's Phin Babbitt."
</p>
<p>
    As the captain was turning to go he asked his friend a question.
</p>
<p>
    "Jed," he asked, "what in the world have you taken your front gate
    off the hinges for?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed, who had been gazing dreamily out to sea for the past few
    minutes, started and came to life.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh?" he queried.  "Did&#8212;did you speak, Sam?"
</p>
<p>
    "Yes, but you haven't yet.  I asked you what you took your front
    gate off the hinges for."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, I didn't.  I took the hinges off the gate."
</p>
<p>
    "Well, it amounts to the same thing.  The gate's standin' up
    alongside the fence.  What did you do it for?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed sighed.  "It squeaked like time," he drawled, "and I had to
    stop it."
</p>
<p>
    "So you took the hinges off?  Gracious king!  Why didn't you ile
    'em so they wouldn't squeak?"
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  Oh, I did set out to, but I couldn't find the ile can.
    The only thing I could find was the screwdriver and at last I came
    to the conclusion the Almighty must have meant me to use it; so I
    did.  Anyhow, it stopped the squeakin'."
</p>
<p>
    Captain Sam roared delightedly.  "That's fine," he declared.  "It
    does me good to have you act that way.  You haven't done anything
    so crazy as that for the last six months.  I believe the old Jed
    Winslow's come back again.  That's fine."
</p>
<p>
    Jed smiled his slow smile.  "I'm stickin' to my job, Sam," he said.
</p>
<p>
    "And grinnin'.  Don't forget to grin, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    "W-e-e-ll, when I stick to MY job, Sam, 'most everybody grins."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie accompanied the captain to the place where the gate had
    been.  Jed, left alone, hummed a hymn.  The door of the little
    house next door opened and Ruth came out into the yard.
</p>
<p>
    "Where is Babbie?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "She's just gone as far as the sidewalk with Cap'n Sam Hunniwell,"
    was Jed's reply.  "She's all right.  Don't worry about her."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth laughed lightly.  "I don't," she said.  "I know she is all
    right when she is with you, Jed."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie came dancing back.  Somewhere in a distant part of the
    village a dog was howling dismally.
</p>
<p>
    "What makes that dog bark that way, Uncle Jed?" asked Babbie.
</p>
<p>
    Jed was watching Ruth, who had walked to the edge of the bluff and
    was looking off over the water, her delicate face and slender
    figure silver-edged by the moonlight.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh? . . .  That dog?" he repeated.  "Oh, he's barkin' at the moon,
    I shouldn't wonder."
</p>
<p>
    "At the moon?  Why does he bark at the moon?"
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, he thinks he wants it, I cal'late.  Wants it to eat or play
    with or somethin'.  Dogs get funny notions, sometimes."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie laughed.  "I, think he's awf'ly silly," she said.  "He
    couldn't have the moon, you know, could he?  The moon wasn't made
    for a dog."
</p>
<p>
    Jed, still gazing at Ruth, drew a long breath.
</p>
<p>
    "That's right," he admitted.
</p>
<p>
    The child listened to the lugubrious canine wails for a moment;
    then she said thoughtfully: "I feel kind of sorry for this poor
    dog, though.  He sounds as if he wanted the moon just dreadf'ly."
</p>
<p>
    "Um . . . yes . . . I presume likely he thinks he does.  But he'll
    feel better about it by and by.  He'll realize that, same as you
    say, the moon wasn't made for a dog.  Just as soon as he comes to
    that conclusion, he'll be a whole lot better dog. . . .  Yes, and a
    happier one, too," he added, slowly.
</p>
<p>
    Barbara did not speak at once and Jed began to whistle a doleful
    melody.  Then the former declared, with emphasis: "I think SOME
    dogs are awf'ly nice."
</p>
<p>
    "Um? . . .  What? . . .  Oh, you do, eh?"
</p>
<p>
    She snuggled close to him on the bench.
</p>
<p>
    "I think you're awf'ly nice, too, Uncle Jed," she confided.
</p>
<p>
    Jed looked down at her over his spectacles.
</p>
<p>
    "Sho! . . .  Bow, wow!" he observed.
</p>
<p>
    Babbie burst out laughing.  Ruth turned and came toward them over
    the dew-sprinkled grass.
</p>
<p>
    "What are you laughing at, dear?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, Uncle Jed was so funny.  He was barking like a dog."
</p>
<p>
    Ruth smiled.  "Perhaps he feels as if he were our watchdog,
    Babbie," she said.  "He guards us as if he were."
</p>
<p>
    Babbie hugged her back-step-uncle's coat sleeve.
</p>
<p>
    "He's a great, big, nice old watchdog," she declared.  "We love
    him, don't we, Mamma?"
</p>
<p>
    Jed turned his head to listen.
</p>
<p>
    "Hum . . ." he drawled.  "That dog up town has stopped his howlin'.
    Perhaps he's beginnin' to realize what a lucky critter he is."
</p>
<p>
    As usual, Babbie was ready with a question.
</p>
<p>
    "Why is he lucky, Uncle Jed?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
    "Why?  Oh, well, he . . . he can LOOK at the moon, and that's
    enough to make any dog thankful."

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
