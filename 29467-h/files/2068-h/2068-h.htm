    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH HEARS TWO PROPOSALS AND THE BEGINNING OF A THIRD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Trumet in a fog; a fog blown in during the night by the wind from the wide
      Atlantic. So wet and heavy that one might taste the salt in it. So thick
      that houses along the main road were but dim shapes behind its gray
      drapery, and only the gates and fences of the front yards were plainly in
      evidence to the passers-by. The beach plum and bayberry bushes on the
      dunes were spangled with beady drops. The pole on Cannon Hill, where the
      beacon was hoisted when the packet from Boston dropped anchor in the bay,
      was shiny and slippery. The new weathervane, a gilded whale, presented to
      the &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; church by Captain Zebedee Mayo, retired whaler, swam in a
      sea of cloud. The lichened eaves of the little &ldquo;Come-Outer&rdquo; chapel dripped
      at sedate intervals. The brick walk leading to the door of Captain Elkanah
      Daniels&rsquo;s fine residence held undignified puddles in its hollows. And,
      through the damp stillness, the muttered growl of the surf, three miles
      away at the foot of the sandy bluffs by the lighthouse, sounded ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly opposite Captain Elkanah&rsquo;s front gate, on the other side of the
      main road, stood the little story-and-a-half house, also the captain&rsquo;s
      property, which for fourteen years had been tenanted by Mrs. Keziah Coffin
      and her brother, Solomon Hall, the shoemaker. But Solomon had, the month
      before, given up his fight with debt and illness and was sleeping quietly
      in Trumet&rsquo;s most populous center, the graveyard. And Keziah, left alone,
      had decided that the rent and living expenses were more than her
      precarious earnings as a seamstress would warrant, and, having bargained
      with the furniture dealer in Wellmouth for the sale of her household
      effects, was now busy getting them ready for the morrow, when the dealer&rsquo;s
      wagon was to call. She was going to Boston, where a distant and
      condescending rich relative had interested himself to the extent of
      finding her a place as sewing woman in a large tailoring establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog hung like a wet blanket over the house and its small yard, where a
      few venerable pear trees, too conservative in their old age to venture a
      bud even though it was almost May, stood bare and forlorn. The day was
      dismal. The dismantled dining room, its tables and chairs pushed into a
      corner, and its faded ingrain carpet partially stripped from the floor,
      was dismal, likewise. Considering all things, one might have expected
      Keziah herself to be even more dismal. But, to all outward appearances,
      she was not. A large portion of her thirty-nine years of life had been
      passed under a wet blanket, so to speak, and she had not permitted the
      depressing covering to shut out more sunshine than was absolutely
      necessary. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get cream, you might as well learn to love your
      sasser of skim milk,&rdquo; said practical Keziah.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was on her knees, her calico dress sleeves, patched and darned, but
      absolutely clean, rolled back, uncovering a pair of plump, strong arms, a
      saucer of tacks before her, and a tack hammer with a claw head in her
      hand. She was taking up the carpet. Grace Van Horne, Captain Eben
      Hammond&rsquo;s ward, who had called to see if there was anything she might do
      to help, was removing towels, tablecloths, and the like from the drawers
      in a tall &ldquo;high-boy,&rdquo; folding them and placing them in an old and battered
      trunk. The pair had been discussing the subject which all Trumet had
      discussed for three weeks, namely, the &ldquo;calling&rdquo; to the pastorate of the
      &ldquo;Regular&rdquo; church of the Rev. John Ellery, the young divinity student, who
      was to take the place of old Parson Langley, minister in the parish for
      over thirty years. Discussion in the village had now reached a critical
      point, for the Reverend John was expected by almost any coach. In those
      days, the days of the late fifties, the railroad down the Cape extended
      only as far as Sandwich; passengers made the rest of their journey by
      stage. Many came direct from the city by the packet, the little schooner,
      but Mr. Ellery had written that he should probably come on the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s very nice-looking,&rdquo; remarked Miss Van Horne soberly, but
      with a MISCHIEVOUS glance under her dark lashes at Keziah. The lady
      addressed paused long enough to transfer several tacks from the floor to
      the saucer, and then made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;A good many years ago I saw a theater show up to
      Boston. Don&rsquo;t be shocked; those circumstances we hear so much tell of&mdash;the
      kind you can&rsquo;t control&mdash;have kept me from goin&rsquo; to theaters much,
      even if I wanted to. But I did see this entertainment, and a fool one
      &lsquo;twas, too, all singin&rsquo; instead of talkin&rsquo;&mdash;op&rsquo;ra, I believe they
      called it. Well, as I started to say, one of the leadin&rsquo; folks in it was
      the Old Harry himself, and HE was pretty good-lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace laughed, even though she had been somewhat shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Aunt Keziah!&rdquo; she exclaimed&mdash;those who knew Keziah Coffin best
      usually called her aunt, though real nephews and nieces she had none&mdash;&ldquo;why,
      Aunt Keziah! What do you mean by comparing the&mdash;the person you just
      mentioned with a MINISTER!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t comparin&rsquo; &lsquo;em; I&rsquo;ll leave that for you Come-Outers to do.
      Drat this carpet! Seems&rsquo;s if I never saw such long tacks; I do believe
      whoever put &lsquo;em down drove &lsquo;em clean through the center of the earth and
      let the Chinymen clinch &lsquo;em on t&rsquo;other side. I haul up a chunk of the
      cellar floor with every one. Ah, hum!&rdquo; with a sigh, &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late they ain&rsquo;t
      any more anxious to leave home than I am. But, far&rsquo;s the minister&rsquo;s
      concerned, didn&rsquo;t I hear of your Uncle Eben sayin&rsquo; in prayer meetin&rsquo; only
      a fortni&rsquo;t or so ago that all hands who wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t Come-Outers were own
      children to Satan? Mr. Ellery must take after his father some. Surprisin&rsquo;,
      ain&rsquo;t it, what a family the old critter&rsquo;s got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed again. For one brought up, since her seventh year, in the
      strictest of Come-Outer families, she laughed a good deal. Many
      Come-Outers considered it wicked to laugh. Yet Grace did it, and hers was
      a laugh pleasant to hear and distinctly pleasant to see. It made her
      prettier than ever, a fact which, if she was aware of it, should have been
      an additional preventive, for to be pretty smacks of vanity. Perhaps she
      wasn&rsquo;t aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think Uncle Eben would say if he heard that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say I took after my father, too, I presume likely. Does your uncle know
      you come here to see me so often? And call me &lsquo;aunt&rsquo; and all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he does. Aunt Keziah, you mustn&rsquo;t think Uncle Eben doesn&rsquo;t see
      the good in people simply because they don&rsquo;t believe as he does. He&rsquo;s as
      sweet and kind as&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Eben Hammond? Land sakes, child, don&rsquo;t I know it? Cap&rsquo;n Eben&rsquo;s the
      salt of the earth. I&rsquo;m a Regular and always have been, but I&rsquo;d be glad if
      my own society was seasoned with a few like him. &lsquo;Twould taste better to
      me of a Sunday.&rdquo; She paused, and then added quizzically: &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you
      s&rsquo;pose Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah and the rest of our parish committee would say if
      they heard THAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows! Still, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say it. And uncle says you
      are as good a woman as ever lived. He thinks you&rsquo;re misled, of course, but
      that some day you&rsquo;ll see the error of your ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;ll have to hurry up if I want to see &lsquo;em without spectacles. See
      my errors! Land sakes! much as I can do to see the heads of these tacks.
      Takin&rsquo; up carpets is as hard a test of a body&rsquo;s eyesight as &lsquo;tis of their
      religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion put down the tablecloth she was folding and looked earnestly
      at the other woman. To an undiscerning eye the latter would have looked
      much as she always did&mdash;plump and matronly, with brown hair drawn
      back from the forehead and parted in the middle; keen brown eyes with a
      humorous twinkle in them&mdash;this was the Keziah Coffin the later
      generation of Trumet knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Grace Van Horne, who called her aunt and came to see her so
      frequently, while her brother was alive and during the month following his
      death, could see the changes which the month had wrought. She saw the
      little wrinkles about the eyes and the lines of care about the mouth, the
      tired look of the whole plucky, workaday New England figure. She shook her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religion!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I do believe, Aunt Keziah, that you&rsquo;ve got the
      very best religion of anybody I know. I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t belong to
      our church. When I see how patient you&rsquo;ve been and how cheerful through
      all your troubles, it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin waved the hammer deprecatingly. &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; she
      interrupted. &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; away. Here&rsquo;s you and I
      praisin&rsquo; up each other&rsquo;s beliefs, just as if that wasn&rsquo;t a crime here in
      Trumet. Sometimes when I see how the two societies in this little
      one-horse place row with each other, I declare if it doesn&rsquo;t look as if
      they&rsquo;d crossed out the first word of &lsquo;Love your neighbor&rsquo; and wrote in
      &lsquo;Fight,&rsquo; instead. Yet I&rsquo;m a pretty good Regular, too, and when it comes to
      whoopin&rsquo; and carryin&rsquo; on like the Come-Outers, I&mdash;Well! well! never
      mind; don&rsquo;t begin to bristle up. I won&rsquo;t say another word about religion.
      Let&rsquo;s pick the new minister to pieces. ANY kind of a Christian can do
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the new minister was destined to remain undissected that morning, in
      that house at least. Grace was serious now and she voiced the matter which
      had been uppermost in her mind since she left home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why do you go away? What makes you? Is it
      absolutely necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do I go? Why, for the same reason that the feller that was hove
      overboard left the ship&mdash;cause I can&rsquo;t stay. You&rsquo;ve got to have
      vittles and clothes, even in Trumet, and a place to put your head in
      nights. Long&rsquo;s Sol was alive and could do his cobblin&rsquo; we managed to get
      along somehow. What I could earn sewin&rsquo; helped, and we lived simple. But
      when he was taken down and died, the doctor&rsquo;s bills and the undertaker&rsquo;s
      used up what little money I had put by, and the sewin&rsquo; alone wouldn&rsquo;t keep
      a healthy canary in bird seed. Dear land knows I hate to leave the old
      house I&rsquo;ve lived in for fourteen years and the town I was born in, but
      I&rsquo;ve got to, for all I see. Thank mercy, I can pay Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah his last
      month&rsquo;s rent and go with a clear conscience. I won&rsquo;t owe anybody, that&rsquo;s a
      comfort, and nobody will owe me; though I could stand that, I guess,&rdquo; she
      added, prying at the carpet edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s dark eyes flashed indignantly. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s
      too bad of Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah to turn you out when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way. He ain&rsquo;t turnin&rsquo; me out. He ain&rsquo;t lettin&rsquo; houses for
      his health and he&rsquo;ll need the money to buy his daughter&rsquo;s summer rigs. She
      ain&rsquo;t had a new dress for a month, pretty near, and here&rsquo;s a young and
      good-lookin&rsquo; parson heavin&rsquo; in sight. Maybe Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah would think a
      minister was high-toned enough even for Annabel to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only twenty-three, they say,&rdquo; remarked Grace, a trifle maliciously.
      &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll adopt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annabel was the only child of Captain Elkanah Daniels, who owned the
      finest house in town. She was the belle of Trumet, and had been for a good
      many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;anyhow I&rsquo;ve got to go. Maybe I&rsquo;ll like Boston first
      rate, you can&rsquo;t tell. Or maybe I won&rsquo;t. Ah, hum! &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be the first
      thing I&rsquo;ve had to do that I didn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want to make a proposal to you, and you mustn&rsquo;t be
      cross about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A proposal! Sakes alive! What&rsquo;ll I say? &lsquo;This is so sudden!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what
      Becky Ryder, up to the west part of the town, said when Jim Baker, the tin
      peddler, happened to ask her if she&rsquo;d ever thought of gettin&rsquo; married. &lsquo;O
      James! this is so sudden!&rsquo; says Becky. Jim said afterwards that the
      suddenest thing about it was the way he cleared out of that house. And he
      never called there afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace smiled, but quickly grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, auntie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please listen. I&rsquo;m in earnest. It seems to me
      that you might do quite well at dressmaking here in town, if you had a
      little&mdash;well, ready money to help you at the start. I&rsquo;ve got a few
      hundred dollars in the bank, presents from uncle, and my father&rsquo;s
      insurance money. I should love to lend it to you, and I know uncle would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s foot!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t got where I need to borrow
      money yet a while. Thank you just as much, deary, but long&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve got two
      hands and a mouth, I&rsquo;ll make the two keep t&rsquo;other reasonably full, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t wonder. No, I shan&rsquo;t think of it, so don&rsquo;t say another word. NO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The negative was so decided that Grace was silenced. Her disappointment
      showed in her face, however, and Keziah hastened to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but what my goin&rsquo; to Boston may be the
      best thing that ever happened to me? You can&rsquo;t tell. No use despairin&rsquo;,
      Annabel ain&rsquo;t given up hope yet; why should I? Hey? Ain&rsquo;t that somebody
      comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion sprang to her feet and ran to the window. Then she broke
      into a smothered laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Kyan Pepper!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He must be coming to see you,
      Aunt Keziah. And he&rsquo;s got on his very best Sunday clothes. Gracious! I
      must be going. I didn&rsquo;t know you expected callers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah dropped the tack hammer and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kyan!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What in the world is that old idiot comin&rsquo; here
      for? To talk about the minister, I s&rsquo;pose. How on earth did Laviny ever
      come to let him out alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper, Mr. Abishai Pepper, locally called &ldquo;Kyan&rdquo; (Cayenne) Pepper
      because of his red hair and thin red side whiskers, was one of Trumet&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;characters,&rdquo; and in his case the character was weak. He was born in the
      village and, when a youngster, had, like every other boy of good family in
      the community, cherished ambitions for a seafaring life. His sister,
      Lavinia, ten years older than he, who, after the death of their parents,
      had undertaken the job of &ldquo;bringing up&rdquo; her brother, did not sympathize
      with these ambitions. Consequently, when Kyan ran away she followed him to
      Boston, stalked aboard the vessel where he had shipped, and collared him,
      literally and figuratively. One of the mates venturing to offer objection,
      Lavinia turned upon him and gave him a piece of her mind, to the immense
      delight of the crew and the loungers on the wharf. Then she returned with
      the vagrant to Trumet. Old Captain Higgins, who skippered the packet in
      those days, swore that Lavinia never stopped lecturing her brother from
      the time they left Boston until they dropped anchor behind the breakwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word that &lsquo;twas pretty nigh a stark calm, but there was
      such a steady stream of language pourin&rsquo; out of the Pepper stateroom that
      the draught kept the sails filled all the way home,&rdquo; asserted Captain
      Higgins.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Kyan&rsquo;s sole venture, so far as sailoring was concerned, but he
      ran away again when he was twenty-five. This time he returned of his own
      accord, bringing a wife with him, one Evelyn Gott of Ostable. Evelyn could
      talk a bit herself, and her first interview with Lavinia ended with the
      latter&rsquo;s leaving the house in a rage, swearing never to set foot in it
      again. This oath she broke the day of her sister-in-law&rsquo;s funeral. Then
      she appeared, after the ceremony, her baggage on the wagon with her. The
      bereaved one, who was sitting on the front stoop of his dwelling with, so
      people say, a most resigned expression on his meek countenance, looked up
      and saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My land! Laviny,&rdquo; he exclaimed, turning pale. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind WHERE I come from,&rdquo; observed his sister promptly. &ldquo;You just be
      thankful I&rsquo;ve come. If ever a body needed some one to take care of &lsquo;em,
      it&rsquo;s you. You can tote my things right in,&rdquo; she added, turning to her
      grinning driver, &ldquo;and you, &lsquo;Bishy, go right in with &lsquo;em. The idea of your
      settin&rsquo; outside takin&rsquo; it easy when your poor wife ain&rsquo;t been buried
      more&rsquo;n an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;Laviny,&rdquo; protested poor Kyan, speaking the truth
      unwittingly, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take it easy AFORE she was buried, could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go right in,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;March!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abishai marched, and had marched under his sister&rsquo;s orders ever since. She
      kept house for him, and did it well, but her one fear was that some female
      might again capture him, and she watched him with an eagle eye. He was the
      town assessor and tax collector, but when he visited dwellings containing
      single women or widows, Lavinia always accompanied him, &ldquo;to help him in
      his figgerin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, when he appeared, unchaperoned, on the walk leading to the
      side door of the Coffin homestead, Keziah and her friend were surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dressed to kill,&rdquo; whispered Grace, at the window. &ldquo;Even his tall
      hat; and in this fog! I do believe he&rsquo;s coming courting, Aunt Keziah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was the ungracious answer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to say good-by, I s&rsquo;pose,
      and to find out where I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; and how much pay I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to get and if
      my rent&rsquo;s settled, and a few other little things that ain&rsquo;t any of his
      business. Laviny put him up to it, you see. She&rsquo;ll be along pretty quick.
      Well, I&rsquo;ll fix him so he won&rsquo;t talk much. He can help us take down that
      stovepipe. I said &lsquo;twas a job for a man, and a half one&rsquo;s better than none&mdash;Why,
      how d&rsquo;ye do, &lsquo;Bishy? Come right in. Pretty thick outside, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper entered diffidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;how d&rsquo;ye do, Keziah?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just
      run in a minute and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Glad to see you. Take off your hat. My sakes! it&rsquo;s pretty wet.
      How did Laviny come to let you&mdash;I mean how&rsquo;d you come to wear a
      beaver such a mornin&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan removed the silk hat and inspected its limp grandeur ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Well, the fact is, I come out by myself. You
      see, Laviny&rsquo;s gone up to Sarah B.&lsquo;s to talk church doin&rsquo;s. I&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      I kind of wanted to speak with you about somethin&rsquo;, Keziah, so&mdash;Oh! I
      didn&rsquo;t see you, Gracie. Good mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t seem overjoyed to see Miss Van Horne, as it was. In fact, he
      reddened perceptibly and backed toward the door. The girl, her eyes
      twinkling, took up her jacket and hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m not going to stop, Mr. Pepper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was only helping
      Aunt Keziah a little, that&rsquo;s all. I must run on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run on&mdash;nonsense!&rdquo; declared Keziah decisively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay
      right here and help us get that stovepipe down. And &lsquo;Bishy&rsquo;ll help, too.
      Won&rsquo;t you, &lsquo;Bish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stovepipe was attached to the &ldquo;air-tight&rdquo; in the dining room. It&mdash;the
      pipe&mdash;rose perpendicularly for a few feet and then extended
      horizontally, over the high-boy, until it entered the wall. Kyan looked at
      it and then at his &ldquo;Sunday clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d be glad to, of course,&rdquo; he declared with dubious enthusiasm.
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll have time. Perhaps I&rsquo;d better come later and do
      it. Laviny, she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Laviny can spare you for a few minutes, I guess; &lsquo;specially as she
      don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re out. Better take your coat off, hadn&rsquo;t you? Grace, fetch
      one of those chairs for Ky&mdash;for &lsquo;Bishy to stand in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace obediently brought the chair. It happened to be the one with a
      rickety leg, but its owner was helping the reluctant Abishai remove the
      long-tailed blue coat which had been his wedding garment and had adorned
      his person on occasions of ceremony ever since. She did not notice the
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real good of you to offer to help,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Grace and I didn&rsquo;t
      hardly dast to try it alone. That pipe&rsquo;s been up so long that I wouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder if &lsquo;twas chock-full of soot. If you&rsquo;re careful, though, I don&rsquo;t
      believe you&rsquo;ll get any on you. Never mind the floor; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to wash
      that before I leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, slowly, the unwilling Mr. Pepper suffered himself to be led
      to the chair. He mounted it and gingerly took hold of the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better loosen it at the stove hole first,&rdquo; advised Keziah. &ldquo;What was it
      you wanted to see me about, &lsquo;Bish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the hasty response. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; of any account&mdash;that
      is to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned redder than ever and wrenched at the pipe. It loosened at its
      lower end and the wires holding it in suspension shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; observed the lady of the house, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;d better move that
      chest of drawers out so&rsquo;s you can get behind it. Grace, you help me.
      There! that&rsquo;s better. Now move your chair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan stepped from the chair and moved the latter to a position between the
      high-boy and the wall. Then he remounted and gripped the pipe in the
      middle of its horizontal section.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to stick in the chimney there, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; queried Keziah. &ldquo;Wiggle
      it back and forth; that ought to loosen it. What was it you wanted to say,
      &lsquo;Bish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, Mr. Pepper had nothing to say. The crimson tide had reached
      his ears, which, always noticeable because of their size and spread, were
      now lit up like a schooner&rsquo;s sails at sunset. His hands trembled on the
      pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;, I tell you,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I just run in to say
      how d&rsquo;ye do, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I think I&rsquo;d better be going,&rdquo; said Grace, glancing from Kyan&rsquo;s
      embarrassed face to that of the unsuspecting Mrs. Coffin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m
      in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; shouted the occupant of the chair. &ldquo;No, no, you ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I am. And they&rsquo;ll be expecting me at home. Aunt Keziah, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry,&rdquo; interrupted Keziah. &ldquo;Does stick in the
      chimney, don&rsquo;t it? Tell you what you can do, Grace; you can go in the
      woodshed and fetch the hammer that&rsquo;s in the table drawer. Hurry up, that&rsquo;s
      a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan protested that he did not need the hammer, but his protest was
      unheeded. With one more glance at the couple, Grace departed from the
      kitchen, biting her lips. She shut the door carefully behind her. Mr.
      Pepper labored frantically with the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use to shake it any more till you get the hammer,&rdquo; advised Keziah.
      &ldquo;Might&rsquo;s well talk while you&rsquo;re waitin&rsquo;. What was it you wanted to tell
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abishai drew one hand across his forehead, leaving a decorative smooch of
      blacking on his perspiring countenance. He choked, swallowed, and then,
      with a look at the closed door, seemed to reach a desperate resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he whispered hurriedly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve known me quite a spell, ain&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Known you? Known you ever since you were born, pretty nigh. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. And I&rsquo;ve known you, you know. Fact is, we&rsquo;ve known each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the man! Land sakes! don&rsquo;t everybody in Trumet know everybody else?
      What ARE you drivin&rsquo; at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah, you&rsquo;re a single woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion let go of the chair, which she had been holding in place,
      and stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a single woman?&rdquo; she repeated sharply. &ldquo;What do you mean by that? Did&mdash;did
      anybody say I wasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! &lsquo;Course not. But you&rsquo;re a widow, so you BE single, you know, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Did you think I was twins? Get down off there this minute. You&rsquo;ve
      gone crazy. I thought so when I saw that beaver. Either that or you&rsquo;ve
      been drinkin&rsquo;. Grace! What DOES make her so long gettin&rsquo; that hammer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finding the hammer did seem to take a long time. There was no sound from
      the kitchen. Kyan, steadying himself with one hand on the pipe, waved the
      other wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-s-sh! s-sh-h!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Hush! be still! Don&rsquo;t get her in here.
      Keziah, you&rsquo;re single and so am I. You ain&rsquo;t got nobody to take care of
      you and I ain&rsquo;t, neither&mdash;that is, I don&rsquo;t want to be took care of&mdash;I
      mean, I&rsquo;ve been took care of too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin took another step in the direction of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He IS loony!&rdquo; she exclaimed under her breath. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I ain&rsquo;t loony. I want to make a proposal to you. I want to see if
      you won&rsquo;t marry me. I&rsquo;m sick of Laviny. Let&rsquo;s you and me settle down
      together. I could have some peace then. And I think a whole lot of you,
      too,&rdquo; he added, apparently as an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s face was red now, and growing redder every instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kyan Pepper!&rdquo; she cried in amazed incredulity. &ldquo;Kyan Pepper, do you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; pleaded Abishai, in agitated impatience. &ldquo;Say yes quick.
      She&rsquo;ll be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say YES! Why, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to argue, Keziah. I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;most fifteen hundred dollars in
      the bank. Laviny keeps the pass book in her bureau, but you could get it
      from her. I own my house. I&rsquo;m a man of good character. You&rsquo;re poor, but I
      don&rsquo;t let that stand in the way. Anyhow, you&rsquo;re a first-rate housekeeper.
      And I really do think an awful lot of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin stepped no farther in the direction of the kitchen. Instead,
      she strode toward the rickety chair and its occupant. Kyan grasped the
      pipe with both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor&mdash;miserable&mdash;impudent&mdash;&rdquo; began the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Keziah, don&rsquo;t you WANT to?&rdquo; He spoke as if the possibility of a
      refusal had never entered his mind. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;lated you&rsquo;d be glad. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t have to go away then, nor&mdash;My soul and body! some one&rsquo;s
      knockin&rsquo; at the door! AND THIS DUMMED PIPE&rsquo;S FETCHED LOOSE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last sentence was a smothered shriek. Keziah heeded not. Neither did
      she heed the knock at the door. Her hands were opening and closing
      convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be glad!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Glad to marry a good-for-nothin&rsquo; sand-peep like
      you! You sassy&mdash;GET down off that chair and out of this house! Get
      down this minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! This stovepipe&rsquo;s loose, I tell you! Be reason&rsquo;ble, Keziah. Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you touch me! I&rsquo;ll fall if you do. Pl-e-ase, Keziah!&mdash;O Lordy! I knew
      it. LAVINY!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. On the threshold, arms akimbo and lips set tight, stood
      Lavinia Pepper. Her brother&rsquo;s knees gave way; in their collapse they
      struck the chair back; the rickety leg wabbled. Kyan grasped at the pipe
      to save himself and, the next moment, chair, sections of stovepipe, and
      Mr. Pepper disappeared with a mighty crash behind the high-boy. A cloud of
      soot arose and obscured the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah, too indignant even to laugh, glared at the wreck. In the doorway
      of the kitchen Grace Van Horne, hammer in hand, leaned against the jamb,
      her handkerchief at her mouth and tears in her eyes. Lavinia, majestic and
      rigid, dominated the scene. From behind the high-boy came coughs, sneezes,
      and emphatic ejaculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pepper was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abishai Pepper,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;come out of that this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was a tremendous sneeze. Then from the dusky cloud by the wall
      sounded a voice feebly protesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Laviny,&rdquo; began poor Kyan, &ldquo;I never in my life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me? Come out of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of scrambling. More soot floated in the air. Then around
      the corner of the high-boy appeared Mr. Pepper, crawling on his hands and
      knees. His hair was streaked with black; his shirt front and collar and
      shirt sleeves were spotted and smeared with black; and from his blackened
      cheeks his red whiskers flamed like the last glowing embers in a
      fire-scarred ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laviny,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;I never was so surprised and upsot in all my life
      afore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Grace. She collapsed in a chair and laughed
      hysterically. Even the wrathful Keziah smiled. But Lavinia did not smile.
      For that matter, neither did her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; sneered Miss Pepper. &ldquo;Upsot! Yes, I see you&rsquo;re upsot. Get up, and
      try to look as much like a Christian as you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan rose from his knees to his feet and rubbed his back. He glanced
      reproachfully at Grace, then fearfully at his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just tryin&rsquo; to help Keziah take down her stovepipe,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;You see, she didn&rsquo;t have no man to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see. Well, I judge you got it down. Now you go out to the sink and
      wash your face. Heavens and earth! Look at them clothes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope you didn&rsquo;t hurt yourself, Abishai,&rdquo; said the sympathetic
      Keziah. Then, as remembrance of what had led to the upset came to her, she
      added: &ldquo;Though I will say &lsquo;twas your own fault and nobody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia whirled on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His own fault, was it?&rdquo; she repeated, her voice shrill and trembling.
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, marm. I cal&rsquo;late &lsquo;twas his own fault comin&rsquo; here,
      too, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it? Nobody led him on, I s&rsquo;pose. Nobody put him up to riggin&rsquo; 
      out in his best bib and tucker and sneakin&rsquo; here the minute I was out of
      the house. No, nobody did! Of COURSE not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nobody did,&rdquo; said Keziah briskly. &ldquo;And you may know what you&rsquo;re
      hintin&rsquo; at, but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Ain&rsquo;t we innocent! We&rsquo;ve got plenty of money, WE have. Widowers
      with property ain&rsquo;t no attraction to US. Everybody knows that&mdash;oh,
      yes! And they never talk of such a thing&mdash;oh, no! Folks don&rsquo;t say
      that&mdash;that&mdash;Well,&rdquo; with a snarl in the direction of the kitchen,
      &ldquo;are you anywheres nigh clean yet? Get your coat and hat on and come home
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She jerked her brother into the blue coat, jammed the tall hat down upon
      his head, and, seizing him by the arm, stalked to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, marm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I do hope the next widower you get to take
      down your stovepipe&mdash;yes, indeed! ha! ha!&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;ll have
      better luck with him. Though I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;twould be; there ain&rsquo;t no
      more idiots in town that I know of. Good day, and thank you kindly for
      your attentions to our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the door open and was on the step; but Mrs. Coffin did not
      intend to let her go in just that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laviny Pepper,&rdquo; she declared, her eyes snapping, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about, but if you dare to mean that I want any of your
      money, or your brother&rsquo;s money, you&rsquo;re mistaken&mdash;&lsquo;cause I don&rsquo;t. And
      I don&rsquo;t want your brother either&mdash;Lord help him, poor thing! And I
      tell you right now that there&rsquo;s nobody that does; though some kind-hearted
      folks have said &lsquo;twould be a Christian act to poison him, so&rsquo;s to put him
      out of his misery. There! Good mornin&rsquo; to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slammed the door. Lavinia was speechless. As for her brother, but one
      remark of his reached Grace, who was watching from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laviny,&rdquo; pleaded Kyan, &ldquo;just let me explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock that night he was still &ldquo;explaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah turned from the door she had closed behind her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;WELL!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend did not look at her. She was still gazing out of the window.
      Occasionally she seemed to choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah eyed her suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas funny, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dreadfully!&rdquo; was the hurried answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Seems to me you took an awful long time findin&rsquo; that hammer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was away back in the drawer. I didn&rsquo;t see it at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Grace Van Horne, if I thought you heard what that&mdash;that THING
      said to me, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;Good land of mercy! somebody ELSE is
      comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Steps, measured, dignified steps, sounded on the walk. From without came a
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha!&rdquo; a portentous combination of cough and grunt. Grace dodged
      back from the window and hastily began donning her hat and jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I must go. This seems to be your
      busy morning, Aunt Keziah. I&rdquo;&mdash;here she choked again&mdash;&ldquo;really, I
      didn&rsquo;t know you were so popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah opened the door. Captain Elkanah Daniels, prosperous, pompous, and
      unbending, crossed the threshold. Richest man in the village, retired
      shipowner, pillar of the Regular church and leading member of its parish
      committee, Captain Elkanah looked the part. He removed his hat, cleared
      his throat behind his black stock, and spoke with impressive deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Keziah. Ah&mdash;er&mdash;morning, Grace.&rdquo; Even in the tone
      given to a perfunctory salutation like this, the captain differentiated
      between Regular and Come-Outer. &ldquo;Keziah, I&mdash;hum, ha!&mdash;rather
      expected to find you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going, Cap&rsquo;n Daniels,&rdquo; explained the girl. The captain bowed
      and continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Keziah, I came to see you on a somewhat important
      matter. I have a proposal I wish to make you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He must have been surprised at the effect of his words. Keziah&rsquo;s face was
      a picture, a crimson picture of paralyzed amazement. As for Miss Van
      Horne, that young lady gave vent to what her friend described afterwards
      as a &ldquo;squeal,&rdquo; and bolted out of the door and into the grateful seclusion
      of the fog.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH UNEARTHS A PROWLER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The fog was cruel to the gossips of Trumet that day. Mrs. Didama Rogers,
      who lived all alone, except for the society of three cats, a canary, and a
      white poodle named &ldquo;Bunch,&rdquo; in the little house next to Captain Elkanah&rsquo;s
      establishment, never entirely recovered from the chagrin and
      disappointment caused by that provoking mist. When one habitually hurries
      through the morning&rsquo;s household duties in order to sit by the front window
      and note each passer-by, with various fascinating surmises as to his or
      her errand and the reasons for it, it is discouraging to be able to see
      only one&rsquo;s own front fence and a scant ten feet of sidewalk. And then to
      learn afterwards of a dozen most exciting events, each distinctly out of
      the ordinary, which might have been used as excuses for two dozen calls
      and as many sensations! As Captain Zeb Mayo, the irreverent ex-whaler, put
      it, &ldquo;That fog shook Didama&rsquo;s faith in the judgment of Providence. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
      the &lsquo;all wise,&rsquo; but the &lsquo;all seein&rsquo;&rsquo; kind she talks about in meetin&rsquo; now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fog prevented Mrs. Rogers&rsquo;s noting the entrance of Mr. Pepper at the
      Coffin front gate. Also his exit, under sisterly arrest. It shut from her
      view the majestic approach of Captain Elkanah Daniels and Grace&rsquo;s flight,
      her face dimpled with smiles and breaking into laughter at frequent
      intervals. For a young lady, supposed to be a devout Come-Outer, to hurry
      along the main road, a handkerchief at her mouth and her eyes sparkling
      with fun, was a circumstance calculated to furnish material for enjoyable
      scandal. And Didama missed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other happenings she missed, also. Not knowing of Captain Daniels&rsquo;s call
      upon Keziah, she was deprived of the pleasure of wonder at the length of
      his stay. She did not see him, in company with Mrs. Coffin, go down the
      road in the opposite direction from that taken by Grace. Nor their return
      and parting at the gate, two hours later. She did not see&mdash;but there!
      she saw nothing, absolutely nothing&mdash;except the scraggy spruce tree
      in her tiny front yard and the lonely ten feet of walk bordering it. No
      one traversed that section of walk except old Mrs. Tinker, who was
      collecting subscriptions for new hymn books for the Come-Outer chapel. And
      Didama was particularly anxious NOT to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismal day dragged on. The silver-leaf trees dripped, the hedges were
      shining with moisture. Through the stillness the distant surf along the
      &ldquo;ocean side&rdquo; of the Cape growled and moaned and the fog bell at the
      lighthouse clanged miserably. Along the walk opposite Didama&rsquo;s&mdash;the
      more popular side of the road&mdash;shadowy figures passed at long
      intervals, children going to and from school, people on errands to the
      store, and the like. It was three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon before a
      visitor came again to the Coffin front gate, entered the yard and rapped
      at the side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloa!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Back, are you? I begun to think you&rsquo;d been
      scared away for good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace laughed as she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, auntie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you thought I was scared. Truly,
      I didn&rsquo;t think it was proper for me to stay. First Kyan and then Cap&rsquo;n
      Elkanah, and both of them expressing their wishes to see you alone so&mdash;er&mdash;pointedly.
      I thought it was time for me to go. Surely, you give me credit for a
      little delicacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah eyed her grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been a little less delicate about fetchin&rsquo; 
      that hammer, we might have been spared at least one smash-up. I don&rsquo;t
      s&rsquo;pose Laviny&rsquo;ll ever speak to me again. Oh, dear! I guess likely I&rsquo;ll
      never get the memory of that&mdash;that Kyan thing out of my mind. I never
      was so set back in my born days. Yes, you can laugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed herself as she said it. As for Grace, it was sometime before
      that young lady became coherent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He DID look so funny!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Hopping up and down on that shaky
      chair and holding on to that pipe and&mdash;and&mdash;O Aunt Keziah, if
      you could have seen your face when I opened that door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well, I will say you was sometime gettin&rsquo; it open. And then, on top
      of the whole fool business, in parades Elkanah Daniels and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Her companion looked delightedly expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;Then Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah came and the very first
      thing he said was&mdash;I almost laughed in his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost! Humph! that&rsquo;s no exaggeration. The way you put out of that door
      was a caution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what did the cap&rsquo;n mean? Is it a secret? Ahem! shall I
      congratulate you, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Van Horne! there&rsquo;s born fools enough in this town without your
      tryin&rsquo; to be one. You know &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t THAT. Though what &lsquo;twas was surprise
      enough, I will say,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Grace, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; away to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not? Oh, splendid! Has the cap&rsquo;n decided to let you stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess his decidin&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t influence me, if twas stayin&rsquo; in his house
      he meant. The only way I could live here would be on his charity, and that
      would be as poor fodder as sawdust hasty puddin&rsquo;, even if I was fond of
      charity, which I ain&rsquo;t. He said to me&mdash;Well, you take your things off
      and I&rsquo;ll tell you about it. You can stay a little while, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was going to stay all the afternoon and for supper, if you&rsquo;d let
      me. I knew you had so much to do and I wanted to help. I told uncle and he
      said certainly I ought to come. He said he should try to see you and say
      good-by before you left tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! And me a Regular! Well, I&rsquo;m much obliged, though I guess
      your Uncle Eben won&rsquo;t see me to-morrow&mdash;nor speak to me again, when
      he knows what I AM going to do. Grace, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to leave Trumet, not
      for the present, anyhow. I&rsquo;ve got a way of earnin&rsquo; my livin&rsquo; right here.
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to keep house for the new minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned, her hat in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried in utter astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;That was what Elkanah&rsquo;s proposal
      amounted to. Ha! ha! Deary me! When he said &lsquo;proposal,&rsquo; I own up for a
      minute I didn&rsquo;t know WHAT was comin&rsquo;. After Kyan I was prepared for &lsquo;most
      anything. But he told me that Lurany Phelps, who the parish committee had
      counted on to keep house for Mr. Ellery, had sent word her sister was sick
      and couldn&rsquo;t be left, and that somebody must be hired right off &lsquo;cause the
      minister&rsquo;s expected by day after to-morrow&rsquo;s coach. And they&rsquo;d gone over
      every likely candidate in town till it simmered down to Mehitable Burgess.
      And Cap&rsquo;n Zeb Mayo spoke right up in the committee meetin&rsquo; and gave out
      that if Mehitable kept house for Mr. Ellery he, for one, wouldn&rsquo;t come to
      church. Said he didn&rsquo;t want to hear sermons that was inspired by HER
      cookin&rsquo;. Seems she cooked for the Mayos one week when Mrs. Mayo had gone
      to Boston, and Cap&rsquo;n Zeb declares his dreams that week was somethin&rsquo; 
      awful. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m a man with no nerves and mighty little imagination,&rsquo; he
      says. &lsquo;Land knows what effect a dose of Mehitable&rsquo;s biscuits might have on
      a MINISTER.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; continued Keziah, &ldquo;they decided Mehitable wouldn&rsquo;t do, and
      finally somebody thought of me. I have a notion &lsquo;twas Zeb, although Cap&rsquo;n
      Elkanah did his best to make me think &lsquo;twas himself. And the cap&rsquo;n was
      made a delegate to come and see me about it. Come he did, and we settled
      it. I went down to the parsonage with him before dinner and looked the
      place over. There&rsquo;s an awful lot of sweepin&rsquo; and dustin&rsquo; to be done afore
      it&rsquo;s fit for a body to live in. I did think that when I&rsquo;d finished with
      this house I could swear off on that kind of dissipation for a while, but
      I guess, judgin&rsquo; by the looks of that parsonage, what I&rsquo;ve done so far is
      only practice.&rdquo; She paused, glanced keenly at her friend and asked: &ldquo;Why!
      what&rsquo;s the matter? You don&rsquo;t act nigh so glad as I thought you&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace said of course she was glad; but she looked troubled, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly make it seem possible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is it really settled&mdash;your
      salary and everything? And what will you do about your position in
      Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll write Cousin Abner and tell him. Lord love you, HE won&rsquo;t care.
      He&rsquo;ll feel that he did his duty in gettin&rsquo; me the Boston chance and if I
      don&rsquo;t take it &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t his fault. HIS conscience&rsquo;ll be clear. Land sakes!
      if I could clean house as easy as some folks clear their consciences I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have a backache this minute. Yes, the wages are agreed on, too.
      And totin&rsquo; them around won&rsquo;t make my back ache any worse, either,&rdquo; she
      added drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ever and ever so glad for you. I know
      you didn&rsquo;t want to leave Trumet and I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be delighted
      when they learn that you&rsquo;re going to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! that includes Laviny Pepper, of course. I cal&rsquo;late Laviny&rsquo;s
      delight won&rsquo;t keep her up nights. But I guess I can stand it if she can.
      Now, Grace, what is it? You AIN&rsquo;T real pleased? Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m selfish, I guess. I&rsquo;m glad for your sake; you
      mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not. But I almost wish you were going to do something
      else. You are going to live in the Regular parsonage and keep house for,
      of all persons, a Regular minister. Why, so far as my seeing you is
      concerned, you might as well be in China. You know Uncle Eben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah nodded understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know him. Eben Hammond thinks that parsonage is the
      presence chamber of the Evil One, I presume likely. But, Grace, you
      mustn&rsquo;t blame me, and if you don&rsquo;t call I&rsquo;ll know why and I shan&rsquo;t blame
      you. We&rsquo;ll see each other once in a while; I&rsquo;ll take care of that. And,
      deary, I HAD to do it&mdash;I just had to. If you knew what a load had
      been took off my mind by this, you&rsquo;d sympathize with me and understand.
      I&rsquo;ve been happier in Trumet than I ever was anywhere else, though I&rsquo;ve
      seen some dark times here, too. I was born here; my folks used to live
      here. My brother Sol lived and died here. His death was a heavy trouble to
      me, but the heaviest came to me when I was somewheres else and&mdash;well,
      somehow I&rsquo;ve had a feelin&rsquo; that, if there was any real joys ever planned
      out for me while I&rsquo;m on this earth, they&rsquo;d come to me here. I don&rsquo;t know
      when they&rsquo;ll come. There&rsquo;s times when I can&rsquo;t believe they ever will come,
      but&mdash;There! there! everybody has to bear burdens in this life, I
      cal&rsquo;late. It&rsquo;s a vale of tears, &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to you Come-Outer folks, though
      I&rsquo;ve never seen much good in wearin&rsquo; a long face and a crape bathin&rsquo; suit
      on that account. Hey? What are you listenin&rsquo; to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard a carriage stop, that was all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin went to the window and peered into the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t anybody for here, that&rsquo;s sure. I
      guess likely &lsquo;twas Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah. He and Annabel were goin&rsquo; to drive over
      to Denboro this afternoon. She had some trimmin&rsquo; to buy. Takes more than
      fog to separate Annabel Daniels from dressmakin&rsquo;. Well, there&rsquo;s a little
      more packin&rsquo; to do; then I thought I&rsquo;d go down to that parsonage and take
      a whack at the cobwebs. I never saw so many in my born days. You&rsquo;d think
      all the spiders from here to Ostable had been holdin&rsquo; camp meetin&rsquo; in that
      shut-up house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The packing took about an hour. When it was finished, the carpet rolled
      up, and the last piece of linen placed in the old trunk, Keziah turned to
      her guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Gracie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I feel as though I ought to go to the parsonage.
      I can&rsquo;t do much more&rsquo;n look at the cobwebs to-night, but to-morrow those
      spiders had better put on their ascension robes. The end of the world&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo; for them, even though it missed fire for the Millerites when they
      had their doin&rsquo;s a few years ago. You can stay here and wait, if &lsquo;twon&rsquo;t
      be too lonesome. We&rsquo;ll have supper when I get back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace looked tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to go with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to be with you as
      much as I can, and HE isn&rsquo;t there yet. I&rsquo;m afraid uncle might not like it,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho! Come along. Eben Hammond may be a chronic sufferer from acute
      Come-Outiveness, but he ain&rsquo;t a ninny. Nobody&rsquo;ll see you, anyway. This
      fog&rsquo;s like charity, it&rsquo;ll cover a heap of sins. Do come right along. Wait
      till I get on my things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw a shawl over her shoulders, draped a white knitted &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; over
      her head, and took from a nail a key, attached by a strong cord to a block
      of wood eight inches long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elkanah left the key with me,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;No danger of losin&rsquo; it, is
      there. Might as well lose a lumber yard. Old Parson Langley tied it up
      this way, so he wouldn&rsquo;t miss his moorin&rsquo;s, I presume likely. The poor old
      thing was so nearsighted and absent-minded along toward the last that they
      say he used to hire Noah Myrick&rsquo;s boy to come in and look him over every
      Sunday mornin&rsquo; before church, so&rsquo;s to be sure he hadn&rsquo;t got his wig on
      stern foremost. That&rsquo;s the way Zeb Mayo tells the yarn, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the house and came out into the wet mist. Then, turning to the
      right, in the direction which Trumet, with unconscious irony, calls
      &ldquo;downtown,&rdquo; they climbed the long slope where the main road mounts the
      outlying ridge of Cannon Hill, passed Captain Mayo&rsquo;s big house&mdash;the
      finest in Trumet, with the exception of the Daniels mansion&mdash;and
      descended into the hollow beyond. Here, at the corner where the
      &ldquo;Lighthouse Lane&rdquo; begins its winding way over the rolling knolls and dunes
      to the light and the fish shanties on the &ldquo;ocean side,&rdquo; stood the plain,
      straight-up-and-down meeting house of the Regular society. Directly
      opposite was the little parsonage, also very straight up and down. Both
      were painted white with green blinds. This statement is superfluous to
      those who remember Cape architecture at this period; practically every
      building from Sandwich to Provincetown was white and green.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the yard, through the gap in the white fence, and went around
      the house, past the dripping evergreens and the bare, wet lilac bushes, to
      the side door, the lock of which Keziah&rsquo;s key fitted. There was a lock on
      the front door, of course, but no one thought of meddling with that. That
      door had been opened but once during the late pastor&rsquo;s thirty-year
      tenantry. On the occasion of his funeral the mourners came and went, as
      was proper, by that solemn portal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin thrust the key into the keyhole of the side door and essayed
      to turn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she muttered, twisting to no purpose; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why&mdash;This
      must be the right key, because&mdash;Well, I declare, if it ain&rsquo;t unlocked
      already! That&rsquo;s some of Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s. For a critter as fussy and
      particular about some things, he&rsquo;s careless enough about others. Mercy we
      ain&rsquo;t had any tramps around here lately. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way into the dining room of the parsonage. Two of the blinds
      shading the windows of that apartment had been opened when she and Captain
      Daniels made their visit, and the dim gray light made the room more
      lonesome and forsaken in appearance than a deeper gloom could possibly
      have done. The black walnut extension table in the center, closed to its
      smallest dimensions because Parson Langley had eaten alone for so many
      years; the black walnut chairs set back against the wall at regular
      intervals; the rag carpet and braided mats&mdash;homemade donations from
      the ladies of the parish&mdash;on the green painted floor; the dolorous
      pictures on the walls; &ldquo;Death of Washington,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stoning of Stephen,&rdquo; and a
      still more deadly &ldquo;fruit piece&rdquo; committed in oils years ago by a now
      deceased boat painter; a black walnut sideboard with some blue-and-white
      crockery upon it; a gilt-framed mirror with another outrage in oils
      emphasizing its upper half; dust over everything and the cobwebs mentioned
      by Keziah draping the corners of the ceiling; this was the dining room of
      the Regular parsonage as Grace saw it upon this, her first visit. The dust
      and cobwebs were, in her eyes, the only novelties, however. Otherwise, the
      room was like many others in Trumet, and, if there had been one or two
      paintings of ships, would have been typical of the better class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; exclaimed Keziah, sniffing disgustedly. &ldquo;Musty and shut up enough,
      ain&rsquo;t it? Down here in the dampness, and &lsquo;specially in the spring, it
      don&rsquo;t take any time for a house to get musty if it ain&rsquo;t aired out
      regular. Mr. Langley died only three months ago, but we&rsquo;ve been
      candidatin&rsquo; ever since and the candidates have been boarded round. There&rsquo;s
      been enough of &lsquo;em, too; we&rsquo;re awful hard to suit, I guess. That&rsquo;s it. Do
      open some more blinds and a window. Fresh air don&rsquo;t hurt anybody&mdash;unless
      it&rsquo;s spiders,&rdquo; with a glare at the loathed cobwebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blinds and a window being opened, more light entered the room. Grace
      glanced about it curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is going to be your new home now, Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; she observed.
      &ldquo;How queer that seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;h&rsquo;m. Does seem queer, don&rsquo;t it? Must seem queer to you to be so
      near the headquarters of everything your uncle thinks is wicked. Smell of
      brimstone any, does it?&rdquo; she asked with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t noticed it. You&rsquo;ve got a lot of cleaning to do. I wish I
      could help. Look at the mud on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mud?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, so &lsquo;tis! How in the world did that come here?
      Wet feet, sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born. Man&rsquo;s foot, too. Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah&rsquo;s, I guess
      likely; though the prints don&rsquo;t look hardly big enough for his. Elkanah&rsquo;s
      convinced that he&rsquo;s a great man and his boots bear him out in it, don&rsquo;t
      they? Those marks don&rsquo;t look broad enough for his understandin&rsquo;, but I
      guess he made &lsquo;em; nobody else could. Here&rsquo;s the settin&rsquo; room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw open another door. A room gloomy with black walnut and fragrant
      with camphor was dimly visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheerful&rsquo;s a tomb, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; was Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll get
      some light and air in here pretty soon. Here&rsquo;s the front hall and there&rsquo;s
      the front stairs. The parlor&rsquo;s off to the left. We won&rsquo;t bother with that
      yet a while. This little place in here is what Mr. Langley used to call
      his &lsquo;study.&rsquo; Halloa! how this door sticks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door did stick, and no amount of tugging could get it open, though
      Grace added her efforts to those of Keziah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t locked,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Coffin, &ldquo;cause there ain&rsquo;t any lock on
      it. I guess it&rsquo;s just swelled and stuck from the damp. Though it&rsquo;s odd, I
      don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;Oh, well! never mind. Let&rsquo;s sweeten up this settin&rsquo; 
      room a little. Open a window or two in here. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry if we
      want to do anything before it gets dark. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; into the kitchen to get
      a broom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried out, returning in a moment or two with a broom and a most
      disgusted expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s a body goin&rsquo; to sweep with that?&rdquo; she demanded, exhibiting the
      frayed utensil, the business end of which was worn to a stub. &ldquo;More like a
      shovel, enough sight. Well, there&rsquo;s pretty nigh dust enough for a shovel,
      so maybe this&rsquo;ll take off the top layers. S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll ever get this house
      fit for Mr. Ellery to live in before he comes? I wonder if he&rsquo;s a
      particular man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace, who was struggling with a refractory window, paused for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I either. Sol was so bad the Sunday he preached that I couldn&rsquo;t go to
      meetin&rsquo;. They say his sermon was fine; all about those who go down to the
      sea in ships. That&rsquo;s what got the parish committee, I guess; they&rsquo;re all
      old salts. I wonder if he&rsquo;s as fine-lookin&rsquo; as they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Van Horne tossed her head. She was resting, prior to making another
      assault on the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t like
      good-looking ministers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary me! You&rsquo;re different from most females in this town, then. And you
      spoke of his good looks yourself this very mornin&rsquo;. Why don&rsquo;t you like the
      good-lookin&rsquo; ones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because they&rsquo;re always conceited and patronizing and superior&mdash;and
      spoiled. I can just imagine this Mr. Ellery of yours strutting about in
      sewing circle or sociables, with Annabel and Georgianna Lothrop and the
      rest simpering and gushing and getting in his way: &lsquo;O Mr. Ellery, I did so
      enjoy that sermon of yours Sunday!&rsquo; and &lsquo;O Mr. Ellery, it was SO good of
      you to come this afternoon!&rsquo; Pooh! I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a Come-Outer. Not that I
      would simper over him if I wasn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t patronize me&mdash;not more
      than once, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was greatly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully high and mighty, seems to me.
      And changeable since mornin&rsquo;. You was willin&rsquo; enough to talk about him
      then. Now, Gracie, you mustn&rsquo;t take a spite against poor Mr. Ellery just
      because I&rsquo;ve got to keep house for him. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t his fault; he don&rsquo;t even
      know it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I know he&rsquo;ll be a conceited little snippet and I shall hate
      the sight of him. There! there! Auntie, you mustn&rsquo;t mind me. I told you I
      was a selfish pig. But don&rsquo;t you ask me to LIKE this precious minister of
      yours, because I shan&rsquo;t do it. He has no business to come and separate me
      from the best friend I&rsquo;ve got. I&rsquo;d tell him so if he was here&mdash;What
      was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both women looked at each other with startled faces. They listened
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that funny!&rdquo; whispered Keziah. &ldquo;I thought I heard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DID hear. So did I. What do you suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-s-s-h-h! It sounded from the front room somewhere. And yet there can&rsquo;t
      be anybody in there, because&mdash;My soul! there &lsquo;tis again. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
      find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She grasped the stubby broom by the handle and moved determinedly toward
      the front hall. Grace seized her by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, auntie!&rdquo; she whispered frantically. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you DO it! It
      may be a tramp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. Whoever or whatever it is, it has no business in this
      house, and I&rsquo;ll make that plain in a hurry. Just like as not it&rsquo;s a cat
      got in when Elkanah was here this forenoon. Don&rsquo;t be scared, Grace. Come
      right along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl came along, but not with enthusiasm. They tiptoed through the
      dark, narrow hall and peered into the parlor. This apartment was dim and
      still and gloomy, as all proper parlors should be, but there was no sign
      of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; sniffed Keziah. &ldquo;It might have been upstairs, but it didn&rsquo;t sound
      so. What did it sound like to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a footstep at first; and then like something falling&mdash;and
      rustling. Oh, what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin was glancing back down the hall with a strange expression on
      her face. Her grip upon the broom handle tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS it?&rdquo; pleaded the girl in an agonized whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; was the low reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just remembered somethin&rsquo;. That study
      door isn&rsquo;t stuck from the damp, because&mdash;well, because I remember now
      that it was open this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before her companion could fully grasp the import of this paralyzing fact,
      Keziah strode down the hall and seized the knob of the study door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever you are in there,&rdquo; she commanded sternly, &ldquo;open this door and
      come out this minute. Do you hear? I&rsquo;m orderin&rsquo; you to come out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant of silence; then a voice from within made answer, a
      man&rsquo;s voice, and its tone indicated embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I am&mdash;I will be out in another minute. If
      you will just be patient&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace interrupted with a smothered shriek. Keziah brandished the broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patient!&rdquo; she repeated sharply. &ldquo;Well, I like that! What do you mean by&mdash;Open
      that door! Grace, run out and get the&mdash;the constable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This command was delivered entirely for effect. The office of constable in
      Trumet is, generally speaking, a purely honorary one. Its occupant had
      just departed for a week&rsquo;s cruise as mate of a mackerel schooner. However,
      the effect was instantaneous. From behind the door came sounds of hurry
      and commotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get the police on my account, please,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;If you will
      be patient until I get this&mdash;I&rsquo;m just as anxious to come out as you
      can be to have me. Of all the ridiculous&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out then!&rdquo; snapped Keziah. &ldquo;Come out! If you&rsquo;re so everlastin&rsquo; 
      anxious, then come out. Patience! Of all the cheek! Why don&rsquo;t you come out
      NOW?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was brisk and to the point. Evidently, the unknown&rsquo;s stock of
      the virtue which he demanded of others was diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to be frank, since you insist,&rdquo; snapped the voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fully
      dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a staggerer. For once Keziah did not have a reply ready. She
      looked at Grace and the latter at her. Then, without words, they retreated
      to the sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall&mdash;shall I go for help?&rdquo; whispered the girl. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better
      leave him here and&mdash;He doesn&rsquo;t sound like a tramp, does he. What DO
      you suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; continued the voice, broken by panting
      pauses, as if the speaker was struggling into a garment. &ldquo;I know this must
      seem strange. You see, I came on the coach as far as Bayport and then we
      lost a wheel in a rut. There was a&mdash;oh, dear! where IS that&mdash;this
      is supremely idiotic!&mdash;I was saying there happened to be a man coming
      this way with a buggy and he offered to help me along. He was on his way
      to Wellmouth. So I left my trunk to come later and took my valise. It
      rained on the way and I was wet through. I stopped at Captain Daniels&rsquo;s
      house and the girl said he had gone with his daughter to the next town,
      but that they were to stop here at the parsonage on their way. So&mdash;there!
      that&rsquo;s right, at last!&mdash;so I came, hoping to find them. The door was
      open and I came in. The captain and his daughter were not here, but, as I
      was pretty wet, I thought I would seize the opportunity to change my
      clothes. I had some dry&mdash;er&mdash;things in my valise and I&mdash;well,
      then you came, you see, and&mdash;I assure you I&mdash;well, it was the
      most embarrassing&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened. The two in the sitting room huddled close together,
      Keziah holding the broom like a battle-ax, ready for whatsoever might
      develop. From the dimness of the tightly shuttered study stepped the owner
      of the voice, a stranger, a young man, his hair rumpled, his tie
      disarranged, and the buttons of his waistcoat filling the wrong
      buttonholes. Despite this evidence of a hasty toilet in semidarkness, he
      was not unprepossessing. Incidentally, he was blushing furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, ladies,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I scarcely
      know what to say to you. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes becoming accustomed to the light in the sitting room, he was now
      able to see his captors more clearly. He looked at Keziah, then at Miss
      Van Horne, and another wave of blushes passed from his collar up into the
      roots of his hair. Grace blushed, too, though, as she perfectly well knew,
      there was no reason why she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin did not blush. This young fellow, although evidently not a
      tramp or a burglar, had caused her some moments of distinct uneasiness,
      and she resented the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she observed rather tartly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t know what to say,
      but perhaps you might begin by telling us who you are and what you mean by
      makin&rsquo; a&mdash;er&mdash;dressin&rsquo; room of a house that don&rsquo;t belong to you,
      just because you happened to find the door unlocked. After that you might
      explain why you didn&rsquo;t speak up when we first come, instead of keepin&rsquo; so
      mighty quiet. That looks kind of suspicious to me, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger&rsquo;s answer was prompt enough now. It was evident he resented
      the suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because you took me by surprise and I wasn&rsquo;t,
      as I explained&mdash;er&mdash;presentable. Besides, I was afraid of
      frightening you. I assure you I hurried as fast as I could, quietly, and
      when you began to talk&rdquo;&mdash;his expression changed and there was a
      twitch at the corner of his mouth&mdash;&ldquo;I tried to hurry still faster,
      hoping you might not hear me and I could make my appearance&mdash;or my
      escape&mdash;sooner. As for entering the house&mdash;well, I considered
      it, in a way, my house; at least, I knew I should live in it for a time,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live in it?&rdquo; repeated Keziah. &ldquo;LIVE in it? Why! mercy on us! you don&rsquo;t
      mean to say you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped to look at Grace. That young lady was looking at her with an
      expression which, as it expressed so very much, is beyond ordinary powers
      of description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Ellery,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;I am the minister&mdash;the new
      minister of the Regular society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then even Keziah blushed.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH ASSUMES A GUARDIANSHIP
    </h3>
    <p>
      Didama would have given her eyeteeth&mdash;and, for that matter, the
      entire upper set&mdash;to have been present in that parsonage sitting room
      when the Rev. John Ellery made his appearance. But the fates were against
      Didama that day and it was months afterwards before she, or any of what
      Captain Zeb Mayo called the &ldquo;Trumet Daily Advertisers,&rdquo; picked up a hint
      concerning it. Keziah and Grace, acquainted with the possibilities of
      these volunteer news gatherers, were silent, and the Reverend John, being
      in some respects a discreet young man with a brand-new ministerial dignity
      to sustain, refrained from boasting of the sensation he had caused. He
      thought of it very often, usually at most inconvenient times, and when, by
      all the requirements of his high calling, his thought should have been
      busy with different and much less worldly matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thankful Payne, after the new minister&rsquo;s first call
      at her residence, a week after his arrival at Trumet, &ldquo;if Mr. Ellery ain&rsquo;t
      the most sympathetic man. I was readin&rsquo; out loud to him the poem my cousin
      Huldy B.&mdash;her that married Hannibal Ellis over to Denboro&mdash;made
      up when my second husband was lost to sea, and I&rsquo;d just got to the p&rsquo;int
      in the ninth verse where it says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &lsquo;The cruel billows crash and roar,
             And the frail craft is tempest-tossed,
           But the bold mariner thinks not of life, but says,
             &ldquo;It is the fust schooner ever I lost.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And &lsquo;twas, too, and the last, poor thing! Well, I just got fur as this
      when I looked up and there was the minister lookin&rsquo; out of the window and
      his face was just as red, and he kept scowlin&rsquo; and bitin&rsquo; his lips. I do
      believe he was all but sheddin&rsquo; tears. Sympathy like that I appreciate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Mr. Ellery had just seen Grace Van Horne pass that
      window. She had not seen him, but for the moment he was back in that
      disgusting study, making a frenzied toilet in the dusk and obliged to
      overhear remarks pointedly personal to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grace left the parsonage soon after the supposed tramp disclosed his
      identity. Her farewells were hurried and she firmly refused Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s
      not too-insistent appeal to return to the house &ldquo;up street&rdquo; and have
      supper. She said she was glad to meet Mr. Ellery. The young minister
      affirmed his delight in meeting her. Then she disappeared in the misty
      twilight and John Ellery surreptitiously wiped his perspiring forehead
      with his cuff, having in his late desire for the primal necessities
      forgotten such a trifling incidental as a handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; observed Keziah, turning to her guest, or employer, or
      incumbrance&mdash;at present she was more inclined to consider him the
      latter&mdash;&ldquo;well, Mr. Ellery, this has been kind of unexpected for all
      hands, ain&rsquo;t it? If I&rsquo;d known you was comin&rsquo; to-day, I&rsquo;d have done my best
      to have things ready, but Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah said not before day after
      to-morrow and&mdash;but there, what&rsquo;s the use of talkin&rsquo; that way? I
      didn&rsquo;t know I was goin&rsquo; to keep house for you till this very forenoon.
      Mercy me, what a day this has been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister smiled rather one-sidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been something of a day for me,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I am ahead of time
      and I&rsquo;ve made a lot of trouble, I&rsquo;m afraid. But yesterday afternoon I was
      ready and, to tell the truth, I was eager to come and see my new home and
      get at my work. So I started on the morning train. Then the stage broke
      down and I began to think I was stranded at Bayport. But this kind-hearted
      chap from Wellmouth&mdash;I believe that&rsquo;s where he lived&mdash;happened
      to pull up to watch us wrestling with the smashed wheel, and when he found
      I was in a hurry to get to Trumet, offered to give me a lift. His name was&mdash;was
      Bird. No, that wasn&rsquo;t it, but it was something like Bird, or some kind of
      a bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bird?&rdquo; repeated Keziah thoughtfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Birds that I know of in
      Wellmouth. Hum! Hey? &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t Sparrow, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was it&mdash;Sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good land! Emulous Sparrow. Run consider&rsquo;ble to whiskers and tongue,
      didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; he did wear a beard. As for tongue&mdash;well, he was
      conversational, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean. If you rode twelve mile with Emulous, you must have
      had an earache for the last six. Did he ask a question or two about your
      personal affairs, here and there between times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellery laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one or two, between times,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t die of surprise. Did you tell him who you was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, to be honest, I didn&rsquo;t. He was so very anxious to find out, that&mdash;well,
      I dodged. I think he believed I was going to visit Captain Daniels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough! If I was governor of this state I wouldn&rsquo;t send any
      Thanksgivin&rsquo; proclamations down this way. I&rsquo;d just write Em Peters and
      Didama Rogers and a couple more like them and save myself the trouble.
      They&rsquo;d have all I wanted to proclaim spread from one end of the county to
      the other in less&rsquo;n a day, and a peck or two of extrys pitched in for good
      measure. I&rsquo;m awful glad you didn&rsquo;t tell Emulous you was the minister. You
      see, Trumet&rsquo;s Trumet, and, considerin&rsquo; everything, maybe it&rsquo;s just as well
      nobody knows about your bein&rsquo; shut up in that study. Not but what &lsquo;twas
      all right, you know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand. I&rsquo;m not proud of it. Still, some one may have seen me come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, they didn&rsquo;t. This fog is as thick as Injun-meal puddin&rsquo;. Nobody
      saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; with some hesitation, &ldquo;the young lady who was here with you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grace Van Horne! She&rsquo;s all right. She won&rsquo;t tell. She ain&rsquo;t that
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Van Horne? That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a New England name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t. Her folks come from Jersey somewheres. But she was adopted by
      old Cap&rsquo;n Hammond, who keeps the tavern down on the bay shore by the
      packet wharf, and she&rsquo;s lived in Trumet since she was six years old. Her
      father was Teunis Van Horne, and he was mate on Cap&rsquo;n Eben&rsquo;s coastin&rsquo; 
      schooner and was drowned off Hatteras. Eben was saved just by the skin of
      his teeth and got a broken hip and religion while it happened. His hip&rsquo;s
      better except that he&rsquo;s some lame; but his religion&rsquo;s been more and more
      feverish ever since. He&rsquo;s one of the head Come-Outers, and built their
      chapel with his own money. You mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; lightly of
      religion, nor of Cap&rsquo;n Eben, either. He&rsquo;s a dear good soul as ever was,
      but he is the narrowest kind of Come-Outer. His creed is just about as
      wide as the chapel door, and that&rsquo;s as narrow as the way leadin&rsquo; to
      salvation; it IS the way, too, so the Come-Outers think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are Come-Outers? Some new sect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive! Haven&rsquo;t you heard of Come-Outers? Cat&rsquo;s foot! Well, you&rsquo;ll
      hear of &lsquo;em often enough from now on. They&rsquo;re folks who used to go to our
      church, the Regular, but left because the services was too worldly, with
      organs and choir singin&rsquo;, and the road to paradise too easy. No need for
      me to tell you any more. You&rsquo;ll learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellery was interested. He had been in Trumet but once before, on the
      occasion when he preached his trial sermon, and of that memorable visit
      remembered little except the sermon itself, the pews filled with captains
      and their families, and the awe-inspiring personality of Captain Elkanah
      Daniels, who had been his host. To a young man, the ink upon his diploma
      from the theological school still fresh, a trial sermon is a weighty
      matter, and the preaching of it weightier still. He had rehearsed it over
      and over in private, had delivered it almost through clinched teeth, and
      had returned to his room in the Boston boarding house with the conviction
      that it was an utter failure. Captain Elkanah and the gracious Miss
      Annabel, his daughter, had been kind enough to express gratification, and
      their praise alone saved him from despair. Then, to his amazement, the
      call had come. Of casual conversation at the church and about the
      Daniels&rsquo;s table he could recall nothing. So there was another religious
      organization in town and that made up of seceders from his own church. He
      was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;this Miss Van Horne?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is she a&mdash;Come-Outer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one. Couldn&rsquo;t be anything else and live with her
      Uncle Eben, as she calls him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister experienced a curious feeling of disappointment and chagrin.
      This young person, already predisposed to regard a clergyman of his
      denomination with disapproval, had seen him for the first time under most
      humiliating circumstances. And he should never have the opportunity to
      regain her favor, or his own self-respect, by his efforts in the pulpit.
      No matter how well he might preach she would never hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has this Captain Hammond no children of his own?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s answer was short for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;One.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! another daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, a son. Name&rsquo;s Nathaniel, and he&rsquo;s a sea captain. He&rsquo;s on his way from
      Surinam to New York now. They expect him to make port most any time, I
      believe. Now, Mr. Ellery, I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;ve got to arrange for your supper
      and stayin&rsquo; overnight; and with this house the way &lsquo;tis and all, I don&rsquo;t
      see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the minister was still interested in the Hammond household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Nathaniel Hammond?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem enthusiastic over him.
      Is he a black sheep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reply also was short, but emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Keziah. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she resumed her semisoliloquy concerning her companion&rsquo;s
      entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the best thing for you to do will be to go to
      Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;ll be real glad to see you, I know, and you&rsquo;ll be in
      time for supper, for Elkanah and Annabel have been to Denboro and they&rsquo;ll
      be late home. They can keep you overnight, too, for it&rsquo;s a big house with
      lots of rooms. Then, after breakfast to-morrow you come right here. I&rsquo;ll
      have things somewhere near shipshape by then, I guess, though the
      cleanin&rsquo;ll have to be mainly a lick and a promise until I can really get
      at it. Your trunk&rsquo;ll be here on the coach, I s&rsquo;pose, and that&rsquo;ll be
      through early in the forenoon. Get on your hat and coat and I&rsquo;ll go with
      you to Elkanah&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man demurred a little at thrusting himself upon the hospitality
      of the Daniels&rsquo;s home, but Keziah assured him that his unexpected coming
      would cause no trouble. So he entered the now dark study and came out
      wearing his coat and carrying his hat and valise in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m ever so much obliged to you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, as we are going
      to be more or less together&mdash;or at least I guess as much from what
      you say&mdash;would you mind if I suggest a mutual introduction. I&rsquo;m John
      Ellery; you know that already. And you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah stopped short on her way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If I ain&rsquo;t the very worst! Fact is, you
      dropped in so ahead of time and in such a irregular sort of way, that I
      never once thought of introducin&rsquo; anybody; and I&rsquo;m sure Grace didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
      Keziah Coffin, and Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah and I signed articles, so to speak, this
      mornin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to keep house for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She explained the reason upsetting the former arrangement by which Lurania
      Phelps was to have had the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m to keep house for you,&rdquo; she concluded. Adding: &ldquo;For a spell,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you might not like me. You may be particular, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can run that risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well, you can&rsquo;t tell. Or I might not like you. You see, I&rsquo;m pretty
      particular myself,&rdquo; she added with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Daniels&rsquo;s door Keziah turned her new charge over to Matilda Snow,
      the hired girl. It was an indication of the family&rsquo;s social position that
      they kept &ldquo;hired help.&rdquo; This was unusual in Trumet in those days, even
      among the well to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said the young man, extending his hand. &ldquo;Good night, Miss&mdash;or
      is it Mrs.&mdash;Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a widow,&rdquo; explained Matilda. &ldquo;Husband died &lsquo;fore she come back here
      to live. Guess he didn&rsquo;t amount to much; she never mentions his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one thing I meant to tell her,&rdquo; mused the minister, hesitating
      on the threshold. &ldquo;I meant to tell her not to attempt any cleaning up at
      the parsonage to-night. To-morrow will do just as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens to Betsy!&rdquo; sniffed the &ldquo;hired help,&rdquo; speaking from the depths of
      personal conviction, &ldquo;nobody but a born fool would clean house in the
      night, &lsquo;specially after the cleanin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s been doin&rsquo; at her own place. I
      guess you needn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Ellery did not worry. And yet, until three o&rsquo;clock of the following
      morning, the dull light of a whale-oil lantern illuminated the rooms of
      the parsonage as Keziah scrubbed and swept and washed, giving to the musty
      place the &ldquo;lick and promise&rdquo; she had prophesied. If the spiders had
      prepared those ascension robes, they could have used them that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast the wagons belonging to the Wellmouth furniture dealer
      drove in at the gate of the little house opposite Captain Elkanah&rsquo;s, and
      Keziah saw, with a feeling of homesickness which she hid beneath smiles
      and a rattle of conversation, the worn household treasures which had been
      hers, and her brother&rsquo;s before her, carried away out of her life. Then her
      trunks were loaded on the tailboards of the wagons, to be left at the
      parsonage, and with a sigh and a quick brush of her hand across her eyes,
      she locked the door for the last time and walked briskly down the road.
      Soon afterwards John Ellery, under the eminently respectable escort of
      Captain Elkanah and Miss Annabel, emerged from the Daniels&rsquo;s gate and
      followed her. Mrs. Didama Rogers, thankful for a clear atmosphere and an
      unobstructed view, saw them pass and recognized the stranger. And, within
      a quarter of an hour, she, arrayed in a hurried calling costume, was
      spreading the news along the main road. The &ldquo;Trumet Daily Advertiser&rdquo; had,
      so to speak, issued an extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the new minister came to Trumet and thus Keziah Coffin became his
      housekeeper. She entered upon her duties with the whole-hearted energy
      peculiar to her. She was used to hard work, and, as she would have said,
      felt lonesome without it. She cleaned that parsonage from top to bottom.
      Every blind was thrown open and the spring sunshine poured in upon the
      braided mats and the rag carpets. Dust flew in clouds for the first day or
      two, but it flew out of windows and doors and was not allowed to settle
      within. The old black walnut furniture glistened with oil. The mirrors and
      the crockery sparkled from baths of hot water and soap. Even St. Stephen,
      in the engravings on the dining-room wall, was forced to a martyrdom of
      the fullest publicity, because the spots and smears on the glass covering
      his sufferings were violently removed. In the sleeping rooms upstairs the
      feather beds were beaten and aired, the sheets and blankets and patchwork
      comforters exposed to the light, and the window curtains dragged down and
      left to flap on the clothesline. The smell of musty dampness disappeared
      from the dining room and the wholesome odors of outdoors and of good
      things cooking took its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah, in the midst of her labors, found time to coach her employer and
      companion in Trumet ways, and particularly in the ways which Trumet
      expected its clergymen to travel. On the morning following his first night
      in the parsonage, he expressed himself as feeling the need of exercise. He
      thought he should take a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said his housekeeper from her station opposite him at the
      breakfast table, &ldquo;if I was you I wouldn&rsquo;t take too long a one. You&rsquo;d
      better be back here by ten, anyhow. Where was you thinkin&rsquo; of goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellery had no particular destination in mind. He would like to see
      something of the village and, perhaps, if she could give him the names of
      a few of his parishioners, he might make a few calls. Keziah shook her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to do that. You
      ain&rsquo;t been here long enough to make forenoon calls. If you should catch
      some of the women in this town with aprons and calico on, they&rsquo;d never
      forgive you in this world. Wait till afternoon; they&rsquo;ll be expectin&rsquo; you
      then and they&rsquo;ll be rigged out in their best bibs and tuckers. S&rsquo;pose you
      found Annabel Daniels with her hair done up in curl papers; what do you
      think would happen? Mornin&rsquo;s are no time for ministers&rsquo; calls. Even old
      Mr. Langley never made calls in the forenoon&mdash;and he&rsquo;d been here
      thirty-odd years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, you know best. Much obliged for the advice. Then I&rsquo;ll simply
      take my walk and leave the calls until later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be back by ten, though. Folks&rsquo;ll begin callin&rsquo; on you by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will? Doesn&rsquo;t the rule work both ways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with new ministers it don&rsquo;t. Cat&rsquo;s foot! You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose Didama
      Rogers and Laviny Pepper and their kind&rsquo;ll wait any longer&rsquo;n they can help
      afore they come to see what you look like, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they must have seen me when I preached here before. I remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us! that was in meetin&rsquo;. Meetin&rsquo;s diff&rsquo;rent. All they could say
      to you then was how much they liked your sermon. They say that to every
      minister that comes, no matter how they may pick him to pieces afterwards.
      But here they can ask you questions; about how you came to come here and
      what you think of it far&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve got, and what your views are on certain
      points in the creed. Likewise, who your folks were and whether they was
      well off, and a few things like that. Then they&rsquo;ll want to see what kind
      of clothes you wear and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Ellery whistled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re unfolding a pleasant prospect for me, I
      must say. Am I supposed to be catechized on all of my private affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! A minister hasn&rsquo;t got any private affairs; he&rsquo;s a public
      character. There!&rdquo; she laughed, as she poured the coffee, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t
      discourage you. But don&rsquo;t you see that every mother&rsquo;s son&mdash;and, for
      that matter, every daughter and children&rsquo;s child unto the third and fourth
      generation&mdash;feel that, so long as they pay pew rent or put a cent in
      the collection, they own a share in you. And we always keep a watch on our
      investments down this way. That&rsquo;s the Yankee shrewdness you read so much
      about, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister absently played with his spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re a cynic,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I ain&rsquo;t. Though sometimes, considerin&rsquo; everything, I feel as
      though I had excuse enough if I wanted to belong to that tribe. But you&rsquo;re
      young. You mustn&rsquo;t mind my sayin&rsquo; that; if you was old, of course, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t talk about ages. But you are young and this is your first church.
      So you must start right. I&rsquo;m no cynic, bless you. I&rsquo;ve got trust in human
      nature left&mdash;most kinds of human nature. If I hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d have more
      money, I s&rsquo;pose. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve noticed that those who trust a good deal
      are usually poor. It&rsquo;s all right, Mr. Ellery; you go and take your walk.
      And I&rsquo;ll walk into that pantry closet. It&rsquo;ll be a good deal like walkin&rsquo; 
      into the Slough of Despond, but Christian came out on the other side and I
      guess likely I will, if the supply of soapsuds holds out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock, the minister returned from his walk, he
      found Mrs. Rogers waiting in the sitting room. It is a prime qualification
      of an alert reporter to be first on the scene of sensation. Didama was
      seldom beaten. Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s catechism began. Before it was over Keziah
      opened the door to admit Miss Pepper and her brother. &ldquo;Kyan&rdquo; was nervous
      and embarrassed in the housekeeper&rsquo;s presence. Lavinia was a glacier,
      moving majestically and freezing as it moved. Keziah, however, was not
      even touched by the frost; she greeted the pair cordially, and begged them
      to &ldquo;take off their things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dinner time before the catechizers departed. The catechized came to
      the table with an impaired appetite. He looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it worry you, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; observed Keziah calmly. &ldquo;I think I
      can satisfy you. Honest and true, I ain&rsquo;t half as bad as you might think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister looked more troubled than before; also surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Coffin!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Could you hear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I couldn&rsquo;t hear nothin&rsquo; in that closet except my own opinion on
      dirt and dust. But if I was as deaf as the man that set on the powder keg
      and dropped his pipe ashes into it, it wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference.
      The man said after they picked him up that they needn&rsquo;t have been so
      rough, he&rsquo;d have moved without bein&rsquo; pushed if they&rsquo;d have made signs they
      wanted to use the keg. And if I was out in the next lot I&rsquo;d have known
      what you was listenin&rsquo; to in that sittin&rsquo; room. They hinted that they were
      real sorry for you, but &lsquo;twasn&rsquo;t any of THEIR doin&rsquo;s. The parish
      committee, bein&rsquo; just men, was apt to make mistakes in certain matters. Of
      course everything MIGHT be well enough, and if you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t TOO particular
      about cookin&rsquo; and so on, why&mdash;Anyhow, you mustn&rsquo;t think that THEY
      were criticisin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Twas only that they took an interest and&mdash;That was
      about it, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin, I&mdash;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I paid any attention to their
      remarks&mdash;of that kind, I mean. Honestly, I did my best to stop them.
      I said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man alive! I&rsquo;m not worried. Why should you be? We were talkin&rsquo; about
      trust just now&mdash;or I was. Well, you and I&rsquo;ll have to take each other
      on trust for a while, until we see whether we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to suit. If you see
      anything that I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; wrong in, I wish you&rsquo;d tell me. And I&rsquo;ll do the
      same by you, if that&rsquo;s agreeable. You&rsquo;ll hear a lot of things said about
      me, but if they&rsquo;re very bad I give you my word they ain&rsquo;t true. And, to be
      real frank, I&rsquo;ll probably hear some about you, which I&rsquo;ll take for what
      they&rsquo;re worth and considerin&rsquo; who said &lsquo;em. That&rsquo;s a good wholesome
      agreement, I think, for both of us. What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery said, with emphasis, that he thought well of it. He began to
      realize that this woman, with her blunt common sense, was likely to be a
      pilot worth having in the difficult waters which he must navigate as
      skipper of the Regular church in Trumet. Also, he began to realize that,
      as such a skipper, he was most inexperienced. And Captain Daniels had
      spoken highly&mdash;condescendingly but highly&mdash;of his housekeeper&rsquo;s
      qualifications and personality. So the agreement was ratified, with relief
      on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Sunday came and with it the first sermon. He read that sermon to
      Keziah on Saturday evening and she approved of it as a whole, though she
      criticised some of its details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to put in plenty of salt,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where you&rsquo;ve got
      the Christian life and spirit written down as bein&rsquo; like a quiet, peaceful
      home, free from all distrust, and like that, why don&rsquo;t you change it to a
      good safe anchorage, where the soul can ride forever without fear of
      breakers or no&rsquo;theasters or the dangers besettin&rsquo; the mariner on a lee
      shore. They&rsquo;ll understand that; it gets right home to &lsquo;em. There&rsquo;s
      scarcely a man or a woman in your congregation that ain&rsquo;t been out of
      sight of land for weeks on a stretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast hour on Sunday would be at nine o&rsquo;clock, instead of seven,
      as on week days, she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trumet lays to bed Sunday mornin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost a part
      of its religion, as you might say, and lived up to more conscientious than
      some other parts, I&rsquo;m afraid. Six days shalt thou labor and wear
      comfort&rsquo;ble clothes; and on the seventh you must be lazy and dress up.
      Likewise you must have baked beans Saturday for supper, as we&rsquo;re havin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;em, and more beans with fish balls next mornin&rsquo;. That is, if you want to
      be orthodox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The service began at eleven o&rsquo;clock. At half past ten the sexton, old Mr.
      Jubal Knowles, rang the &ldquo;first bell,&rdquo; a clanging five-minute reminder.
      Twenty minutes later he began on the second and final call. Mr. Ellery was
      ready&mdash;and nervous&mdash;before the first bell had finished ringing.
      But Keziah, entering the sitting room dressed in black alpaca and carrying
      the hymn book with her name in gilt letters on the cover, forbade his
      leaving the parsonage thus early.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go pretty soon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you mustn&rsquo;t. The minister ain&rsquo;t
      expected until the last bell&rsquo;s &lsquo;most done. Parson Langley used to wait
      until the Winslows went in. Gaius Winslow is a widower man who lives up to
      the west end of the town and he&rsquo;s got nine children, all boys. You&rsquo;ll know
      &lsquo;em because they always drive down to meetin&rsquo; in one carryall with a white
      horse. Gaius is as punctual as a boardin&rsquo;-house dinner. The old parson
      used to wait until the last Winslow had toddled up the meetin&rsquo;-house steps
      and then he&rsquo;d come out of this side door with his sermon in his hand. It&rsquo;s
      a pretty good rule to remember and saves watchin&rsquo; the clock. Besides, it&rsquo;s
      what we&rsquo;ve been used to, and that goes a good ways with some folks.
      Good-by, Mr. Ellery. You&rsquo;ll see me in the third pew from the back, on the
      right side, wishin&rsquo; you luck just as hard as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, as in couples or family groups, afoot or in all sorts of vehicles, the
      members of Trumet&rsquo;s Regular society came to the church to hear their new
      minister, that functionary peeped under the parlor window shade of the
      parsonage and waited, fidgetting and apprehensive, for the Winslows. They
      arrived at last, and were not hard to recognize, for ten individuals
      packed into one carriage are hard to overlook anywhere. As Gaius, with the
      youngest in his arms, passed in at the church door, John Ellery passed out
      of the parsonage gate. The last bell clanged its final stroke, the
      vibrations ceased, the rustle of skirts and the sounds of decorous
      coughing subsided and were succeeded by the dry rattle of the hymn-book
      pages, the organ, presented by Captain Elkanah and played by his daughter,
      uttered its preliminary groan, the service began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the spring breeze stirred the budding silver-leafs, the distant
      breakers grumbled, the crows in the pines near Captain Eben Hammond&rsquo;s
      tavern cawed ribald answers to the screaming gulls perched along the top
      of the breakwater. And seated on one of the hard benches of the little
      Come-Outer chapel, Grace Van Horne heard her &ldquo;Uncle Eben,&rdquo; who, as usual,
      was conducting the meeting, speak of &ldquo;them who, in purple and fine linen,
      with organs and trumpets and vain shows, are gathered elsewhere in this
      community to hear a hired priest make a mock of the gospel.&rdquo; (A-MEN!)
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Ellery, the &ldquo;hired priest,&rdquo; knew nothing of this. He did know,
      however, that he was the center of interest for his own congregation, the
      people among whom he had been called to labor. Their praise or criticism
      meant everything to him; therefore he preached for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keziah Coffin, in the third pew from the back, watched him intently,
      her mind working in sympathetic unison with his. She was not one to be
      greatly influenced by first impressions, but she had been favorably
      impressed by this young fellow, and had already begun to feel that sense
      of guardianship and personal responsibility which, later on, was to make
      Captain Zebedee Mayo nickname the minister &ldquo;Keziah&rsquo;s Parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sermon was a success.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH&rsquo;S PARSON DECIDES TO RUN IT BLINDFOLD
    </h3>
    <p>
      On Monday afternoon the minister made a few calls. Keziah made out a short
      list for him to follow, a &ldquo;sort of chart of the main channel,&rdquo; she called
      it, &ldquo;with the safe ports marked and the shoals and risky places labeled
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Trumet ain&rsquo;t a course you can navigate with your
      eyes shut. We divide ourselves into about four sets&mdash;aristocrats,
      poor relations, town folks, and scum. The aristocrats are the big bugs
      like Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah and the other well-off sea captains, afloat or ashore.
      They &lsquo;most all go to the Regular church and the parish committee is
      steered by &lsquo;em. The poor relations are mainly widows and such, whose
      husbands died or were lost at sea. Most of them are Regulars. The town
      folks are those that stay ashore and keep store or run salt works or
      somethin&rsquo;. And the scum work around on odd jobs or go fishin&rsquo;. So, if you
      really want to be safe, you must call on the aristocrats first, after that
      on the poor relations, and so on down. You won&rsquo;t be bothered with scum
      much; they&rsquo;re mainly Come-Outers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery took the list from her hand and looked it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he said musingly. &ldquo;Am I supposed to recognize these&mdash;er&mdash;class
      distinctions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That is, not in meetin&rsquo; or sewin&rsquo; circle or anything like that, or
      not out and out and open anywhere. But you want to cultivate a sort of
      different handshake and how-dy-do for each set, so&rsquo;s to speak. Gush all
      you want to over an aristocrat. Be thankful for advice and always SO glad
      to see &lsquo;em. With the poor relations you can ease up on the gush and maybe
      condescend some. Town folks expect condescension and superiority; give it
      to &lsquo;em. When it comes to scum, why&mdash;well, any short kind of a bow and
      a &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo; &lsquo;ll do for them. &lsquo;Course the Lord, in His infinite mercy, made
      &lsquo;em, same as He did potato bugs, but it&rsquo;s necessary to keep both bugs and
      them down to their proper place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She delivered this in the intervals between trips to the kitchen with the
      dinner dishes. The minister listened with a troubled expression on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m dull. There was a Scotch professor at
      college and the fellows used to say his bump of humor was a dent. Maybe
      mine isn&rsquo;t much better. Are you joking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah stacked the cups and saucers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a poor relation in this village
      for a good while and my brother was a shoemaker and on the upper fringe of
      the town-folk class. My humor bump would have to stick up like Cannon Hill
      afore I could see any joke in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not seriously advising me to treat a rich man differently from
      a poor one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not openly different&mdash;no. But if you want to steer a perfectly SAFE
      course, one that&rsquo;ll keep deep water under your keel the whole voyage, why,
      there&rsquo;s your chart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellery promptly tore the &ldquo;chart&rdquo; into small pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shall be back by supper time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin eyed him grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to run it blindfold, are you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grimness disappeared and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have your supper ready for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bring back a good
      appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man hesitated on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;would YOU have called only on the aristocrats
      at first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, smiling still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;not me. I&rsquo;ve always taken risks. But I didn&rsquo;t know but
      you might be a safe sailor. It saves a lot of trouble in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, perhaps even the scum may count for somethin&rsquo; over there.&rdquo; She
      turned to face him and her smile vanished. &ldquo;Go on, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Go and call where you please. Far be it from me that I should tell you to
      do anything else. I suppose likely you hope some day to be a great
      preacher. I hope you will. But I&rsquo;d enough sight rather you was a good man
      than the very greatest. No reason why you can&rsquo;t be both. There was a
      preacher over in Galilee once, so you told us yesterday, who was just
      good. &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t till years afterwards that the crowd came to realize that
      he was great, too. And, if I recollect right, he chummed in with publicans
      and sinners. I&rsquo;m glad you tore up that fool paper of mine. I hoped you
      might when I gave it to you. Now you run along, and I&rsquo;ll wash dishes. If
      cleanliness is next to godliness, then a parson ought to eat out of clean
      plates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the minister&rsquo;s calls were in the nature of a
      compromise, although an unintentional one. He dropped in on Zebedee Mayo,
      owner of the big house on the slope of the hill. Captain Zeb took him up
      into what he called his &ldquo;cupoler,&rdquo; the observatory on the top of the
      house, and showed him Trumet spread out like a map. The main road was
      north and south, winding and twisting its rutted, sandy way. Along it were
      clustered the principal houses and shops, shaded by silver-leaf poplars, a
      few elms, and some willows and spruces. Each tree bent slightly away from
      the northeast, the direction from which blew the heavy winter gales.
      Beyond the main road were green slopes and pastures, with swamps in the
      hollows, swamps which were to be cranberry bogs in the days to come. Then
      the lower road, with more houses, and, farther on, the beach, the flats&mdash;partially
      uncovered because it was high tide&mdash;and the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the Mayo house was the crest of Cannon Hill, more hills, pastures
      and swamps, scattered houses and pine groves. Then began the tumbled,
      humped waste of sand dunes, and, over their ragged fringes of beach plum
      and bayberry bushes, the deep blue of the wide Atlantic. The lighthouse
      was a white dot and the fish shanties a blotch of brown. Along the inner
      edge of the blue were scars of dancing white, the flashing teeth of hungry
      shoals which had torn to pieces and swallowed many a good ship. And, far
      out, dotted and sprinkled along the horizon, were sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Captain Zeb, puffing still from the exertion of climbing the
      ladder to the &ldquo;cupoler,&rdquo; for he was distinctly &ldquo;fleshy.&rdquo; &ldquo;See? The
      beacon&rsquo;s up. Packet come in this mornin&rsquo;. There she is. See her down there
      by the breakwater?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the empty barrel, painted red, was hoisted to the top of its
      pole on the crest of Cannon Hill. And, looking down at the bay and
      following the direction of the stubby pointing finger, Ellery saw a little
      schooner, with her sails lowered, lying, slightly on her side, in a
      shallow pool near a long ridge of piled stones&mdash;the breakwater. A
      small wharf made out from the shore and black figures moved briskly upon
      it. Carts were alongside the schooner and there more dots were busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben&rsquo;s pennant&rsquo;s flyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Captain Zeb. &ldquo;He always sets colors when
      the packet&rsquo;s in. Keeps packet tavern, Eben does. That&rsquo;s it, that
      old-fashioned, gambrel-roofed house on the rise by the wharf. Call it
      &lsquo;Saints&rsquo; Rest,&rsquo; they do now, &lsquo;cause Eben&rsquo;s so mighty religious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister saw the long, rambling house, with one lonely, twisted tree
      in its yard, a flag flying from a pole beside it. So that was where the
      Hammonds lived. And where the girl lived who was certain he was a
      &ldquo;conceited snippet.&rdquo; Whatever he might be in reality he hoped it was not
      that. &ldquo;Snippet&rdquo; was not in his dictionary, but he didn&rsquo;t like the sound of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who owns the packet?&rdquo; he asked, to make conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zach Foster. Married Freewill Doane&rsquo;s daughter over to Harniss. She&rsquo;s
      dead now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good sailor, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb spat in supreme disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good farmer!&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;Zach took over the packet for a debt when the
      chap that used to run her died. His dad, old man Foster, raised garden
      truck at the same time mine went to sea. Both of us took after our
      fathers, I guess. Anyhow, my wife says that when I die &lsquo;twill be of salt
      water on the brain, and I&rsquo;m sure Zach&rsquo;s head is part cabbage. Been better
      for him if he&rsquo;d stuck to his garden. However, I s&rsquo;pose he does his best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say angels can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-m. Well, Zach&rsquo;ll be an angel pretty soon if he keeps on cruisin&rsquo; with
      that old hooker as she is. &lsquo;Bijah Perry, he&rsquo;s mate and the only good
      seaman aboard, tells me that most of the riggin&rsquo;s rotten and the main
      topmast ain&rsquo;t sound, by a good deal. The old man&rsquo;s put off havin&rsquo; her
      overhauled for two reasons, one that repairs cost money, and t&rsquo;other that
      puttin&rsquo; off is the main sheet of his gospel. When there&rsquo;s no rain the roof
      don&rsquo;t leak and long&rsquo;s it don&rsquo;t blow too hard &lsquo;most any kind of gear&rsquo;ll
      hold. That&rsquo;s philosophy&mdash;cabbage philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery decided that he should like Captain Zeb, although it was evident
      that the old whaler had decided opinions of his own which he did not
      hesitate to express. He judged that the Mayos were of the so-called
      aristocracy, but undoubtedly unique specimens. He visited four more
      households that afternoon. The last call was at Mrs. Thankful Payne&rsquo;s, and
      while there, listening to the wonderful &ldquo;poem,&rdquo; he saw Miss Van Horne pass
      the window, as has already been told. He came home to a Cape Cod supper of
      scalloped clams, hot biscuits, and baked Indian pudding, and Keziah
      greeted him with a cheery smile which made him feel that it WAS home. His
      summary disposal of the &ldquo;chart&rdquo; had evidently raised him in his
      housekeeper&rsquo;s estimation. She did not ask a single question as to where he
      had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he had a taste of Trumet&rsquo;s real aristocracy, the genuine article.
      Captain Elkanah Daniels and his daughter made their first formal call. The
      captain was majestic in high hat, fur-collared cape, tailed coat, and
      carrying a gold-headed cane. Miss Annabel wore her newest gown and bonnet
      and rustled as she walked. They entered the sitting room and the lady
      glanced superciliously about the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha!&rdquo; barked Captain Elkanah. &ldquo;Ahem! Mr. Ellery, I trust you&rsquo;re
      being made comfortable. The parish committee are&mdash;hum&mdash;ah&mdash;anxious
      that you should be. Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister said that he was very comfortable indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;ve been used to, we know,&rdquo; observed Miss Annabel. &ldquo;Mr.
      Langley, our former pastor, was a sweet old gentleman, but he was
      old-fashioned and his tastes were queer, especially in art. Have you
      noticed that &lsquo;fruit piece&rsquo; in the dining room? Isn&rsquo;t it too ridiculous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery admitted that the fruit piece was rather funny; but no doubt it had
      been a gift and so
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;Yes, indeed. I guess it was a present, fast enough. Nobody would
      buy such a thing. It seems strange to pa and me that, although so many of
      our people have been abroad, they have such strange ideas of art. Do you
      remember the beautiful marbles in the palaces at Florence, Mr. Ellery? Of
      course you&rsquo;ve seen them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister was obliged to admit that he had never been abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so? I&rsquo;ve been so many times with pa that it seems almost as
      if everybody was as familiar with Yurrup as I am. You remember what I said
      about the marbles, pa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her parent nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha! Oh, yes, yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was when I was in the
      fruit-carrying trade and made a voyage to Valenchy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Valencia, pa,&rdquo; corrected Annabel. &ldquo;And Valencia is in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. But we went to Leghorn afterwards. I sailed to Cronstadt for
      some years regular. Cronstadt is in Rooshy, Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Russia, pa,&rdquo; snapped his daughter. Then she changed the subject to church
      and parish affairs. They spoke of the sewing circle and the reading
      society and the Friday-evening meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Come-Outers are so vexed with us,&rdquo; tittered Miss Annabel, &ldquo;that they
      won&rsquo;t even hold prayer meeting on the same night as ours. They have theirs
      on Thursday nights and it&rsquo;s as good as a play to hear them shout and sing
      and carry on. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the Come-Outers, Mr. Ellery. They&rsquo;re a perfect
      delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as they rose to go Captain Elkanah asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything you&rsquo;d like done about the parsonage, Mr. Ellery? If so,
      it shall be done immejitly. How are you satisfied with your housekeeper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, indeed, Captain Daniels,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a character, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; giggled Annabel. &ldquo;She was born here in
      Trumet, but went away to New Bedford when she was young and grew up there.
      Her maiden name was Hall, but while she was away she married a man named
      Ansel Coffin. They didn&rsquo;t live together very long and weren&rsquo;t happy, I
      guess. I don&rsquo;t know whose fault it was, nobody knows much of anything
      about it, for that&rsquo;s the one thing she won&rsquo;t talk about. Anyhow, the
      Coffin man was lost to sea, and after a while she came back to keep house
      for her brother Solomon. She&rsquo;s an awful odd stick, but she&rsquo;s a good cook,
      I believe; though I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t get the meals people such as
      ourselves, who&rsquo;ve been so much in the city, are used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery thought of the meals at his city boarding house and shuddered. He
      was an orphan and had boarded for years. Incidentally, he had worked his
      way through college. Captain Elkanah cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha! Keziah, come in here a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah came in response to the call, her sewing in her hand. The
      renovation of the parsonage had so far progressed that she could now find
      time for a little sewing, after the dinner dishes were done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; said the captain pompously, &ldquo;we expect you to look out for Mr.
      Ellery in every respect. The parish committee expects that&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coffin shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, that&rsquo;s all. You can go. We must be going, too, Mr. Ellery.
      Please consider our house at your disposal any time. Be neighborly&mdash;hum&mdash;ha!&mdash;be
      neighborly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; purred Annabel. &ldquo;DO come and see us often. Congenial society is
      very scarce in Trumet, for me especially. We can read together. Are you
      fond of Moore, Mr. Ellery? I just dote on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last &ldquo;hum&mdash;ha&rdquo; was partially drowned by the click of the gate.
      Keziah closed the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; said the minister, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t trouble the parish committee.
      Be sure of that. I&rsquo;m perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah sat down in the rocker and her needle moved very briskly for a
      moment. Then she said, without looking up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. I own up I like to hear you say it. And I am glad there are
      some things I do like about this new place of mine. Because&mdash;well,
      because there&rsquo;s likely to be others that I shan&rsquo;t like at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Friday evening the minister conducted his first prayer meeting. Before
      it, and afterwards, he heard a good deal concerning the Come-Outers. He
      learned that Captain Eben Hammond had preached against him in the chapel
      on Sunday. Most of his own parishioners seemed to think it a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stir &lsquo;em up, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; counseled Lavinia Pepper. &ldquo;Stir &lsquo;em up! Don&rsquo;t
      be afraid to answer em from the pulpit and set &lsquo;em where they belong.
      Ignorant, bigoted things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others gave similar counsel. The result was that the young man became
      still more interested in these people who seemed to hate him and all he
      stood for so profoundly. He wished he might hear their side of the case
      and judge it for himself. It may as well be acknowledged now that John
      Ellery had a habit of wishing to judge for himself. This is not always a
      politic habit in a country minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun of the following Thursday morning rose behind a curtain of fog as
      dense as that of the day upon which Ellery arrived. A flat calm in the
      forenoon, the wind changed about three o&rsquo;clock and, beginning with a sharp
      and sudden squall from the northwest, blew hard and steady. Yet the fog
      still cloaked everything and refused to be blown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s rain astern,&rdquo; observed Captain Zeb, with the air of authority
      which belongs to seafaring men when speaking of the weather. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a
      hard, driving rain afore mornin&rsquo;, you see. Then, if she still holds from
      the northwest&rsquo;ard, it&rsquo;ll fair off fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; out in this, Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; exclaimed Keziah, in amazement, as the
      minister put on his hat and coat about seven that evening. &ldquo;Sakes alive!
      you won&rsquo;t be able to see the way to the gate. It&rsquo;s as dark as a nigger&rsquo;s
      pocket and thicker than young ones in a poor man&rsquo;s family, as my father
      used to say. You&rsquo;ll be wet through. Where in the world are you bound for
      THIS night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister equivocated. He said he had been in the house all day and
      felt like a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take an umbrella, then,&rdquo; was the housekeeper&rsquo;s advice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need
      it before you get back, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dark enough and thick enough, in all conscience. The main road was
      a black, wet void, through which gleams from lighted windows were but
      vague, yellow blotches. The umbrella was useful in the same way that a
      blind man&rsquo;s cane is useful, in feeling the way. The two or three
      stragglers who met the minister carried lanterns. One of these stragglers
      was Mr. Pepper. Kyan was astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I snum!&rdquo; cried Kyan, raising the lantern. &ldquo;If &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t Mr. Ellery.
      Where you bound this kind of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the minister could answer, a stately figure appeared and joined the
      pair. Lavinia, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you lost, out in this fog? Anybody
      sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, no one was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mercy. Goin&rsquo; callin&rsquo;, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Queer weather for a walk, I call it. Won&rsquo;t be many out to-night,
      except Come-Outers goin&rsquo; to holler their lungs loose at prayer meetin&rsquo;.
      He, he! You ain&rsquo;t turned Come-Outer, have you, Mr. Ellery? You&rsquo;ve headed
      right for the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery&rsquo;s reply was hurried and a bit confused. He said good night and went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laviny,&rdquo; whispered the shocked Kyan, &ldquo;do you think that was a&mdash;er&mdash;polite
      thing to say to a parson? That about his turnin&rsquo; Come-Outer? He didn&rsquo;t
      make much answer, seemed to me. You don&rsquo;t think he was mad, do ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he was,&rdquo; snorted Miss Pepper. &ldquo;He could tell a body where
      he was goin&rsquo; then. Nobody can snub me, minister or not. I think he&rsquo;s kind
      of stuck-up, if you want to know, and if he is, he&rsquo;ll get took down in a
      hurry. Come along, don&rsquo;t stand there with your mouth open like a flytrap.
      I&rsquo;d like to know what he was up to. I&rsquo;ve a precious good mind to follow
      him; would if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so much trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t. Yet, if she had, she would have deemed the trouble worth
      while. For John Ellery stumbled on through the mist till he reached the
      &ldquo;Corners&rdquo; where the store was located and the roads forked. There, he
      turned to the right, into the way called locally &ldquo;Hammond&rsquo;s Turn-off.&rdquo; A
      short distance down the &ldquo;Turn-off&rdquo; stood a small, brown-shingled building,
      its windows alight. Opposite its door, on the other side of the road, grew
      a spreading hornbeam tree surrounded by a cluster of swamp blackberry
      bushes. In the black shadow of the hornbeam Mr. Ellery stood still. He was
      debating in his mind a question: should he or should he not enter that
      building?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there, groups of people emerged from the fog and darkness and
      passed in at the door. Some of them he had seen during his fortnight in
      Trumet. Others were strangers to him. A lantern danced and wabbled up the
      &ldquo;Turn-off&rdquo; from the direction of the bay shore and the packet wharf. It
      drew near, and he saw that it was carried by an old man with long white
      hair and chin beard, who walked with a slight limp. Beside him was a thin
      woman wearing a black poke bonnet and a shawl. In the rear of the pair
      came another woman, a young woman, judging by the way she was dressed and
      her lithe, vigorous step. The trio halted on the platform of the building.
      The old man blew out the lantern. Then he threw the door open and a stream
      of yellow light poured over the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman was Grace Van Horne. The minister recognized her at once.
      Undoubtedly, the old man with the limp was her guardian, Captain Eben
      Hammond, who, by common report, had spoken of him, Ellery, as a &ldquo;hired
      priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed. A few moments thereafter the sound of a squeaky melodeon
      came from within the building. It wailed and quavered and groaned. Then,
      with a suddenness that was startling, came the first verse of a hymn, sung
      with tremendous enthusiasm:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oh, who shall answer when the Lord shall call
             His ransomed sinners home?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The hallelujah chorus was still ringing when the watcher across the street
      stepped out from the shadow of the hornbeam. Without a pause he strode
      over to the platform. Another moment and the door had shut behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister of the Trumet Regular church had entered the Come-Outer
      chapel to attend a Come-Outer prayer meeting!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE PARSON CRUISES IN STRANGE WATERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Come-Outer chapel was as bare inside, almost, as it was without. Bare
      wooden walls, a beamed ceiling, a raised platform at one end with a table
      and chairs and the melodeon upon it, rows of wooden settees for the
      congregation&mdash;that was all. As the minister entered, the worshipers
      were standing up to sing. Three or four sputtering oil lamps but dimly
      illumined the place and made recognition uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second verse of the hymn was just beginning as Ellery came in. Most of
      the forty or more grown people in the chapel were too busy wrestling with
      the tune to turn and look at him. A child here and there in the back row
      twisted a curious neck but twisted back again as parental fingers tugged
      at its ear. The minister tiptoed to a dark corner and took his stand in
      front of a vacant settee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whom Ellery had decided must be Captain Eben Hammond was standing
      on the low platform beside the table. A quaint figure, patriarchal with
      its flowing white hair and beard, puritanical with its set, smooth-shaven
      lips and tufted brows. Captain Eben held an open hymn book back in one
      hand and beat time with the other. He wore brass-bowed spectacles well
      down toward the tip of his nose. Swinging a heavy, stubby finger and
      singing in a high, quavering voice of no particular register, he led off
      the third verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Oh, who shall weep when the roll is called
             And who shall shout for joy?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The melodeon and the hymn book were in accord as to the tune, but Captain
      Eben and the various members of the congregation seemed to have a desire
      to improvise. They sang with spirit, however, and the rhythmic pat of feet
      grew louder and louder. Here and there men and women were swaying and
      rocking their bodies in time to the music. The chorus for each verse was
      louder than the one preceding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hymn was given out and sung. And another and still another. The
      windows rattled. The patting grew to a steady &ldquo;thump! thump!&rdquo; Momentary
      pauses between lines were punctuated by hallelujahs and amens. Standing
      directly in front of the minister was a six-foot, raw-boned individual
      whose clothes smelled strongly of fish, and whose hands, each swung at the
      end of an exposed five inches of hairy red wrist, looked like flippers. At
      the end of the third hymn this personage sprang straight up into the air,
      cracked the heels of a pair of red cowhide boots together, and whooped:
      &ldquo;Glory be! Send the PAOWER!&rdquo; in a voice like the screech of a northeast
      gale. Mr. Ellery, whom this gymnastic feat had taken by surprise, jumped
      in sympathy, although not as high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The singing over, the worshipers sat down. Captain Eben took a figured
      handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead. The thin, nearsighted
      young woman who had been humped over the keyboard of the melodeon,
      straightened up. The worshipers relaxed a little and began to look about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the captain adjusted his spectacles and opened a Bible, which he took
      from the table beside him. Clearing his throat, he announced that he would
      read from the Word, tenth chapter of Jeremiah:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Thus saith the Lord. Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not
      dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of
      the forest, the work of the hands of the workmen, with the ax.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read in a measured singsong, stopping occasionally to hold the book in
      a better light and peering at the fine print through his spectacles. And
      as he read, there was a sudden rustle on one of the back benches. A child
      had turned, stared, and pulled at its mother&rsquo;s sleeve. The rustle grew and
      spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eben drawled on to the twentieth verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken: my children are
      gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my
      tent any more, and to set up my curtains!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the Lord:
      therefore they shall not prosper, and&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-MEN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shout came from the second bench from the front, where Ezekiel
      Bassett, clam digger and fervent religionist, was always to be found on
      meeting nights. Ezekiel was the father of Susannah B. Bassett, &ldquo;Sukey B.&rdquo;
       for short, who played the melodeon. He had been, by successive seizures, a
      Seventh Day Baptist, a Second Adventist, a Millerite, a Regular, and was
      now the most energetic of Come-Outers. Later he was to become a
      Spiritualist and preside at table-tipping seances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel&rsquo;s amen was so sudden and emphatic that it startled the reader into
      looking up. Instead of the faces of his congregation, he found himself
      treated to a view of their back hair. Nearly every head was turned toward
      the rear corner of the room, there was a buzz of whispering and, in front,
      many men and women were standing up to look. Captain Eben was scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is this a prayer meetin&rsquo; or&mdash;or&mdash;what?
      Brethren and sisters, I must say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel Bassett stepped forward and whispered in his ear. The captain&rsquo;s
      expression of righteous indignation changed to one of blank astonishment.
      He, too, gazed at the dark corner. Then his lips tightened and he rapped
      smartly on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren and sisters,&rdquo; he thundered, in the voice which, of old, had
      enforced obedience aboard his coasting schooner, &ldquo;remember this is the
      house of the Lord. Be reverent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited until every eye had swung about to meet his. Then he regarded
      his abashed but excited hearers with a steady and prolonged stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us bow in prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery could have repeated that prayer, almost word for word, years
      after that night. The captain prayed for the few here gathered together:
      Let them be steadfast. Let them be constant in the way. The path they were
      treading might be narrow and beset with thorns, but it was the path
      leading to glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoffers may sneer,&rdquo; he declared, his voice rising; &ldquo;they may make a mock
      of us, they may even come into Thy presence to laugh at us, but theirs is
      the laugh that turns to groanin&rsquo;. O Lord, strengthen us to-night to speak
      what&rsquo;s in our hearts, without fear.&rdquo; (&ldquo;A-men!&rdquo;) &ldquo;To prophesy in Thy name!
      To bid the mockers and them that dare&mdash;dare to profane this sanctuary
      be careful. Hired singers and trumpets and vain shows we have not&rdquo; (&ldquo;Thank
      the Lord! Amen!&rdquo;), &ldquo;but the true faith and the joy of it we do have.&rdquo;
       (&ldquo;Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      And so on, his remarks becoming more personal and ever pointing like a
      compass needle to the occupant of that seat in the corner. The minister&rsquo;s
      determination to attend a Come-Outer meeting, though it had reached the
      sticking point only a half hour before, was the result of considerable
      deliberation. He had argued with himself and had made up his mind to find
      out for himself just what these people did. He was finding out, certainly.
      His motives were good and he had come with no desire to scoff, but, for
      the life of him, he could not help feeling like a criminal. Incidentally,
      it provoked him to feel that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; prayed Captain Hammond, the perspiration in beads on his
      forehead, &ldquo;Thou hast said that the pastors become brutish and have not
      sought Thee and that they shan&rsquo;t prosper. Help us tonight to labor with
      this one that he may see his error and repent in sackcloth and ashes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sang once more, a hymn that prophesied woe to the unbeliever. Then
      Ezekiel Bassett rose to &ldquo;testify.&rdquo; The testimony was mainly to the effect
      that he was happy because he had fled to the ark of safety while there was
      yet time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found out,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;that fancy music and&mdash;ah&mdash;and&mdash;ah&mdash;sot
      sermons and fine duds and suchlike wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do ME no good. I needed
      somethin&rsquo; else. I needed good times in my religion&rdquo; (&ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;) &ldquo;and
      I&rsquo;ve found &lsquo;em right here. Yes, sir! right here. And I say this out loud,&rdquo;
       turning to glare at the intruder, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care who comes to poke fun
      at me for sayin&rsquo; it.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp-nosed female followed Mr. Bassett. She spoke with evident feeling
      and in a voice that trembled and shook when her emotion carried it aloft.
      SHE&rsquo;D had enough of high-toned religion. Yes, and of them that upheld it.
      When her brother Simeon was took bad with phthisic, &ldquo;wheezin&rsquo; like a
      busted bellerses&rdquo; and &lsquo;twas &ldquo;up and down, trot, trot, trot,&rdquo; to fetch and
      carry for him day in and night out, did the folks from the Reg&rsquo;lar church
      help her? She guessed NOT. The only one that came nigh her was Laviny
      Pepper, and she came only to gas and gabble and find out things that
      wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t none of her business. What help she got was from a Come-Outer, from
      Eben Hammond, bless his good soul! (&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;) That phthisic settled her for
      Reg&rsquo;larism. Yes, and for them that preached it, too. So there!
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Eben called for more testimony. But the testifiers were, to use
      the old minstrel joke, backward in coming forward that evening. At an
      ordinary meeting, by this time, the shouts and enthusiasm would have been
      at their height and half a dozen Come-Outers on their feet at once,
      relating their experiences and proclaiming their happiness. But tonight
      there was a damper; the presence of the leader of the opposition cast a
      shadow over the gathering. Only the bravest attempted speech. The others
      sat silent, showing their resentment and contempt by frowning glances over
      their shoulders and portentous nods one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, brethren,&rdquo; commanded the captain sharply; &ldquo;we are waitin&rsquo; to hear
      you. Are you afraid? If your faith is real, nothin&rsquo; nor nobody should keep
      you from cryin&rsquo; it out loud. Now, if ever, is the accepted time. Speak up
      for the spirit that&rsquo;s in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An elderly man, grave and quiet, arose and said a few words, dignified and
      solemn words of prayer and thankfulness for the comfort this little
      society of true believers had been to him. Ellery realized that here was
      another sort of Come-Outer, one of the Hammond type. Evidently, they were
      not all like Ezekiel and the shrill-voiced woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, from the settee in front of him, rose the lengthy and fishy person
      with the cowhide boots and enormous hands. His name was Josiah Badger and
      he was, according to Trumet&rsquo;s estimate, &ldquo;a little mite lackin&rsquo; in his top
      riggin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He stuttered, and this infirmity became more and more apparent
      as he grew eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t afraid,&rdquo; he proclaimed. &ldquo;They can call me a
      C-C-Come-Outer all they want to. I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care if they do. Let &lsquo;em,
      I say; l-let &lsquo;em! They can p-p-poke their fun and p-p-p-pup-pup-poke it,
      but I tell &lsquo;em to h-heave ahead and p-pup-pup-POKE. When I used to g-go to
      their old Reg&rsquo;lar meetin&rsquo; house, all I done was to go to sleep. But I
      don&rsquo;t go to sleep here, glory hallelujah! No, sir! There&rsquo;s too much
      b-b-blessed noise and we have too g-good times to g-go to sleep here. That
      old K-Kyan Pepper called me t-town f-fool t&rsquo;other day. T-tut-town fool&rsquo;s
      what he called me. Says I to him, says I: &lsquo;You-you-y-you ain&rsquo;t got spunk
      enough to be a fool,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;unless Laviny says you c-can be. You old
      Reg&rsquo;lar p-p-pepper shaker, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time tee-hees from the children and chuckles from some of the
      older members interfered with Mr. Badger&rsquo;s fervent but jerky discourse.
      Captain Eben struck the table smartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;Silence! Brother Badger, I beg your pardon for
      &lsquo;em. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Josiah&rsquo;s train of thought had evidently been derailed by the
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;s about all,&rdquo; he stammered and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked over the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ashamed of the behavior of some of us in the
      Lord&rsquo;s house. This has been a failure, this service of ours. We have kept
      still when we should have justified our faith, and allowed the presence of
      a stranger to interfere with our duty to the Almighty. And I will say,&rdquo; he
      added, his voice rising and trembling with indignation, &ldquo;to him who came
      here uninvited and broke up this meetin&rsquo;, that it would be well for him to
      remember the words of Scriptur&rsquo;, &lsquo;Woe unto ye, false prophets and workers
      of iniquity.&rsquo; Let him remember what the Divine wisdom put into my head to
      read to-night: &lsquo;The pastors have become brutish and have not sought the
      Lord; therefore they shall not prosper.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; The cries came from all parts of the
      little room. They ceased abruptly, for John Ellery was on his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hammond,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I realize that I have no right to speak in
      this building, but I must say one word. My coming here to-night may have
      been a mistake; I&rsquo;m inclined to think it was. But I came not, as you seem
      to infer, to sneer or to scoff; certainly I had no wish to disturb your
      service. I came because I had heard repeatedly, since my arrival in this
      town, of this society and its meetings. I had heard, too, that there
      seemed to be a feeling of antagonism, almost hatred, against me among you
      here. I couldn&rsquo;t see why. Most of you have, I believe, been at one time
      members of the church where I preach. I wished to find out for myself how
      much of truth there was in the stories I had heard and to see if a better
      feeling between the two societies might not be brought about. Those were
      my reasons for coming here to-night. As for my being a false prophet and a
      worker of iniquity&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;well, there is another verse of
      Scripture I would call to your attention: &lsquo;Judge not, that ye be not
      judged.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down. There was silence for a moment and then a buzz of whispering.
      Captain Eben, who had heard him with a face of iron hardness, rapped the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will sing in closin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the forty-second hymn. After which
      the benediction will be pronounced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Regular minister left the Come-Outers&rsquo; meeting with the unpleasant
      conviction that he had blundered badly. His visit, instead of tending
      toward better understanding and more cordial relationship, had been
      regarded as an intrusion. He had been provoked into a public
      justification, and now he was quite sure that he would have been more
      politic to remain silent. He realized that the evening&rsquo;s performance would
      cause a sensation and be talked about all over town. The Come-Outers would
      glory in their leader&rsquo;s denunciation of him, and his own people would
      perhaps feel that it served him right. If he had only told Mrs. Coffin of
      what he intended to do. Yet he had not told her because he meant to do it
      anyhow. Altogether it was a rather humiliating business.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that old bigot was the Van Horne girl&rsquo;s &ldquo;uncle.&rdquo; It hardly seemed
      possible that she, who appeared so refined and ladylike when he met her at
      the parsonage, should be a member of that curious company. When he rose to
      speak he had seen her in the front row, beside the thin, middle-aged
      female who had entered the chapel with Captain Hammond and with her. She
      was looking at him intently. The lamp over the speaker&rsquo;s table had shone
      full on her face and the picture remained in his memory. He saw her eyes
      and the wavy shadows of her hair on her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped off the platform, across the road, out of the way of
      homeward-bound Come-Outers, and stood there, thinking. The fog was as
      heavy and wet as ever; in fact, it was almost a rain. The wind was blowing
      hard from the northwest. The congregation dispersed in chattering groups,
      their lanterns dipping and swinging like fireflies. The chatter dealt
      entirely with one subject&mdash;himself. He heard his name mentioned at
      least twenty times. Out of the gusty, dripping blackness came Mr. Badger&rsquo;s
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By time!&rdquo; crowed Josiah, &ldquo;he was took down a few p-p-pup-pegs, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he!
      My! how Eben did g-gi-gi-give it to him. He looked toler&rsquo;ble white under
      the gills when he riz up to heave out his s-s-sus-sassy talk. And foolish,
      too. I cal&rsquo;late I won&rsquo;t be the only town fuf-fuf-fool from now on. He!
      he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noises died away in the distance. Within the chapel the tramp of heavy
      boots sounded as the lights were blown out, one by one. The minister
      frowned, sighed, and turned homeward. It is not pleasant to be called a
      fool, even by a recognized member of the fraternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken but a few steps when there was a rustle in the wet grass
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; whispered a voice, &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, may I speak to you just a
      moment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! why, Miss Van Horne!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she began, speaking hurriedly and in a low voice, &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      felt that I must say a word to you before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and glanced back at the chapel. Ezekiel Bassett, the janitor,
      having extinguished the last lamp, had emerged from the door and was
      locking up. In another moment he clumped past them in the middle of the
      road, the circle of light from his lantern just missing them as they stood
      in the grass at the side under the hornbeam and blackberry bushes. He was
      alone; Sukey B. had gone on before, other and younger masculine escort
      having been providentially provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bassett was out of hearing before Grace finished her sentence. The
      minister was silent, waiting and wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I must see you and&mdash;explain. I am SO sorry
      you came here to-night. Oh, I wish you hadn&rsquo;t. What made you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; began Ellery, somewhat stiffly, &ldquo;because I&mdash;well, because I
      thought it might be a good thing to do. As I said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. But it wasn&rsquo;t. It was so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So foolish. Thank you, I&rsquo;m aware of it. I&rsquo;ve heard myself called a fool
      already since I left your church. Not that I needed to hear it. I realize
      the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a bitterness in his tone, unmistakable. And a little laugh from
      his companion did not tend to soothe his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps it is funny. I did not find it so. Good
      evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was priggish, but it must be borne in mind that John Ellery was very,
      very fresh from the theological school, where young divines are taught to
      take themselves seriously. He was ashamed of himself as soon as he said
      it, which proved that his case was not beyond hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl detained him as he was turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t laughing at that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know who called you that&mdash;that
      name. It was Josiah Badger, and he really is one, you know. I was thinking
      of his testimony in meeting and how he called Ky&mdash;Abishai&mdash;a
      pepper shaker. That was ridiculous enough, but it reminded me of something
      else about Mr. Pepper, and I HAD to laugh. It wasn&rsquo;t at you, truly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the minister begged her pardon; also he remained where he was, and
      heard the drops from the tree patter hollow on his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came after you,&rdquo; went on Grace rapidly and with nervous haste, &ldquo;because
      I felt that you ought not to misjudge my uncle for what he said to-night.
      He wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt your feelings for the world. He is a good man and
      does good to everybody. If you only knew the good he does do, you wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;you
      wouldn&rsquo;t DARE think hardly of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stamped her foot in the wet grass as she said it. She was evidently in
      earnest. But Ellery was not in the mood to be greatly impressed by Eben
      Hammond&rsquo;s charity or innate goodness. The old tavern keeper&rsquo;s references
      to himself were too fresh in his mind. &ldquo;False prophet&rdquo; and &ldquo;worker of
      iniquity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not judging your uncle,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It seemed to me that the boot
      was on the other leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but you do judge him, and you mustn&rsquo;t. You see, he thought you
      had come to make fun of him&mdash;and us. Some of the Regular people do,
      people who aren&rsquo;t fit to tie his shoes. And so he spoke against you. He&rsquo;ll
      be sorry when he thinks it over. That&rsquo;s what I came to tell you. I ask
      your pardon for&mdash;for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s all right. I think I understood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking it because he&rsquo;s a Come-Outer and you&rsquo;re a Regular
      minister. He isn&rsquo;t ashamed of his religion. Neither am I. I&rsquo;m a
      Come-Outer, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;I supposed you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am. There, good night, Mr. Ellery. All I ask is that you don&rsquo;t
      think too hardly of uncle. He didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away now, and it was the minister who detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; he said slowly, for in his present state of mind it
      was a hard thing to say, &ldquo;that perhaps I ought to apologize, too. I&rsquo;m
      afraid I did disturb your service and I&rsquo;m sorry. I meant well, but&mdash;What&rsquo;s
      that? Rain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no doubt about it; it was rain and plenty of it. It came in a
      swooping downpour that beat upon the trees and bushes and roared upon the
      roof of the chapel. The minister hurriedly raised his umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;let me&mdash;Miss Van Horne! Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer came from a short distance down the &ldquo;Turn-off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; called the girl. &ldquo;I must run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently, she WAS running. Therefore the young man ran after her. He
      caught up with her in a moment, in spite of some stumbles over the rough
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;you must take the umbrella. Really, you must. You
      haven&rsquo;t one and you&rsquo;ll be wet through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pushed the umbrella aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it; I&rsquo;m used to wet weather; truly I
      am. And I don&rsquo;t care for this hat; it&rsquo;s an old one. You have a long way to
      go and I haven&rsquo;t. Please, Mr. Ellery, I can&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was the sternly self-sacrificing reply, &ldquo;then I shall
      certainly go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t wish you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;m not going to let you go unprotected through this
      flood. Especially as you might have been at home before this if you hadn&rsquo;t
      stopped to speak with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was the irresistible force and the immovable object. They stood stock
      still in the middle of the road, while the rain drops jumped as they
      struck the umbrella top. The immovable object, being feminine, voiced the
      unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;then I suppose I shall have to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The umbrella. I&rsquo;m sorry, and you&rsquo;ll get dreadfully wet, but it&rsquo;s your own
      fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could feel her hand near his own on the handle. He did not relinquish
      his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think, on the whole, that that is unreasonable. I SHOULD
      get wet and, though I don&rsquo;t mind it when it is necessary, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; rather sharply, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with you as far as your gate. I&rsquo;m sorry, if my company is distasteful,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence, thinking, it may be, that she might finish
      it for him. But she was silent, merely removing her hand from the handle.
      She took a step forward; he followed, holding the umbrella above her head.
      They plashed on, without speaking, through the rapidly forming puddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she stumbled and he caught her arm to prevent her falling. To
      his surprise he felt that arm shake in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Van Horne!&rdquo; he exclaimed in great concern, &ldquo;are you crying? I
      beg your pardon. Of course I wouldn&rsquo;t think of going another step with
      you. I didn&rsquo;t mean to trouble you. I only&mdash;If you will please take
      this umbrella&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he tried to transfer the umbrella and again she pushed it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; she gasped; &ldquo;but&mdash;oh, dear! this is SO
      funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellery gazed blankly at her through the rain-streaked dark. This was
      the most astonishing young person he had met in his twenty-three years of
      worldly experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well, perhaps it is. Our ideas of fun seem to
      differ. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it IS so funny. You don&rsquo;t understand. What do you think your
      congregation would say if they knew you had been to a Come-Outers&rsquo; meeting
      and then insisted on seeing a Come-Outer girl home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery swallowed hard. A vision of Captain Elkanah Daniels and the
      stately Miss Annabel rose before his mind&rsquo;s eye. He hadn&rsquo;t thought of his
      congregation in connection with this impromptu rescue of a damsel in
      distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he laughed mournfully. &ldquo;I guess it is rather funny, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is. Now will you leave me and go back to your parsonage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless you take the umbrella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. It is a beautiful evening for a walk, don&rsquo;t you think so? Mr.
      Ellery, I&rsquo;m afraid we shan&rsquo;t have you with us in Trumet very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, because you&rsquo;re so very, very original. Are your sermons that way,
      too? Captain Elkanah doesn&rsquo;t like his ministers to be too original.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister set his teeth. At that moment he felt an intense desire to
      bid the Daniels family mind their own business. Then another thought
      struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly your Uncle Eben might be somewhat&mdash;er&mdash;surprised if he
      knew you were with me. Perhaps he might have something to say on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he would. We shall know very soon. I ran away and left him with
      Mrs. Poundberry, our housekeeper. He doesn&rsquo;t know where I am. I wonder he
      hasn&rsquo;t turned back to look for me before this. We shall probably meet him
      at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to enjoy the prospect of the meeting. Ellery wondered what on
      earth he should say to Captain Hammond&mdash;that is, provided he was
      allowed to say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a heavier gust of rain and wind beat upon them. The minister
      struggled with the umbrella. The gust passed and with it the fog. An
      instant before it had been all about them, shutting them within inky
      walls. Now it was not. Through the rain he could see the shadowy
      silhouettes of bushes at the road side. Fifty yards away the lighted
      windows of the Hammond tavern gleamed yellow. Farther on, over a ragged,
      moving fringe of grass and weeds, was a black flat expanse&mdash;the bay.
      And a little way out upon that expanse twinkled the lights of a vessel. A
      chain rattled. Voices shouting exultingly came to their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace in excited wonder, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the packet! She was due
      this morning, but we didn&rsquo;t expect her in till to-morrow. How did she find
      her way in the fog? I must tell uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started to run toward the house. The minister would have followed with
      the umbrella, but she stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she urged earnestly. &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m all right
      now. Thank you. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few steps farther on she turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah won&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she whispered, the laugh returning to
      her voice. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery stood still in the rain and watched her. He saw her pass the
      lighted windows and open a door. Into the yellow radiance she flashed and
      disappeared. A minute more and the bulky form of Eben Hammond, lantern in
      hand, a sou&rsquo;wester on his head and his shoulders working themselves into
      an oilskin coat, burst out of the door and hurriedly limped down toward
      the shore. On the threshold, framed in light, stood his ward, gazing after
      him. And the minister gazed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bay came the sound of oars in row-locks. A boat was approaching
      the wharf. And suddenly from the boat came a hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo! Ahoy, dad! Is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an answering shout from the wharf; a shout of joy. Then a rattle
      of oars and a clamor of talk. And Grace still stood in the doorway,
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lantern bobbed up the slope. As it reached the tavern gateway, the
      minister saw that it was now carried by a tall, active man, who walked
      with a seaman&rsquo;s stride and roll. Captain Eben was close beside him,
      talking excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace! Grace!&rdquo; screamed Captain Eben. &ldquo;Gracie, girl, look who&rsquo;s come!
      Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall man ran forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, Grace!&rdquo; he cried in a deep, hearty voice. &ldquo;Is that you? Ain&rsquo;t you got
      a word for your old messmate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stepped out into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! why, NAT!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big man picked her up bodily in his arms and carried her into the
      house. Captain Eben followed and the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery picked his way homeward through the puddles and the pouring
      rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Keziah in the sitting room, seated by the table, evidently
      writing a letter. She looked tired and grave&mdash;for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed as he entered. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re soppin&rsquo; now, sartin
      sure. There&rsquo;s a light in your room. Take off your wet things and throw &lsquo;em
      down to me, and I&rsquo;ll dry &lsquo;em in the kitchen. Better leave your boots here
      now and stand that umbrella in the sink. The kettle&rsquo;s on the stove; you&rsquo;d
      better have somethin&rsquo; hot&mdash;ginger tea or somethin&rsquo;. I told you not to
      go out such a night as this. Where in the world have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister said he would tell her all about it in the morning. Just now
      he thought he had better go up and take off his wet clothes. He declined
      the ginger tea, and, after removing his boots, went upstairs to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah dipped her pen in the ink and went on with her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inclose ten dollars,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;It is all I can send you now. More
      than I ought to afford. Goodness knows why I send anything. You don&rsquo;t
      deserve it. But while I live and you do I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister called from the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my coat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cuffs and lower part of the sleeves are
      pretty wet. By the way, the packet came in to-night. They didn&rsquo;t expect
      her so soon on account of the fog. There was a passenger aboard whom I
      think must be that Nathaniel Hammond you told me of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s pen stopped. The wet coat struck the hall floor with a soft
      thump. The tick of the clock sounded loud in the room. A sheet of
      wind-driven rain lashed the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; called the minister. &ldquo;I said that Nathaniel Hammond,
      Captain Eben&rsquo;s son, came on the packet. I didn&rsquo;t meet him, but I&rsquo;m sure it
      was he. Er&mdash;Mrs. Coffin, are you there? Do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper laid the pen down beside the unfinished letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hear you. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For minutes she sat there, leaning back in her chair and staring at the
      wall. Then she rose, went into the hall, picked up the coat, and took it
      out into the kitchen, where she hung it on the clotheshorse by the cook
      stove. After a while she returned to the table and took up the pen. Her
      face in the lamplight looked more tired and grave than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before John Ellery fell asleep. He had much to think of&mdash;of
      the morrow, of the talk his rash visit to the chapel would cause, of the
      explanation he must make to Captain Elkanah and the rest. But the picture
      that was before his closed eyes as he lay there was neither of Captain
      Elkanah nor the parish committee; it was that of a girl, with dark hair
      and a slim, graceful figure, standing in a lighted doorway and peering out
      into the rain.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH OLD FRIENDS MEET
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Ellery came down to breakfast the rain was over, the wind had gone
      down, and the morning sunshine was pouring in at the dining-room windows.
      Outside the lilacs were in bud, the bluebirds were singing, and there was
      a sniff of real spring in the air. The storm was at an end and yet the
      young minister was conscious of a troublesome feeling that, for him, it
      was just beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he had determined while dressing to make a clean breast of it to
      his housekeeper&mdash;a nominally clean breast, that is. There were some
      things he would not tell her, some that he would not speak of to anyone,
      the picture in the doorway for instance. True, it was only a picture and
      of no moment, but it was pleasant to remember. One of the very few
      pleasant things connected with the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as they sat opposite each other at the table, he began his confession.
      The muffins scorched in the oven and the coffeepot boiled over as he told
      his story, for Keziah was too much interested to think of trifles.
      Interested and astounded, for, since Come-Outers had been Come-Outers and
      the split in the society took place, no Regular minister had crossed the
      threshold of a seceder&rsquo;s dwelling, much less attended their services and
      walked home with a member of their congregation. She knew what this
      amazing procedure was likely to mean, if her parson did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she exclaimed when the recital was finished. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I was too hasty,&rdquo; observed Mr. Ellery thoughtfully.
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would have been wiser not to have done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps &lsquo;twould. Yes, I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder a mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be talked about some, I suppose. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid some of my own people may think it queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer! Say, Mr. Ellery, you remind me of a half-breed Portugee feller&mdash;half
      Portugee and a half Indian&mdash;that went to sea with my father, back in
      the old days. He hardly ever spoke a word, mainly grunted and made signs.
      One day he and another fo&rsquo;mast hand went aloft in a calm to do somethin&rsquo; 
      to the tops&rsquo;l. The half-breed&mdash;they called him Billy Peter and he
      always called himself that&mdash;was out on the end of the yard, with his
      foot on the rope underneath, I forget the name of it, when the tarred
      twine he had for a shoe string caught. Tryin&rsquo; to get it loose it broke
      sudden, his shoe pulled off, he lost his balance and fell. He grabbed at
      the yard, saved himself for a second, fell again, grabbed the next yard,
      then a rope and so on down, grabbin&rsquo; and pullin&rsquo; all the way. First his
      shoe hit the deck, then his sheath knife, then a piece of rope, and
      finally himself, landin&rsquo; right on top of the Irish cook who was goin&rsquo; aft
      from the galley with father&rsquo;s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was the greatest racket you ever heard, pans fallin&rsquo;, dishes
      smashin&rsquo;, men yellin&rsquo;, and the cook swearin&rsquo;. Father run on deck, thinkin&rsquo; 
      the ship was dismasted. He found the cook and Billy Peter sittin&rsquo; in the
      middle of the mess, lookin&rsquo; at each other. Neither was hurt a mite. The
      mates and the crew, part of &lsquo;em, was standin&rsquo; starin&rsquo; at the pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For Heaven sakes!&rsquo; says father; &lsquo;what happened?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The half-breed looked up and rubbed his head. &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Billy
      Peter bust his shoe string.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cook, his name was O&rsquo;Neill, looked at him disgusted. &lsquo;Well, begorra!&rsquo; 
      says he, &lsquo;Billy Peter, you don&rsquo;t exaggerate none, do ye! It&rsquo;s a good thing
      BOTH of &lsquo;em didn&rsquo;t bust or we&rsquo;d have foundered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remind me of Billy Peter, Mr. Ellery, you don&rsquo;t exaggerate. Queer?
      Some folks think your goin&rsquo; to that meetin&rsquo; last night QUEER? At this
      moment one half of Trumet is talkin&rsquo; about it and runnin&rsquo; out to tell the
      other half. I guess I&rsquo;d better hurry up with this breakfast. We&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; 
      to have callers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, however, this prophecy of early morning visitors did not
      prove true. Nine o&rsquo;clock, then ten, and no visitor came to the parsonage.
      Mrs. Coffin affirmed that she did not understand it. Where was Didama?
      Where Lavinia Pepper? Had the &ldquo;Trumet Daily Advertiser&rdquo; suspended
      publication?
    </p>
    <p>
      At half past ten the gate slammed. Keziah peered from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Here comes Elkanah and he&rsquo;s got storm signals
      set, by the looks. He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; after you, Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; was the calm reply; &ldquo;let him come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you goin&rsquo; to say to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except that I did what I considered right at the time. Show him
      into the study, Mrs. Coffin, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Daniels marched to the dining-room door, his gold-headed cane
      marking time like a drumbeat. He nodded curtly to Keziah, who answered the
      knock, and stepped across the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha!&rdquo; he barked. &ldquo;Is the minister&mdash;hum&mdash;ha! is Mr.
      Ellery in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper announced the visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as sour as a skimmin&rsquo; of last week&rsquo;s milk,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid of him, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not. Show him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Say, Mr. Ellery, it&rsquo;s none of my business, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say
      anything about your seein&rsquo; Grace home. That&rsquo;s none of HIS business,
      either, or anybody else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head of the parish committee stalked into the study and the door
      closed behind him. A rumble of voices in animated conversation succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin went out into the kitchen and resumed her business of making a
      dried-apple pie. There was a hot fire in the stove and she opened the back
      door to let in the fresh air. She worked briskly, rolling out the dough,
      filling the deep dish, and pinking the edges of the upper crust with a
      fork. She was thinking as she worked, but not of the minister or his
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put the pie in the oven and set the damper. And, as she knelt by the
      stove, something struck her lightly on the back of the neck. She looked up
      and about her, but there was no one in sight. Then she picked up the
      object which had struck her. It was a cranberry, withered and softened by
      the winter frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the cranberry, then at the open door, and her eyes twinkled.
      Running quickly to the threshold she peered out. The back yard was,
      apparently, empty, save for a few hens belonging to near neighbors, and
      these had stopped scratching for a living and were huddled near the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;You rascal! Eddie Snow, if it&rsquo;s you, I&rsquo;ll be after you
      in a minute. Just because you&rsquo;re big enough to quit school and drive store
      wagon is no reason why I can&rsquo;t&mdash;Hey? Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking down below the door, which opened outward and was swung
      partly back on its hinges. From under the door projected a boot, a man&rsquo;s
      boot and one of ample size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s cheeks, already red from the heat of the stove, reddened still
      more. Her lips twitched and her eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;They say you can tell the Old Scratch by his
      footprints, even if you can&rsquo;t smell the sulphur. Anyhow, you can tell a
      Hammond by the size of his boots. Come out from behind that door this
      minute. Ain&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the boot stepped forth from behind the door and seized her by
      both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, Keziah!&rdquo; he cried joyfully. &ldquo;My, but it&rsquo;s good to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo, Nat!&rdquo; said Keziah heartily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of good to see you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest of him was in keeping with his boots. He was big and
      broad-shouldered and bearded. His face, above the beard, was tanned to a
      deep reddish brown, and the corners of his eyes were marked with dozens of
      tiny wrinkles. He was dressed in blue cloth and wore a wide-brimmed, soft
      felt hat. He entered the kitchen and tossed the hat into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you act surprised to see a feller? Here
      I&rsquo;ve been cruisin&rsquo; from the Horn to Barnegat and back again, and you act
      as if I&rsquo;d just dropped in to fetch the cup of molasses I borrowed
      yesterday. What do you mean by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I heard you&rsquo;d made port.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, hey? That&rsquo;s Trumet, sure pop. You ain&rsquo;t the only one. I sneaked off
      acrost lots so&rsquo;s to dodge the gang of neighbors that I knew would be
      sailin&rsquo; into our yard, the whole fleet loaded to the gunwale with
      questions. Wanted to see you first, Keziah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. So, instead of callin&rsquo; like a Christian, you crept up the back way
      and threw cranberries at me. Ain&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a mite.&rdquo; He took a handful of the frostbitten berries from his coat
      pocket and inspected them lovingly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they fine?&rdquo; he asked, crunching
      two or three between his teeth. &ldquo;I picked &lsquo;em up as I came along. I tell
      you, that&rsquo;s the home taste, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat those frozen things. They&rsquo;ll give you your never-get-over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Cape Cod cranberries! Never in the world. I&rsquo;d rather eat sand down
      here than the finest mug my steward can cook. Tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,
      though; I&rsquo;ll swear off on the cranberries if you&rsquo;ll give me a four-inch
      slice of that pie I saw you put in the oven. Dried-apple, I&rsquo;ll bet my
      sou&rsquo;wester. Think you might ask a feller to sit down. Ain&rsquo;t you glad to
      see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin pulled forward one of the kitchen chairs. He seated himself on
      it and it groaned under his weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled. &ldquo;Never made to stand rough weather, was it? Well,
      AIN&rsquo;T you glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah looked at him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m glad, Nat,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? I hoped you would be, but I did want to hear you say it. Now you come
      to anchor yourself and let&rsquo;s have a talk. I&rsquo;ve been countin&rsquo; on it ever
      since we set tops&rsquo;ls off Surinam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper took the other chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you&mdash;&rdquo; she began. He stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-shh!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything for a minute. Let me look at
      you. Just as clean and wholesome and good-lookin&rsquo; as ever. They don&rsquo;t make
      girls like that anywhere else but down on this old sand bar. Not a day
      older, by the jumpin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Nat,&rdquo; she protested; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk foolish. Girl? Not a day older?
      Why, if feelin&rsquo;s count for anything, I&rsquo;m as old as Methusaleh. Haven&rsquo;t I
      had enough to make me old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was grave immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Keziah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dough head, that&rsquo;s a fact. I
      hadn&rsquo;t forgot about Sol, but I was so glad to be home again and to see dad
      and Grace and the old town and you that everything else flew out of my
      mind. Poor Sol! I liked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He liked you, too. No wonder, considerin&rsquo; what you did to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay! Never mind that. Poor chap! Well, he&rsquo;s rid of his sufferin&rsquo;s at
      last. Tell me about it, if you can without bringin&rsquo; all the trouble back
      too plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she told him of her brother&rsquo;s sickness and death, of having to give up
      the old home, and, finally, of her acceptance of the housekeeper&rsquo;s
      position. He listened, at first with sympathy and then with suppressed
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the jumpin&rsquo; Moses!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And Elkanah was goin&rsquo; to turn you
      out of house and home. The mean, pompous old&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! he&rsquo;s in there with Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Elkanah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they&rsquo;re in the study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the jumpin&rsquo;&mdash;Let me talk to him for a few minutes. I&rsquo;LL tell him
      what&rsquo;s good for his health. You just listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the chair, but she made him sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t to blame. He had to have his rent and
      I didn&rsquo;t feel that I could afford to keep up a whole house, just for
      myself. And, besides, I ought to be thankful to him, I suppose. He got me
      this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did. I rather guess Zeb Mayo or somebody may have suggested it to
      him first, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I rather guess so, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t always tell. Sometimes when you really get inside of a
      person you find a generous streak that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in a Daniels. Anybody that got inside of Elkanah would find nothin&rsquo; 
      but Elkanah there, and &lsquo;twould be crowded at that. So he&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; to the
      new parson, hey? Bossin&rsquo; him, too, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure. Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s young, but he&rsquo;s got a mind of his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hammond chuckled and slapped his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; about that mind. Went
      to the chapel last night, I understand, and he and dad had a set-to. Oh, I
      heard about it! Wish I might have been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does your father act about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bout the way a red-hot stove acts when you spill water on it; every time
      he thinks of the minister he sizzles. Ho, ho! I do wish I could have been
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Grace say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she doesn&rsquo;t say much. I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she felt the way I do,
      though we both keep quiet. I&rsquo;ll tell you, between ourselves and the ship&rsquo;s
      pump, that I sort of glory in the young chap&rsquo;s spunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! So do I. I like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Keziah! I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; frightened. You ain&rsquo;t settin&rsquo; your cap to
      be a parson&rsquo;s wife, are you? Because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I might adopt him, but that&rsquo;s all, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no sense in your slavin&rsquo; yourself to
      death here. I can think of a good deal pleasanter berth than that.
      Pleasanter for me, anyhow, and I&rsquo;d do my best to make it pleasant for you.
      You&rsquo;ve only got to say the word and&mdash;No? Well, then all I can do is
      hope through another voyage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Nat. You know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you don&rsquo;t. But I know. I like you, Nat. I count on you as
      the straightest, truest friend I&rsquo;ve got; and I want to keep on countin&rsquo; on
      you just that way. Mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Course you can, Keziah. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t say another word, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed and looked out at the open door. The kitchen clock ticked loud
      in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;All right, but I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to keep on
      hopin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t, Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah, when you set your foot down you&rsquo;re pretty stubborn; but I&rsquo;ve got
      somethin&rsquo; of a foot myself. You remember you said so a few minutes ago.
      Hi, hum! Well, speakin&rsquo; of dad reminds me that I&rsquo;m kind of worried about
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are? Why? Isn&rsquo;t he well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, but he ain&rsquo;t strong, and he gets too excited over things
      like last night&rsquo;s foolishness. Grace tells me that the doctor says he must
      be careful or he&rsquo;ll drop off sudden some of these days. He had a shock
      five or six years ago, a little one, and I&rsquo;ve been anxious about him ever
      since. I&rsquo;ve got to go to New York off and on for the next month; after
      that I hope to be home for a spell and I can keep an eye on him. Keziah,
      if you&rsquo;ll listen I&rsquo;ll whisper somethin&rsquo; to you&mdash;religion&rsquo;s a good
      thing and so&rsquo;s a mustard plaster, but both of &lsquo;em can be put on too
      strong. Dad is just a little mite crazy on Come-Outers, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I guess not! You mustn&rsquo;t worry. How did Grace look to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the harbor light on a stormy night. She&rsquo;s a brick, that girl, and
      gets prettier every minute. Wonder to me some of the young chaps down here
      don&rsquo;t carry her off by main strength. She&rsquo;ll make somebody a good wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um-hm. Have&mdash;have you ever thought of her that way yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get mad. I think a lot of Grace, and I don&rsquo;t know anyone I&rsquo;d
      rather see you marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Keziah, that&rsquo;s enough of that. Are you and dad in partnership to
      get me spliced and out of the way? He was at me this mornin&rsquo; along the
      same line. Don&rsquo;t say anything like that again, even in fun. YOU know why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right. Now tell me about yourself. Have you had a good
      voyage? How do you like your owners? How did Zach Foster ever get the
      packet in through yesterday&rsquo;s fog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Voyage was all right. Some rugged weather on the trip out, but homeward
      bound we slid along like a slush bucket on a greased plank. Owners are all
      right. Good people as ever I sailed for. As for Zach and the packet&mdash;Ho,
      ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, rocking back and forth on the chair, which creaked in
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; demanded the housekeeper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that! That chair
      wasn&rsquo;t made for elephants to use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? &lsquo;Tis pretty weak in the knees, ain&rsquo;t it? Dad would say &lsquo;twas a piece
      with the creed of those that owned it. I&mdash;What&rsquo;s that? Somebody&rsquo;s
      comin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to clear out. I don&rsquo;t want to be put through my
      catechism yet a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t go. I want you to meet Mr. Ellery. You sit out on the
      wash bench by the back door till I get rid of whoever &lsquo;tis that&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;.
      Scoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat &ldquo;scooted,&rdquo; stopping to snatch up his hat as he ran. Keziah went into
      the dining room and admitted Captain Zebedee Mayo, who was panting from
      the exertion of his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; puffed Captain Zeb, mopping his forehead. &ldquo;How be you, Keziah?
      What? You ain&rsquo;t all alone! Thought you&rsquo;d have a cabin full of gab machines
      by this time. Have they been and gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they haven&rsquo;t been. I&mdash;My land, my pie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rushed into the kitchen and snatched the pastry from the oven. Her new
      caller followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they ain&rsquo;t been, hey?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elkanah&rsquo;s here. He&rsquo;s in there with the minister now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is? Givin&rsquo; the young feller Hail Columby, I cal&rsquo;late. Well, now, he
      shan&rsquo;t. He, he! When they told me how the minister passed old
      hop-and-go-fetch-it what was due him at the chapel last night I riz up and
      hoorayed till my wife shut the windows. She said the neighbors all thought
      I was loony, anyhow, and I needn&rsquo;t prove it to &lsquo;em. He, he! But Elkanah
      ain&rsquo;t got any funny bone. He&rsquo;s as solemn as a stuffed owl, and he&rsquo;ll&mdash;Well,
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to put MY oar in. I&rsquo;m parish committee, too, I cal&rsquo;late, and
      I&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo; to say, even if I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t christened Daniels. Here
      goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He headed for the study, but before he crossed the threshold of the
      kitchen Ellery and his visitor came out into the dining room. Captain
      Elkanah&rsquo;s face was flushed, and he fidgeted. The minister looked
      determined but calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy there, Elkanah!&rdquo; hailed Zebedee cheerfully. &ldquo;&lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Mr. Ellery.
      Been havin&rsquo; officers&rsquo; counsel, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Captain Mayo,&rdquo; said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Zebedee,&rdquo; grunted Elkanah. &ldquo;I have&mdash;hum&mdash;ha!&mdash;been
      discussing the regrettable affair of last night with Mr. Ellery. I have
      tried&mdash;hum&mdash;ha! to show him that respectable people of our
      society don&rsquo;t associate with Come-Outers, and that for a Regular minister
      to go to their meetings is something neither the congregation nor the
      parish committee approves of. No&mdash;er&mdash;hum&mdash;ha! no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I explained to Captain Daniels,&rdquo; observed the minister, &ldquo;that I went
      there for what seemed to me good reasons, and, as they did seem to me good
      at the time, I&rsquo;m not ashamed of having gone. It was an honest mistake on
      my part and I may make more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the society&mdash;&rdquo; began Elkanah. Captain Zeb interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about the society, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he said with emphasis. &ldquo;Nor
      about the parish committee, either. Great fishhooks! the most of us are
      tickled to death over what you said to Eben Hammond. We think it&rsquo;s a
      mighty good joke. YOU didn&rsquo;t know, of course, and what you did was done
      innocent. He! he! he! Did you lay him out, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zebedee,&rdquo; began Captain Daniels, &ldquo;I must say I can&rsquo;t see anything to
      laugh at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never could, Elkanah. I remember that time when you and me and some
      of the fellers home from sea went out sailin&rsquo; and the boom knocked you
      overboard with your Sunday clothes on. Lordy, how the rest of us did
      holler! but you never cracked a smile. If you&rsquo;d seen yourself when we
      hauled you in! whiskers runnin&rsquo; salt water; beaver hat lookin&rsquo; like a
      drownded kitten&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! There! Never mind that. I think you&rsquo;ll find a good many of the
      society feel as I do, shocked and&mdash;hum&mdash;ha!&mdash;sorry. I&rsquo;m
      surprised they haven&rsquo;t been here to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected them,&rdquo; remarked the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; chimed in Captain Zeb. &ldquo;But I cal&rsquo;late to know why they ain&rsquo;t
      been. They&rsquo;re all too busy crowin&rsquo; over the way Nat Hammond fetched the
      packet home last night. WHAT? You ain&rsquo;t heard? Great fishhooks! it&rsquo;s the
      best thing ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about it,&rdquo; snapped Elkanah impatiently. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, I&rsquo;m glad
      you realize that your action was a mistake and I will take pains to have
      that immejitly made plain to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU ain&rsquo;t heard, Keziah, have you?&rdquo; broke in Zebedee. &ldquo;Nor you, Mr.
      Ellery? Well, I must tell you. Here&rsquo;s where I gain a lap on Didama Rogers.
      Seems the Deborah S.&mdash;that&rsquo;s the packet&rsquo;s name, Mr. Ellery&mdash;she
      hauled out of Boston night afore last on the ebb, with a fair wind and sky
      clear as a bell. But they hadn&rsquo;t much more&rsquo;n got outside of Minot&rsquo;s &lsquo;fore
      the fog shut down, thicker&rsquo;n gruel for a sick rich man. The wind held till
      &lsquo;long toward mornin&rsquo;; then she flattened to a dead calm. &lsquo;Bije Perry, the
      mate, he spun the yarn to me, and he said &lsquo;twas thick and flat as ever he
      see and kept gettin&rsquo; no better fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They drifted along till noon time and then they was somewheres out in the
      bay, but that&rsquo;s about all you could say. Zach, he was stewin&rsquo; and
      sputterin&rsquo; like a pair of fried eels, and Lafayette Gage and Emulous
      Peters&mdash;they&rsquo;re Denboro folks, Mr. Ellery, and about sixteen p&rsquo;ints
      t&rsquo;other side of no account&mdash;they was the only passengers aboard
      except Nat Hammond, and they put in their time playin&rsquo; high low jack in
      the cabin. The lookout was for&rsquo;ard tootin&rsquo; a tin horn and his bellerin&rsquo; 
      was the most excitin&rsquo; thing goin&rsquo; on. After dinner&mdash;corned beef and
      cabbage&mdash;trust Zach for that, though it&rsquo;s next door to cannibalism to
      put cabbage in HIS mouth&mdash;after dinner all hands was on deck when Nat
      says: &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I hear somethin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They listened, and then they all heard it&mdash;all &lsquo;cept Zach, who&rsquo;s
      deef in his larboard ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Stand by!&rsquo; roars Nat. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a squall, dead astern and comin&rsquo; abilin&rsquo;!
      I&rsquo;ll take her, &lsquo;Bije. You look out for them tops&rsquo;ls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Nat grabs the wheel and &lsquo;Bije tears for&rsquo;ard and sends the two fo&rsquo;mast
      hands aloft on the jump. Zach was skipper, but all he done was race around
      and holler and trip over his own feet. Oh, he&rsquo;s a prize sailor, he is!
      Don&rsquo;t talk to me about them Fosters! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is talkin&rsquo; about &lsquo;em but you, Zeb,&rdquo; observed Keziah drily. &ldquo;Go on.
      How about the squall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hit &lsquo;em &lsquo;fore they got even one tops&rsquo;l clewed down. That one, the
      foretops&rsquo;l &lsquo;twas, split to rags. The main tops&rsquo;l was set, and when the
      squall struck, the rotten old topmast went by the board &lsquo;Kerrash-o!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Course splinters flew like all possessed, and one of &lsquo;em, about a foot
      long, sailed past Nat&rsquo;s head, where he stood heavin&rsquo; his whole weight on
      the wheel, and lit right on the binnacle, smashin&rsquo; it to matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Nat never paid the least attention, no more&rsquo;n if the chunk of
      wood had been a June bug buzzin&rsquo; past. He just held that wheel hard down
      and that saved the packet. She come around and put her nose dead in the
      wind just in time. As &lsquo;twas, &lsquo;Bije says there was a second when the water
      by her lee rail looked right underneath him as he hung onto the deck with
      finger nails and teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there they was, afloat, but with their upper riggin&rsquo; gone and the
      compass smashed flat. A howlin&rsquo; no&rsquo;thwester blowin&rsquo; and fog thick as ever.
      Zach was a whimperin&rsquo;, fidgetin&rsquo; old woman, Lafayette and Emulous was
      prayin&rsquo; in the scuppers&mdash;and that ain&rsquo;t an exercise they&rsquo;re used to,
      neither&mdash;and even &lsquo;Bije was mighty shook up and worried&mdash;he says
      he was himself. But Nat Hammond was as cool and refreshin&rsquo; as the bottom
      of my well up home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Better clear away that mess aloft, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; he says to the skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zach said he guessed so; he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sure of nothin&rsquo;. However, they cleared
      it away, and incidentally &lsquo;Bije yanked the prayer meetin&rsquo; out of the
      scuppers and set &lsquo;em to work. Then Nat suggests gettin&rsquo; the spare compass
      and, lo and behold you! there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any. Compasses cost money and money&rsquo;s
      made to keep, so Zach thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there they was. Wind was fair, or ought to be, but &lsquo;twas blowin&rsquo; hard
      and so thick you couldn&rsquo;t hardly see the jib boom. Zach he wanted to
      anchor, then he didn&rsquo;t, then he did, and so on. Nobody paid much attention
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;ll we do, Nat?&rsquo; says &lsquo;Bije. He knew who was the real seaman aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Keep her as she is, dead afore it, if you ask me, says Nat. &lsquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll
      hit the broadside of the cape somewheres if this gale holds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they kept her as she was. And it got to be night and they knew they&rsquo;d
      ought to be &lsquo;most onto the edge of the flats off here, if their reck&rsquo;nin&rsquo; 
      was nigh right. They hove the lead and got five fathom. No flats about
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zach was for anchorin&rsquo; again. &lsquo;What do you think, Nat?&rsquo; asks &lsquo;Bije.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Anchor, of course, if you want to,&rsquo; Nat says. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; this
      craft. I&rsquo;m only passenger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But what do you THINK?&rsquo; whines Zach. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell us what you do
      think?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, if &lsquo;twas me, I wouldn&rsquo;t anchor till I had to. Prob&rsquo;ly &lsquo;twill fair
      off to-morrow, but if it shouldn&rsquo;t, we might have to lay out here all day.
      Anyhow, we&rsquo;d have to wait for a full tide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re off the course,&rsquo; says &lsquo;Bije, else we&rsquo;d been acrost the
      bar by this time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; Nat tells him, &lsquo;if we are off the course and too far inshore, we
      would have made the bar&mdash;the Bayport bar&mdash;if not the Trumet one.
      And if we&rsquo;re off the course and too far out, we&rsquo;d ought to have deeper
      water than five fathom, hadn&rsquo;t we? &lsquo;Course I&rsquo;m not sure, but&mdash;What&rsquo;s
      that, lands-man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Three and a half, sir,&rsquo; says the feller with the lead. That showed they
      was edgin&rsquo; in somewheres. Nat he sniffed, for all the world like a dog
      catchin&rsquo; a scent, so &lsquo;Bije declares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can smell home,&rsquo; he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three fathom the lead give &lsquo;em, then two and a half, then a scant two.
      They was drawin&rsquo; six feet. Zach couldn&rsquo;t stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to anchor,&rsquo; he squeals, frantic. &lsquo;I believe we&rsquo;re plumb over
      to Wellmouth and drivin&rsquo; right onto Horsefoot Shoal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s either that or the bar,&rsquo; chimes in &lsquo;Bije. &lsquo;And whichever &lsquo;tis, we
      can&rsquo;t anchor in the middle of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But what&rsquo;ll we do?&rsquo; shouts Zach. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t nobody say somethin&rsquo; to DO?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tell you I smell home,&rsquo; says Nat, calm and chipper, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;d know that
      smell if I met it in Jericho. Ha! there she deepens again. That was the
      bar and we&rsquo;re over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind had gone down to a stiff sailin&rsquo; breeze, and the old Debby S.
      slapped along afore it. Sometimes there was twelve foot under her keel and
      sometimes eight or nine. Once &lsquo;twas only seven and a half. Zach and &lsquo;Bije
      both looked at each other, but Nat only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, you can laugh!&rsquo; hollers Zach. &lsquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t your vessel you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; 
      into danger. YOU aint paid out your good money&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat never answered; but he stopped smilin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all to once the water deepened. Hammond swung her up into the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;NOW you can anchor,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And &lsquo;bout time, too, I guess,&rsquo; says &lsquo;Bije. &lsquo;I cal&rsquo;late the skipper&rsquo;s
      right. This IS Horsefoot and we&rsquo;re right between the shoals. Yes, sir, and
      I hear breakers. Lively there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hove over the mudhook and dropped the sails. Nat shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Breakers or not,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve smelt home for the last half
      hour. Now, by the jumpin&rsquo; Moses, I can TASTE it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And inside of a couple of shakes come the rain. It poured for a while and
      then the fog cleared. Right acrost their bows was Trumet, with the town
      clock strikin&rsquo; ten. Over the flat place between the hills they could see
      the light on the ocean side. And they was anchored right in the deep hole
      inside the breakwater, as sure as I&rsquo;m knee high to a marlin spike!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bije just stared at Hammond with his mouth open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nat,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a seaman, if I do say it. I thought I was a
      pretty good bay pilot, but I can&rsquo;t steer a vessel without a compass
      through a night as black as Pharaoh&rsquo;s Egypt, and in a thick fog besides,
      and land her square on top of her moorin&rsquo;s. If my hat wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sloshin&rsquo; 
      around thirty mile astern, I snum if I wouldn&rsquo;t take it off to you this
      minute!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nat,&rsquo; stammers Zach, &lsquo;I must say I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat snapped him shut like a tobacco box. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;But
      I&rsquo;ll say this to you, Zach Foster. When I undertake to handle a vessel I
      handle her best I know how, and the fact that I don&rsquo;t own her makes no
      difference to me. You just put that down somewheres so you won&rsquo;t forget
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; crowed Captain Zebedee, concluding his long yarn,
      &ldquo;after that, mind you, that lubber Zach Foster is around town tellin&rsquo; 
      folks that his schooner had been over the course so often she COULDN&rsquo;T get
      lost. She found her way home herself. WHAT do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two members of the parish committee left the parsonage soon after
      Captain Mayo had finished his story. Elkanah had listened with growing
      irritation and impatience. Zebedee lingered a moment behind his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself about what happened last night, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he
      whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right. &lsquo;Course nobody&rsquo;d want you to keep up
      chummin&rsquo; in with Come-Outers, but what you said to old Eben&rsquo;ll square you
      this time. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister shut the door behind his departing guests. Then he went out
      into the kitchen, whither the housekeeper had preceded him. He found her
      standing on the back step, looking across the fields. The wash bench was
      untenanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; mused Ellery thoughtfully, &ldquo;that was a good story of Captain
      Mayo&rsquo;s. This man Hammond must be a fine chap. I should like to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah still looked away over the fields. She did not wish her employer to
      see her face&mdash;just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would meet him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was here a little while ago
      and I asked him to wait. I guess Zeb&rsquo;s yarn was too much for him; he
      doesn&rsquo;t like to be praised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Was he here? At the Regular parsonage? I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and I have known each other for a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s gone. I think I should like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah turned from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you would,&rdquo; she said.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH CAPTAIN NAT PICKS UP A DERELICT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is probable that John Ellery never fully realized the debt of gratitude
      he owed to the fog and the squall and to Captain Nat Hammond. Trumet,
      always hungry for a sensation, would have thoroughly enjoyed arguing and
      quarreling over the minister&rsquo;s visit to Come-Outer meeting, and, during
      the fracas, Keziah&rsquo;s parson might have been more or less battered. But
      Captain Nat&rsquo;s brilliant piloting of the old packet was a bit of seamanship
      which every man and woman on that foam-bordered stretch of sand could
      understand and appreciate, and the minister&rsquo;s indiscretion was all but
      forgotten in consequence. The &ldquo;Daily Advertisers&rdquo; gloated over it, of
      course, and Captain Elkanah brought it up at the meeting of the parish
      committee, but there Captain Zeb Mayo championed the young man&rsquo;s course
      and proclaimed that, fur&rsquo;s he was concerned, he was for Mr. Ellery more&rsquo;n
      ever. &ldquo;A young greenhorn with the spunk to cruise single-handed right into
      the middle of the Come-Outer school and give an old bull whale like Eben
      the gaff is the man for my money,&rdquo; declared Zebedee. Most of his
      fellow-committee agreed with him. &ldquo;Not guilty, but don&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; was
      the general verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Come-Outers, they professed to believe that their leader had
      much the best of the encounter, so they were satisfied. There was a note
      of triumph and exultation in the &ldquo;testimony&rdquo; given on the following
      Thursday night, and Captain Eben divided his own discourse between
      thankfulness for his son&rsquo;s safe return and glorification at the
      discomfiture of the false prophets. Practically, then, the result of
      Ellery&rsquo;s peace overture was an increased bitterness in the feeling between
      the two societies and a polishing of weapons on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah watched anxiously for a hint concerning her parson&rsquo;s walk in the
      rain with Grace, but she heard nothing, so congratulated herself that the
      secret had been kept. Ellery did not again mention it to her, nor she to
      him. A fortnight later he preached his great sermon on &ldquo;The Voyage of
      Life,&rdquo; and its reference to gales and calms and lee shores and breakers
      made a hit. His popularity took a big jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Nat Hammond during that fortnight. The first meeting was
      accompanied by unusual circumstances, which might have been serious, but
      were actually only funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide at Trumet, on the bay side, goes out for a long way, leaving
      uncovered a mile and a half of flats, bare and sandy, or carpeted with
      seaweed. Between these flats are the channels, varying at low water from
      two to four feet in depth, but deepening rapidly as the tide flows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flats fascinated the young minister, as they have many another visitor
      to the Cape, before or since. On cloudy days they lowered with a dull,
      leaden luster and the weed-grown portions were like the dark squares on a
      checkerboard, while the deep water beyond the outer bar was steely gray
      and angry. When the sun shone and the wind blew clear from the northwest
      the whole expanse flashed into fire and color, sapphire blue, emerald
      green, topaz yellow, dotted with white shells and ablaze with diamond
      sparkles where the reflected light leaped from the flint crystals of the
      wet, coarse sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best time to visit the flats&mdash;tide serving, of course&mdash;is
      the early morning at sunrise. Then there is an inspiration in the wide
      expanse, a snap and tang and joy in the air. Ellery had made up his mind
      to take a before-breakfast tramp to the outer bar and so arose at five,
      tucked a borrowed pair of fisherman&rsquo;s boots beneath his arm, and, without
      saying anything to his housekeeper, walked down the lawn behind the
      parsonage, climbed the rail fence, and &ldquo;cut across lots&rdquo; to the pine grove
      on the bluff. There he removed his shoes, put on the boots, wallowed
      through the mealy yellow sand forming the slope of the bluff, and came out
      on the white beach and the inner edge of the flats. Then he plashed on,
      bound out to where the fish weirs stood, like webby fences, in the
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wonderful walk on a wonderful day. The minister enjoyed every
      minute of it. Out here he could forget the petty trials of life, the
      Didamas and Elkanahs. The wind blew his hat off and dropped it in a
      shallow channel, but he splashed to the rescue and laughed aloud as he
      fished it out. It was not much wetter than it had been that night of the
      rain, when he tried to lend his umbrella and didn&rsquo;t succeed. This
      reflection caused him to halt in his walk and look backward toward the
      shore. The brown roof of the old tavern was blushing red in the first rays
      of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cart, drawn by a plodding horse and with a single individual on its high
      seat, was moving out from behind the breakwater. Some fisherman driving
      out his weir, probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sand of the outer bar was dimpled and mottled like watered silk by the
      action of the waves. It sloped gradually down to meet the miniature
      breakers that rolled over and slid in ripples along its edge. Ellery
      wandered up and down, picking up shells and sea clams, and peering through
      the nets of the nearest weir at the &ldquo;horsefoot crabs&rdquo; and squid and
      flounders imprisoned in the pound. There were a few bluefish there, also,
      and a small school of mackerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister had been on the bar a considerable time before he began to
      think of returning to the shore. He was hungry, but was enjoying himself
      too well to mind. The flats were all his that morning. Only the cart and
      its driver were in sight and they were half a mile off. He looked at his
      watch, sighed, and reluctantly started to walk toward the town; he mustn&rsquo;t
      keep Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s breakfast waiting TOO long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first channel he came to was considerably deeper than when he forded
      it on the way out. He noticed this, but only vaguely. The next, however,
      was so deep that the water splashed in at the top of one of his boots. He
      did notice that, because though he was not wearing his best clothes, he
      was not anxious to wet his &ldquo;other ones.&rdquo; The extent of his wardrobe was in
      keeping with the size of his salary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the third channel was so wide and deep that he saw at once it could
      not be forded, unless he was willing to plunge above his waist. This was
      provoking. Now he realized that he had waited too long. The tide had been
      flowing for almost an hour; it had flowed fast and, as he should have
      remembered, having been told, the principal channels were eight feet deep
      before the highest flats were covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried along the edge, looking for a shallower place, but found none.
      At last he reached the point of the flat he was on and saw, to his dismay,
      that here was the deepest spot yet, a hole, scoured out by a current like
      a mill race. Turning, he saw, creeping rapidly and steadily together over
      the flat behind him, two lines of foam, one from each channel. His retreat
      was cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in for a wetting, that was sure. However, there was no help for it,
      so he waded in. The water filled his boots there, it gurgled about his
      hips, and beyond, as he could see, it seemed to grow deeper and deeper.
      The current was surprisingly strong; he found it difficult to keep his
      footing in the soft sand. It looked as though he must swim for it, and to
      swim in that tide would be no joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, from behind him, came a hail. He turned and saw moving toward him
      through the shallow water now covering the flat beyond the next channel,
      the cart he had seen leave the shore by the packet wharf, and, later, on
      the outer bar. The horse was jogging along, miniature geysers spouting
      beneath its hoofs. The driver waved to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, mate,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Belay there. Stay where you are. I&rsquo;ll be
      alongside in a shake. Git dap, January!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery waded back to meet this welcome arrival. The horse plunged into the
      next channel, surged through it, and emerged dripping. The driver pulled
      the animal into a walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cruisin&rsquo; your way; better get aboard, hadn&rsquo;t you?
      There&rsquo;s kind of a heavy dew this mornin&rsquo;. Whoa, Bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; or &ldquo;January&rdquo; stopped with apparent willingness. The driver leaned
      down and extended a hand. The minister took it and was pulled up to the
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you. I guess you saved me from a
      ducking, if nothing worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I did. This ain&rsquo;t Saturday
      night and &lsquo;twould be against Trumet principles to take a bath any other
      time. All taut, are you? Good enough! then we&rsquo;ll get under way.&rdquo; He
      flapped the reins and added, &ldquo;G&rsquo;long, Julius Caesar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse, a sturdy, sedate beast to whom all names seemed to be alike,
      picked up his feet and pounded them down again. Showers of spray flew
      about the heads of the pair on the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure about that duckin&rsquo;,&rdquo; commented the rescuer. &ldquo;Hum! I guess
      likely we&rsquo;ll be out of soundin&rsquo;s if we tackle that sink hole you was
      undertakin&rsquo; to navigate. Let&rsquo;s try it a little further down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery looked his companion over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he observed with a smile, &ldquo;from what I&rsquo;ve heard of you, Captain
      Hammond, I rather guess you could navigate almost any water in this
      locality and in all sorts of weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver turned in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You know me, do you? That&rsquo;s funny. I was tryin&rsquo; to
      locate you, but I ain&rsquo;t been able to. You ain&rsquo;t a Trumetite I&rsquo;ll bet on
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! tut! tut! you don&rsquo;t tell me. Say, shipmate, you hurt my pride. I did
      think there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a soul that ever trod sand in this village that I
      couldn&rsquo;t name on sight, and give the port they hailed from and the names
      of their owners. But you&rsquo;ve got me on my beam ends. And yet you knew ME.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did. Everybody knows the man that brought the packet home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat Hammond sniffed impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late everybody does, and knows a lot
      more about that foolishness than I do myself. If ever a craft was steered
      by guess and by godfrey, &lsquo;twas that old hooker of Zach&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other night.
      Well&mdash;Humph! here&rsquo;s another piece of pilotin&rsquo; that bids fair to be a
      mighty sight harder. Heave ahead, Hannibal! hope you&rsquo;ve got your web feet
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had moved along the edge of the flat a short distance and now turned
      into the channel. The horse was wading above its knees; soon the water
      reached its belly and began to flow into the body of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick up your feet, shipmate,&rdquo; commanded Nat. &ldquo;You may get rheumatiz if
      you don&rsquo;t. This&rsquo;ll be a treat for those sea clams back in that bucket
      amidships. They&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;ve repented and have decided to turn &lsquo;em loose
      again. They don&rsquo;t know how long I&rsquo;ve been countin&rsquo; on a sea-clam pie. I&rsquo;ll
      fetch those clams ashore if I have to lug &lsquo;em with my teeth. Steady, all
      hands! we&rsquo;re off the ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cart was afloat. The horse, finding wading more difficult than
      swimming, began to swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m skipper again, sure enough,&rdquo; remarked Hammond. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; 
      seasick, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! she keeps on a fairly even keel, considerin&rsquo; her build. THERE she
      strikes! That&rsquo;ll do, January; you needn&rsquo;t try for a record voyage.
      Walkin&rsquo;s more in your line than playin&rsquo; steamboat. We&rsquo;re over the worst of
      it now. Say! you and I didn&rsquo;t head for port any too soon, did we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I should say not. I ought to have known better than to wait out there
      so long. I&rsquo;ve been warned about this tide. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sh-sh! YOU ought to have known better! What do you think of me? Born
      and brought up within sight and smell of this salt puddle and let myself
      in for a scrape like this! But it was so mighty fine off there on the bar
      I couldn&rsquo;t bear to leave it. I always said that goin&rsquo; to sea on land would
      be the ideal way, and now I&rsquo;ve tried it. But you took bigger chances than
      I did. Are you a good swimmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too good. I hardly know what might have happened if you hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sh-sh! that&rsquo;s all right. Always glad to pick up a derelict, may be a
      chance for salvage, you know. Here&rsquo;s the last channel and it&rsquo;s an easy
      one. There! now it&rsquo;s plain sailin&rsquo; for dry ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old horse, breathing heavily from his exertions, trotted over the
      stretch of yet uncovered flats and soon mounted the slope of the beach.
      The minister prepared to alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hammond,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t asked me my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I seldom do more&rsquo;n once. There have been times when I&rsquo;D just as soon
      cruise without too big letters alongside my figurehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my name is Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? WHAT? Oh, ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rocked back and forth on the seat. The minister&rsquo;s feelings were a bit
      hurt, though he tried not to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind my laughin&rsquo;,&rdquo; explained Nat, still chuckling. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t
      at you. It&rsquo;s just because I was wonderin&rsquo; what you&rsquo;d look like if I should
      meet you and now&mdash;Ho! ho! You see, Mr. Ellery, I&rsquo;ve heard of you,
      same as you said you&rsquo;d heard of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery smiled, but not too broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I imagined you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, seems to me dad mentioned your name once or twice. As much as that,
      anyhow. Wonder what he&rsquo;d say if he knew his son had been takin&rsquo; you for a
      mornin&rsquo; ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably that it would have been much better to have left me where you
      found me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s jolly face grew serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Not so bad as that. Dad wouldn&rsquo;t drown anybody,
      not even a Regular minister. He&rsquo;s a pretty square-built old craft, even
      though his spiritual chart may be laid out different from yours&mdash;and
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From yours? Why, I supposed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. Well, WHEN I go to meetin&rsquo;, I generally go to the chapel to
      please father. But when it comes right down to a confession of faith, I&rsquo;m
      pretty broad in the beam. Maybe I&rsquo;d be too broad even for you, Mr.
      Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister, who had jumped to the ground, looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hammond,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad indeed that I met you. Not
      alone because you helped me out of a bad scrape; I realize how bad it
      might have been and that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shsh! shh! Nothin&rsquo; at all. Don&rsquo;t be foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad, too, because I&rsquo;ve heard so many good things about you that
      I was sure you must be worth knowing. I hope you won&rsquo;t believe I went to
      your father&rsquo;s meeting with any&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Jumpin&rsquo; Moses, man! I don&rsquo;t find fault with you for that. I
      understand, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t mind the fact that I am what I am, I&rsquo;d like to shake
      hands with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat reached down a big brown hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Always glad to shake with a chap as well
      recommended as you are. Yes, indeed, I mean it. You see, you&rsquo;ve got a
      friend that&rsquo;s a friend of mine, and when she guarantees a man to be A. B.,
      I&rsquo;ll ship him without any more questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, good-by. I hope we shall meet again and often. And I
      certainly thank you for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Maybe you&rsquo;ll fish ME out of the drink some day; you
      never can tell. So long! Git dap, Gen&rsquo;ral Scott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove off up the beach, but before he turned the corner of the nearest
      dune he called back over his shoulder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Mr. Ellery, if you think of it you might give my regards to&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;the
      lady that&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; house for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast had waited nearly an hour when the minister reached home.
      Keziah, also, was waiting and evidently much relieved at his safe arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she met him at the back door. &ldquo;Where in
      the world have you been, Mr. Ellery? Soakin&rsquo; wet again, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery replied that he had been for a walk out to the bar. He sat down on
      the step to remove the borrowed boots. A small rivulet of salt water
      poured from each as he pulled them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a walk! A swim, you mean. How could you get in up to your waist if
      you just walked? Did you fall down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly. But I waited too long and the tide headed me off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us! you mustn&rsquo;t take chances on that tide. If you&rsquo;d told me you
      was goin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d have warned you to hurry back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been warned often enough. It was my own fault, as usual. I&rsquo;m not
      sure that I don&rsquo;t need a guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! well, I ain&rsquo;t sure either. Was the channels very deep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deep enough. The fact is, that I might have got into serious trouble if I
      hadn&rsquo;t been picked up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told briefly the story of his morning&rsquo;s adventure. The housekeeper
      listened with growing excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens to Betsy!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Was the channel you planned to swim
      the one at the end of the flat by the longest weir leader?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul! there&rsquo;s been two men drowned in that very place at half tide.
      And they were good swimmers. After this I shan&rsquo;t dare let you out of my
      sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Was it as risky as that? Why, Captain Hammond didn&rsquo;t tell me so. I
      must owe him more even than I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess you do. He wouldn&rsquo;t tell you, though; that ain&rsquo;t his way.
      Deary me! for what we&rsquo;ve received let us be thankful. And that reminds me
      that biscuits ought to be et when they&rsquo;re first made, not after they&rsquo;ve
      been dried up on the back of the stove forever and ever amen. Go on and
      change those wet things of yours and then we&rsquo;ll eat. Tryin&rsquo; to swim the
      main channel on the flood! My soul and body!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Nat sent his regards to you, Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; said the minister,
      moving toward the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, hey?&rdquo; was the housekeeper&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;Want to know!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE PARSON AND MR. PEPPER DECLARE THEIR INDEPENDENCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      That afternoon, when dinner was over, the Reverend John decided to make a
      few duty calls. The first of these he determined should be on the Peppers.
      Lavinia and her brother had called at the Parsonage several times, but as
      yet he had not paid them a visit. It was not a ceremony to which he looked
      forward with delight, but it must be performed. Miss Pepper had hinted
      several times, at sewing circle and after prayer meeting, of &ldquo;partiality&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;only stoppin&rsquo; in where they had fancy curtains up to the windows.&rdquo;
       So, as it could not be put off longer, without causing trouble, he
      determined to go through with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pepper house was situated just off the main road on the lane leading
      over the dunes to the ocean and the light. It was a small building, its
      white paint dingy and storm beaten, and its little fenced-in front yard
      dotted thickly with clumps of silver-leaf saplings. A sign, nailed
      crookedly on a post, informed those seeking such information that within
      was to be found &ldquo;Abishai G. W. Pepper, Tax Collector, Assessor, Boots and
      Shoes Repaired.&rdquo; And beneath this was fastened a shingle with the chalked
      notice, &ldquo;Salt Hay for sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boot and shoe portion of the first sign was a relic of other days.
      Kyan had been a cobbler once, but it is discouraging to wait three or four
      weeks while the pair of boots one has left to be resoled are forgotten in
      a corner. Captain Zeb Mayo&rsquo;s pointed comment, &ldquo;I want my shoe leather to
      wear while I&rsquo;m alive, not to be laid out in after I die of old age,&rdquo;
       expressed the general feeling of the village and explained why custom had
      left Mr. Pepper and flown to the more enterprising shoemaker at &ldquo;The
      Corners.&rdquo; The tax collectorship might have followed it, but here Lavinia
      kept her brother up to the mark. She went with him on his rounds and it
      gave her opportunity to visit, and afterwards comment upon, every family
      in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister walked up the dusty lane, lifted the Pepper gate and swung it
      back on its one hinge, shooed away the three or four languid and
      discouraged-looking fowls that were taking a sun bath on the clam-shell
      walk, and knocked at the front door. No one coming in answer to the knock,
      he tried again. Then he discovered a rusty bell pull and gave it a sharp
      tug. The knob came off in his hand and he hurriedly thrust it back again
      into its place. Evidently, that bell was solely for ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the conclusion that no one was at home and felt a guilty sense
      of relief in consequence. But his conscience would not let him depart
      without another try, so he clenched his fist and gave the cracked door
      panel a series of tremendous thumps. A thin black cat, which had evidently
      been asleep beneath the step, burst from its concealment and fled in
      frantic terror. Then from somewhere in the rear of the house came the
      sound of a human voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; it called faintly. &ldquo;Whoever you be, don&rsquo;t bust that door down. Come
      round here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery walked around the corner of the building. The voice came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; it wailed, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you answer? Be you comin&rsquo;? If you&rsquo;re a
      peddler, you needn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a peddler,&rdquo; was the minister&rsquo;s amused reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t ye? All right. Come along, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery &ldquo;came along&rdquo; as far as the angle where the ell joined the main body
      of the house. So far as he could see every door and window was closed and
      there were no signs of life. However, he stepped to the door, a
      green-painted affair of boards, and ventured another knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start that poundin&rsquo; again!&rdquo; protested the voice. &ldquo;Come round to
      t&rsquo;other side where I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So around went the Reverend John, smiling broadly. But even on &ldquo;t&rsquo;other
      side&rdquo; there was no one to be seen. And no door, for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed the voice, &ldquo;if &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t Mr. Ellery! How d&rsquo;ye do? Glad to
      see you, Mr. Ellery. Fine day, ain&rsquo;t it? Here I be at this window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough; one of the windows on this side of the house was raised about
      six inches at the bottom, the shade was up, and peering beneath the sash
      the minister discerned the expressive features of Abishai Pepper&mdash;or
      as much of those features as the size of the opening permitted to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the visitor, &ldquo;is that you, Mr. Pepper? Well, I&rsquo;m glad to
      see you, at last. You are rather hard to see, even now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan was plainly embarrassed. He stammered as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;I&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I be. How be you? Pretty
      smart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you. I&rsquo;m well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;come to call, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, that was my intention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Er&mdash;er&mdash;Laviny, she&rsquo;s gone over to Thankful Payne&rsquo;s. She
      heard that Thankful&rsquo;s cousin up to Middleboro had died&mdash;passed away,
      I mean&mdash;and she thought she&rsquo;d run over and find out if Thankful was
      willed anything. She said she&rsquo;d be back pretty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then, as she won&rsquo;t be gone long, perhaps I&rsquo;ll come in and
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was moving away toward the corner when a shout from beneath the window
      sash brought him to a halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; called Abishai. &ldquo;Hi, Mr. Ellery! don&rsquo;t go to that door. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no
      use; it&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked? Well, you can unlock it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very well. That is, I&mdash;Mr. Ellery, come back here, won&rsquo;t ye?
      I don&rsquo;t want anybody to hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house of the nearest neighbor being several hundred yards away, the
      likelihood of being overheard was improbable; but the minister came back,
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; stammered Kyan, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to have you come
      in fust rate, but&mdash;er&mdash;Laviny she&rsquo;s got the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm, she&rsquo;s got it. She took it with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are other doors. She didn&rsquo;t take them all, did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o, but&mdash;Well, the fact is, Mr. Ellery, I&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      locked in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Locked in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, locked in this room. She&mdash;she&mdash;Oh, consarn it all, Mr.
      Ellery, she&rsquo;s locked me in this room a-purpose, so&rsquo;s I won&rsquo;t get out and
      go somewheres without her knowin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;h&rsquo;m; that&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s done. Did you ever hear of anything like
      that in your born days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This surprising disclosure was funny enough, but the tone of grieved
      indignation in which Mr. Pepper told of his imprisonment was funnier
      still. The minister coughed violently and looked the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She done it a-purpose,&rdquo; continued Kyan, in a burst of confidence. &ldquo;She
      had me put one of them new-fangled spring locks on the door of this room
      t&rsquo;other day, &lsquo;cause she said she was afraid of tramps and wanted some
      place to shut herself up in if one of em come. And&mdash;and after dinner
      to-day she sent me in here for somethin&rsquo; and then slammed the door on me.
      Said she cal&rsquo;lated I&rsquo;d stay put till she got back from Thankful&rsquo;s. She
      knew mighty well I couldn&rsquo;t get out of the window, &lsquo;cause it won&rsquo;t open no
      further&rsquo;n &lsquo;tis now. I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t never so provoked in my life. &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no way
      to treat your own brother, lockin&rsquo; him up like a young one; now, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery&rsquo;s reply was not made immediately. He had heard numerous stories
      concerning this odd household, some of which seemed too absurd for belief.
      But this performance was more ridiculous than anything he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t right, is it, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo; demanded Kyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the caller chokingly, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;it is rather
      unusual, that&rsquo;s a fact. May I ask what you&rsquo;ve done to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done? I ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo;. She&rsquo;s so darned scared some other woman&rsquo;ll
      get my money that&mdash;you see, a month or so ago I&mdash;I&mdash;well,
      she thought I done somethin&rsquo;, or was plannin&rsquo; to do somethin&rsquo; that&mdash;Keziah
      Coffin never told you anything about me, did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. What could Mrs. Coffin tell me about you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;. Only if she did, tain&rsquo;t so. But I ain&rsquo;t
      goin&rsquo; to stand it no more, Mr. Ellery. Bein&rsquo; shut up in a darned old&mdash;excuse
      my swearin&rsquo;, I didn&rsquo;t mean to, though I got reason enough, land knows&mdash;bein&rsquo; 
      shut up in a room full of trunks and odds and ends is goin&rsquo; too fur. I
      never want to smell old clothes ag&rsquo;in long&rsquo;s I live. Would you stand it if
      you was me, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I mustn&rsquo;t interfere in your family matters, Mr. Pepper.
      Perhaps I&rsquo;d better call some other time. Good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! hold on! you ain&rsquo;t answered me yet. You&rsquo;re a minister and I go
      to your meetin&rsquo; house. Tell me what you&rsquo;d do if you was me. Would you
      stand it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet you wouldn&rsquo;t! What would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. You&rsquo;re of age, Mr. Pepper, and you must decide for
      yourself. I think I should declare my independence. Really, I must go. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry. I want advice. I need it. And, so fur&rsquo;s
      DECLARIN&rsquo; goes, that don&rsquo;t do me no good. She can declare more things in a
      minute than I can think of in a week. Tongue! I never heard&mdash;No, no!
      Never mind the declarin&rsquo;. What would you DO? S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; you wanted to go
      outdoor without havin&rsquo; her tagged to your coat tails, how&rsquo;d you stop the
      taggin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The absurdity of the affair was too much for the visitor. He roared a &ldquo;Ha,
      ha!&rdquo; that caused Abishai to wave a warning hand beneath the sash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ss-h-h! sshh!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Folks&rsquo;ll hear ye, and I&rsquo;d be so ashamed if
      they did that I wouldn&rsquo;t dast to show my head. Can&rsquo;t show much of it,
      anyhow, just now. By gum! I&rsquo;ll do somethin&rsquo; desperate. I&mdash;I dunno as
      I won&rsquo;t pizen her. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! you mustn&rsquo;t talk that way. I&rsquo;m afraid you must be very
      fascinating, Mr. Pepper. If your sister is so very fearful of your meeting
      other women, it must be because she has good reason to fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your foolishness! Oh!&mdash;I&mdash;I ask your pardon, Mr. Ellery.
      That ain&rsquo;t no way to talk to a minister. But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to go out when I
      want to if I bust a hole through the clapboards. I AIN&rsquo;T fascinatin&rsquo;. You
      ask any woman&mdash;except her&mdash;if I be, and see what they say.
      What&rsquo;ll I DO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha! I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. You might lock HER up, I suppose, just
      for a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; There was a sound from behind the pane as if the imprisoned one had
      slapped his knee. &ldquo;By gum! I never thought of that. Would you now, Mr.
      Ellery? Would you? Sshh! sshh! somebody&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;s her. Run
      around to the door, Mr. Ellery, quick. And don&rsquo;t tell her I&rsquo;ve seen you,
      for mercy sakes! Don&rsquo;t now, will ye? Please! Run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister did not run, but he walked briskly around the corner. Sure
      enough, Lavinia was there, just unlocking the door. She expressed herself
      as very glad to see the caller, ushered him into the sitting room and
      disappeared, returning in another moment with her brother, whom she
      unblushingly said had been taking a nap. Abishai did not contradict her;
      instead, he merely looked apprehensively at the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call was a short one. Lavinia did seven eighths of the talking and
      Ellery the rest. Kyan was silent. When the visit was over, Miss Pepper
      escorted her guest to the door and bade him a voluble good-by. Over her
      shoulder the minister saw Kyan making frantic signs to him; he interpreted
      the signals as a request for secrecy concerning the interview by the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times during the remainder of that week he surprised his
      housekeeper by suddenly laughing aloud when there was, apparently, nothing
      to laugh at. He explained these outbursts by saying that he had thought of
      something funny. Keziah suggested that it must be mighty funny to make him
      laugh in the middle of sermon writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard sermons that were funny,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though they wasn&rsquo;t
      intended to be; but what I&rsquo;ve heard of yours ain&rsquo;t that kind. I wish you&rsquo;d
      let me in on the joke. I haven&rsquo;t been feelin&rsquo; like laughin&rsquo; for the last
      fortni&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been rather grave and preoccupied, for her, of late. Bustling and
      busy she always was, never sitting down to &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; as she called it,
      without a lap full of sewing. The minister&rsquo;s clothes were mended and his
      socks darned as they had not been since his mother&rsquo;s day. And with him, at
      meal times, or after supper in the sitting room, she was always cheerful
      and good-humored. But he had heard her sigh at her work, and once, when
      she thought herself unobserved, he saw her wipe her eyes with her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she protested, when he asked if anything had gone wrong. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      all right. Got a little cold or somethin&rsquo;, I guess, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not give any other explanation and absolutely refused to see the
      doctor. Ellery did not press the matter. He believed the &ldquo;cold&rdquo; to be but
      an excuse and wondered what the real trouble might be. It seemed to him to
      date from the evening of his chapel experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told no one, not even her, of Kyan&rsquo;s confidential disclosure, and,
      after some speculation as to whether or not there might be a sequel, put
      the whole ludicrous affair out of his mind. He worked hard in his study
      and at his pastoral duties, and was conscious of a pleasant feeling that
      he was gaining his people&rsquo;s confidence and esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week from the following Sunday he dined in state at the Daniels&rsquo;s table.
      Captain Elkanah was gracious and condescending. Annabel was more than
      that. She was dressed in her newest gown and was so very gushing and
      affable that the minister felt rather embarrassed. When, after the meal
      was over, Captain Elkanah excused himself and went upstairs for his
      Sabbath nap, the embarrassment redoubled. Miss Annabel spoke very
      confidentially of her loneliness, without &ldquo;congenial society,&rdquo; of how VERY
      much she did enjoy Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s intellectual sermons, and especially what
      a treat it had been to have him as a guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must dine here every Sunday,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will be no trouble at
      all, and if you say no, I shall feel that it is because you don&rsquo;t want to
      see me&mdash;FATHER and me, of course, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister didn&rsquo;t accept this pressing invitation; on the other hand, he
      could not refuse it absolutely. He did not like Miss Daniels overmuch, but
      she was the daughter of his leading parishioner and she and her parent did
      seem to like him. So he dodged the issue and said she was very kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the big house as soon as he could without giving offense, and
      started back toward the parsonage. But the afternoon was so fine and the
      early summer air so delightful that he changed his mind and, jumping the
      fence at the foot of Cannon Hill, set off across the fields toward the
      bluffs and the bay shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was low in the west as he entered the grove of pines on the bluff.
      The red light between the boughs made brilliant carpet patterns on the
      thick pine needles and the smell was balsamy and sweet. Between the tree
      trunks he caught glimpses of the flats, now partially covered, and they
      reminded him of his narrow escape and of Nat Hammond, his rescuer. He had
      met the captain twice since then, once at the store and again on the main
      road, and had chatted with him. He liked him immensely and wished he might
      count him as an intimate friend. But intimacy between a Regular clergyman
      and the son of the leader of the Come-Outers was out of the question.
      Partisans on both sides would shriek at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking of the Hammond family reminded him of another member of it. Not
      that he needed to be reminded; he had thought of her often enough since
      she ran away from him in the rain that night. And the picture in the
      doorway was not one that he could forget&mdash;or wanted to. If she were
      not a Come-Outer, he could meet her occasionally and they might become
      friends. She was a disconcerting young person, who lacked proper respect
      for one of his profession and laughed when she shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;but she was
      interesting, he admitted that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw her. She was standing just at the outer edge of the grove,
      leaning against a tree and looking toward the sunset. She wore a simple
      white dress and her hat hung upon her shoulders by its ribbons. The rosy
      light edged the white gown with pink and the fringes of her dark hair were
      crinkly lines of fire. Her face was grave, almost sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery stood still, with one foot uplifted for a step. The girl
      looked out over the water and he looked at her. Then a crow, one of
      several whirling above the pines, spied the intruder and screamed a
      warning. The minister was startled and stepped back. A dead limb beneath
      his foot cracked sharply. Grace turned and saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery emerged from the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Miss Van Horne,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is&mdash;er&mdash;I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This statement was neither brilliant nor original; even as an
      identification it lacked considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; repeated the girl. &ldquo;Who? Oh! Why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Van Horne,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I frightened
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at him with a queer expression, almost as if she scarcely
      believed him real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo; he began again. She interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said confusedly, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t frighten me. I was a little
      startled when I saw you there behind me. It seemed so odd, because I was
      just thinking&mdash;No, I wasn&rsquo;t frightened. What is there to be
      frightened of&mdash;in Trumet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had extended his hand, but partially withdrew it, not sure how even
      such a perfunctory act of friendliness might be received. She saved him
      embarrassment by frankly offering her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; he said, in answer to her question. He would
      have liked to ask what she had been thinking that made his sudden
      appearance seem so odd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to see the sunset, I suppose?&rdquo; she said hurriedly, as if to head
      off a question. &ldquo;So did I. It is a beautiful evening for a walk, isn&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had said precisely the same thing on that other evening, when they
      stood in the middle of &ldquo;Hammond&rsquo;s Turn-off&rdquo; in the driving rain. He
      remembered it, and so, evidently, did she, for she colored slightly and
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it this time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t get cold from your
      wetting the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wasn&rsquo;t very wet. You wouldn&rsquo;t let me lend you the umbrella, so I
      had that to protect me on the way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not then; I meant the other morning when Nat&mdash;Cap&rsquo;n Hammond&mdash;met
      you out on the flats. He said you were wading the main channel and it was
      over your boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over my boots! Is that all he said? Over my head would be the plain
      truth. To cross it I should have had to swim and, if what I&rsquo;ve heard since
      is true, I doubt if I could swim that channel. Captain Hammond helped me
      out of a bad scrape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I guess not. He said you were cruising without a pilot and he
      towed you into port; that&rsquo;s the way he expressed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worse than that, a good deal worse. It might have been my last
      cruise. I&rsquo;m pretty certain that I owe the captain my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him uncomprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it. That part of the channel I proposed swimming was exactly
      where two men have been drowned, so people say. I&rsquo;m not a very strong
      swimmer, and they were. So, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace cried out in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Then pointing toward the bay, she asked: &ldquo;Out there,
      by the end of that leader, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew a long breath. Then, after a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Nat spoke as if it was all a joke,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt he did. From what I hear of your brother, he generally refers to
      his own plucky, capable actions as jokes. Other people call them something
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but continued to gaze at the half-submerged &ldquo;leader,&rdquo;
       with the pine bough tied at its landward end to mark the edge of deep
      water, and the tide foaming through its lath gratings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother&mdash;&rdquo; went on the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t my brother,&rdquo; she interrupted absently. &ldquo;I wish he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed as she uttered the last sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course he isn&rsquo;t your real brother; I forgot. But he must seem like
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rather doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be proud of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; There was nothing doubtful this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he saved me from drowning. I&rsquo;m almost certain of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to mean it. He looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said drily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather glad myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t mean it exactly that way. Of course I&rsquo;m glad you weren&rsquo;t
      drowned, but I&rsquo;m especially glad that&mdash;that one of our family saved
      you. Now you won&rsquo;t believe that Come-Outers are all bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never believed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you did,&rdquo; she affirmed stubbornly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard nothing good of
      us since you came here. Don&rsquo;t tell fibs, Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Does&mdash;well, does Cap&rsquo;n Daniels, or his daughter, say
      anything good of us? Be honest, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think&mdash;that is, I shouldn&rsquo;t call their opinions
      unprejudiced. And, Miss Van Horne, perhaps the prejudice isn&rsquo;t all on one
      side. What did your uncle say about Cap&rsquo;n Nat&rsquo;s meeting me the other day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Eben doesn&rsquo;t know. Nat didn&rsquo;t tell anyone but me. He doesn&rsquo;t boast.
      And uncle would be glad he helped you. As I told you before, Mr. Ellery,
      I&rsquo;m not ashamed of my uncle. He has been so good to me that I never can
      repay him, never! When my own father was drowned he took me in, a little
      orphan that would probably have been sent to a home, and no father could
      be kinder or more indulgent than he has been. Anything I asked for I got,
      and at last I learned not to ask for too much. No self-denial on his part
      was too great, if he could please me. When he needed money most he said
      nothing to me, but insisted that I should be educated. I didn&rsquo;t know until
      afterwards of the self-sacrifice my four years at the Middleboro Academy
      meant to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister had listened eagerly to this defense of the man whom he had
      been led to consider his arch enemy. It was given with spirit and the
      girl&rsquo;s head was uplifted and her eyes flashed as she spoke. Ellery&rsquo;s next
      remark was uttered without premeditation. Really, he was thinking aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you went away to school?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;That is why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;never done nothin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;be you&rsquo; and &lsquo;hain&rsquo;t
      neither.&rsquo; Yes, thank you, that&rsquo;s why. I don&rsquo;t wonder you were surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You misunderstand me,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, you did. Not precisely that, perhaps, but pretty near it. I
      suppose you expected me to speak like Josiah Badger or Kyan Pepper. I try
      not to. And I try not to say &lsquo;immejitly,&rsquo; too,&rdquo; she added, with a
      mischievous twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellery recognized the &ldquo;immejitly&rdquo; quotation and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard but one person say that,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;And he isn&rsquo;t a
      Come-Outer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t. Well, this lesson in English can&rsquo;t be very interesting to
      you, Mr. Ellery, and I must go. But I&rsquo;m very glad Nat helped you the other
      day and that you realize the sort of man he is. And I&rsquo;m glad I have had
      the opportunity to tell you more about Uncle Eben. I owe him so much that
      I ought to be glad&mdash;yes, glad and proud and happy, too, to gratify
      his least wish. I must! I know I must, no matter how I&mdash;What am I
      talking about? Yes, Mr. Ellery, I&rsquo;m glad if I have helped you to
      understand my uncle better and why I love and respect him. If you knew him
      as I do, you would respect him, too. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was going, but the minister had something to say. He stepped forward
      and walked beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute, please,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Miss Van Horne, I do understand. I do
      respect your uncle. We have a mutual friend, you and I, and through her I
      have come to understand many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mutual friend?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Oh! I know. Mrs. Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mrs. Coffin. She&rsquo;s a good woman and a wise one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear! Do you like her, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she told you about me&mdash;about uncle, I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why, she told me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to enumerate some of the things Keziah had told concerning the
      Hammond family. They were all good things, and he couldn&rsquo;t help seeing
      that the recital pleased her. So he went on to tell how his housekeeper
      had helped him, of her advice, of her many acts of kindness, of what he
      owed to her. The girl listened eagerly, asking questions, nodding
      confirmation, and, in her delight at hearing Keziah praised, quite
      forgetting her previous eagerness to end the interview. And, as he talked,
      he looked at her, at the red light on her hair, the shine of her eyes,
      like phosphorus in the curl of a wave at night, at her long lashes, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Van Horne, &ldquo;you were saying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister awoke with a guilty start. He realized that his sentence had
      broken off in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! why&mdash;er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I was saying that&mdash;that
      I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done without Mrs. Coffin. She&rsquo;s a
      treasure. Frankly, she is the only real friend I have found in Trumet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I feel the same way about her. She means so much to me. I love
      her more than anyone else in the world, except uncle, of course&mdash;and
      Nat. I miss her very much since&mdash;since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I came, you mean. I&rsquo;m sorry. I wish&mdash;I hate to think I am the
      cause which separates you two. It isn&rsquo;t my fault, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I object to having others choose my friends for me, people who,
      because of a fanatical prejudice, stand in the way of&mdash;If it wasn&rsquo;t
      for that, you might call and see Mrs. Coffin, just as you used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace shook her head. They had moved on to the bend of the bluff, beyond
      the fringe of pines, and were now standing at the very edge of the high
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, you would come,&rdquo; asserted the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. I should like to come. I miss my talks with Aunt
      Keziah more than you can imagine&mdash;now especially. But, somehow, what
      we want to do most seems to be what we mustn&rsquo;t, and what we don&rsquo;t like is
      our duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said this without looking at him, and the expression on her face was
      the same sad, grave one he had noticed when he first saw her standing
      alone by the pine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, of course. You know I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? If my company is objectionable I can go away when you come. If
      you dislike me I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t dislike you personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s impossible. Uncle respects and is fond of Aunt Keziah, but he
      wouldn&rsquo;t hear of my visiting the parsonage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think your uncle might be persuaded? I&rsquo;m sure he
      misunderstands me, just as I should him if it weren&rsquo;t for Mrs. Coffin&mdash;and
      what you&rsquo;ve said. Don&rsquo;t you think if I called on him and he knew me better
      it might help matters? I&rsquo;ll do it gladly. I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. He wouldn&rsquo;t listen. And think of your own congregation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound my congregation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Ellery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in amazement; then her lips began to curl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister turned very red and drew his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that exactly,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a child. I
      have the right to exercise a man&rsquo;s discretion. My parish committee must
      understand that. They shall! If I choose to see you&mdash;Look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was close to the overhanging edge of the bluff and the sod upon which
      she stood was bending beneath her feet. He sprang forward, caught her
      about the waist, and pulled her back. The sod broke and rattled down the
      sandy slope. She would have had a slight tumble, nothing worse, had she
      gone with it. There was no danger; and yet the minister was very white as
      he released her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, too, was pale for a moment, and then crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I&mdash;I must go. It is late. I didn&rsquo;t realize
      how late it was. I&mdash;I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, though he tried to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, speaking at random. &ldquo;Good afternoon.
      Good-by. I hope you will enjoy your walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have enjoyed it.&rdquo; His answer was unstudied but emphatic. She recognized
      the emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to see Mrs. Coffin?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. You know I can&rsquo;t. Good-by. The sunset is beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;I think the sunsets from this point are the finest I have
      ever seen. I come here every Sunday afternoon to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark was given merely to cover embarrassment, but it had an
      unexpected effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DO?&rdquo; cried the minister. The next moment he was alone. Grace Van
      Horne had vanished in the gloom of the pine thickets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange John Ellery who walked slowly back along the path, one
      that Keziah herself would not have recognized, to say nothing of Captain
      Elkanah and the parish committee. The dignified parson, with the dignified
      walk and calm, untroubled brow, was gone, and here was an absent-minded
      young fellow who stumbled blindly along, tripping over roots and dead
      limbs, and caring nothing, apparently, for the damage to his Sunday boots
      and trousers which might result from the stumbles. He saw nothing real,
      and heard nothing, not even the excited person who, hidden behind the
      bayberry bush, hailed him as he passed. It was not until this person
      rushed forth and seized him by the arm that he came back to the
      unimportant affairs of this material earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Why, Mr. Pepper!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Are you here? What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I here?&rdquo; panted Kyan. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I been here for the last twenty minutes
      waitin&rsquo; to get a chance at you? Ain&rsquo;t I been chasin&rsquo; you from Dan to
      Beersheby all this dummed&mdash;excuse me&mdash;afternoon? Oh, my godfreys
      mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Matter enough! It&rsquo;s all your fault. You got me into the mess, now
      you git me out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Usually, when Abishai addressed his clergyman, it was in a tone of humble
      respect far different from his present frantic assault. The Reverend John
      was astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What IS the trouble, Mr. Pepper?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Behave yourself, man.
      What IS it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you made me do it,&rdquo; gurgled Kyan. &ldquo;Yes, sir, &lsquo;twas you put me
      up to it. When you was at our house t&rsquo;other day, after Laviny locked me
      up, you told me the way to get square was to lock her up, too. And I done
      it! Yes, sir, I done it when she got back from meetin&rsquo; this noon. I run
      off and left her locked in. And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;he wailed, wringing his
      hands&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t dast to go home sence. WHAT&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH MISS DANIELS DETERMINES TO FIND OUT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The hysterical Mr. Pepper doubtless expected his clergyman to be almost as
      much upset as he was by the news of his action. But John Ellery was
      provokingly calm. As a matter of fact he scarcely grasped the purport of
      the little man&rsquo;s disjointed story. He had been wandering in dreamland, his
      head among the clouds, and the explosion of Keziah&rsquo;s bomb disturbed, but
      did not clear the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan was staggered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;YOU don&rsquo;t? Then who does, for the land
      sakes? Didn&rsquo;t you tell me to lock her up? Didn&rsquo;t I do it &lsquo;CAUSE you told
      me? Didn&rsquo;t&mdash;didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be on the verge of apoplexy. Also he had raised his voice to
      a yell. The minister seized him by the arm and shook him into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Wait a minute. Let me understand this thing.
      Some one is locked up, you say. Who is it? Where&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHO is it? Ain&rsquo;t I tellin&rsquo; you. It&rsquo;s Laviny. She went into that spare
      room where I was t&rsquo;other day and I slammed the spring lock to on her. Then
      I grabbed the key and run. That was afore three this afternoon; now it&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;most night and I ain&rsquo;t dast to go home. What&rsquo;ll she say when I let her
      out? I got to let her out, ain&rsquo;t I? She can&rsquo;t starve to death in there,
      can she? And YOU told me to do it! YOU did! Oh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apoplectic attack was once more imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it, Mr. Pepper,&rdquo; ordered Ellery. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember telling you to
      lock your sister up, though&mdash;Why, yes, I may have said something or
      other, as a joke, but I didn&rsquo;t expect you would seriously consider doing
      such a thing. Ha, ha! This is the most idiotic piece of business that I
      ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be you laughin&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded the shocked Abishai. &ldquo;LAUGHIN&rsquo;? Why, my
      godfreys mighty! Idiotic? Well, who&rsquo;s the idiot? &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t me! I&rsquo;D never
      have thought of such a fool trick. But you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Let me think. Have you told anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TOLD anybody! I guess NOT. And nobody&rsquo;ll never know if they wait for me
      to tell &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I don&rsquo;t see why you can&rsquo;t go home and&mdash;hum&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      like to advise your telling a lie, but you might let her infer that it was
      an accident. OR, if you really mean to be your own master, you can tell
      her you did it purposely and will do it again if she ever tries the trick
      on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell her that! I tell her! O Mr. Ellery, DON&rsquo;T talk so. You don&rsquo;t know
      Laviny; she ain&rsquo;t like most women. If I should tell her that she&rsquo;d&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s she wouldn&rsquo;t take and horsewhip me. Or commit suicide. She&rsquo;s
      said she would afore now if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! She won&rsquo;t do that, you needn&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; He burst into another
      laugh, but checked himself, as he saw the look of absolute distress on
      poor Kyan&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Mr. Pepper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll think of some plan to smooth
      matters over. I&rsquo;ll go home with you now and we&rsquo;ll let her out together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, Mr. Ellery? Will you, honest? Say, by godfreys mighty, I&rsquo;d get
      down on my knees and thank you this minute if&mdash;if I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t in such a
      hurry. Come right on; come quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a silent procession of two that wended its way out of the pines and
      across the fields, by the brook and the pond, where the evening mists were
      rising and the frogs chanting their good-night song, through the gathering
      twilight shades, across the main road and up the lighthouse lane. Kyan,
      his mind filled with fearful forebodings, was busily trying to think of a
      reasonable excuse for the &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; imprisonment of his sister. John
      Ellery was thinking, also, but his thoughts were not of the Peppers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little house was dark and still as they approached it. No welcoming
      light in the dining-room windows, no open door, no shrill voice demanding
      to know where the wandering brother had been &ldquo;all this everlastin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
       Even the hens had gone to roost. Abishai groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scart to death. Where is she? You don&rsquo;t
      cal&rsquo;late she&rsquo;s done it, do ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done it? Done what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done the suicidin&rsquo;. She said she would if&mdash;O Laviny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Be quiet. She&rsquo;s all right. She&rsquo;s in the room where you left her, of
      course. She couldn&rsquo;t get out, could she? You&rsquo;ve got the key. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the house. The dining room was dark and quiet. So was the
      sitting room. The clock ticked, solemn and slow. Kyan clutched at his
      companion&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear her,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose she HAS done it?
      Godfreys mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gloom and mystery were having their effect, even on Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s
      nerves. His answer also was given in a tense whisper, but with some
      irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Let go of my wrist. You&rsquo;ve pinched it black and
      blue. Which room did you leave her in? Show me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan&rsquo;s trembling knees managed to carry him to the little hall leading
      from the sitting room toward the ell at the side of the house. This hall
      was almost pitch black. The minister felt his guide&rsquo;s chin whisker brush
      his ear as the following sentence was literally breathed into it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;here &lsquo;tis,&rdquo; panted Kyan. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the door. I don&rsquo;t hear
      nothin&rsquo;, do you? Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened. Not a sound, save the dismal tick of the clock in the room
      they had left. Ellery knocked on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pepper,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Miss Pepper, are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan caught his breath. No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pepper,&rdquo; repeated the minister. &ldquo;Miss Pepper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence, absolute. Abishai could stand it no longer. He groaned and
      collapsed on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has!&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s done it and there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in there but
      her remains. Oh, my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery, now rather frightened himself, shook him violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, you idiot!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;We must go in. Give me the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After repeated orders and accompanying shakings, Kyan produced a key. The
      minister snatched it from his trembling fingers, felt for the keyhole and
      threw the door open. The little room was almost as dark as the hall and
      quite as still. There was a distinct smell of old clothes and camphor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A match,&rdquo; demanded Ellery. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got none,&rdquo; quavered Mr. Pepper. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in the box in the
      settin&rsquo; room. Oh, my godfreys mighty! What&rsquo;ll I do? What undertaker&rsquo;ll I
      have? Solon Tripp&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar one, but Laviny and he had a row and she
      said she&rsquo;d come back and ha&rsquo;nt me if I ever let him touch her rema&mdash;Where
      you goin&rsquo;? DON&rsquo;T LEAVE ME HERE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister was going after a match, and said so. In a moment he returned
      with several. One of these he lit. The brimstone sputtered, burned blue
      and fragrant, then burst into a yellow flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery drew a breath of relief. Then he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GONE? Why, she ain&rsquo;t nuther! Where could she go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but she has gone&mdash;somewhere. At any rate, she&rsquo;s not
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan rose to his feet. His alarm had changed to paralyzed astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could she go?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;That window won&rsquo;t open more&rsquo;n six
      inches. Laviny ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call fleshy, but she never could squeeze
      through that in this world. And I locked the door, &lsquo;cause I heard the
      click. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;do you b&rsquo;lieve in spirits, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Come into the sitting room, light a lamp, and let&rsquo;s talk it
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lamp was found and lighted at last. Its radiance brightened the dingy
      sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you b&rsquo;lieve in spirits?&rdquo; repeated Kyan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard yarns about folks
      bein&rsquo; spirited away, but I never took much stock in &lsquo;em. And,&rdquo; he added
      with conviction, &ldquo;&lsquo;twould take a pretty husky spirit to handle Laviny if
      she had her mad up. She&mdash;Hush! hear that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound of wheels was heard in the lane by the front gate. A vehicle
      stopped. Then some one called a hurried good night. Mr. Pepper&rsquo;s fear
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been ahuntin&rsquo; for me. NOW I&rsquo;ll get it! You
      stand by me, Mr. Ellery. You got to. You said you would. But how on earth
      did she get&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister motioned him to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand by you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak. Leave it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A step sounded on the back step. The dining-room door was hurriedly thrown
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bishy,&rdquo; called Miss Pepper eagerly. &ldquo;&lsquo;Bish, where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;here I be, Laviny,&rdquo; faltered Kyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister appeared on the threshold. She was dressed in her Sunday best,
      flowered poke bonnet, mitts, imitation India shawl, rustling black
      bombazine gown. She looked at Mr. Pepper then at the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;be you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend John admitted his presence. Miss Pepper&rsquo;s demeanor surprised
      him. She did not seem angry; indeed, she acted embarrassed and confused,
      as if she, and not her brother, were the guilty party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m awful late, &lsquo;Bishy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you had your supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan was too perturbed to venture a reply. The sword above his head was
      quivering on its single hair and he was preparing to dodge the fall. But
      it did not fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had any supper, have you?&rdquo; purred Miss Pepper pityingly.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad. You poor thing! you must be awful hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved across the room and kissed him. Abishai, who had prepared
      himself for a different sort of greeting, clutched his chair with both
      hands. He looked as if he might faint. The minister gazed open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful sorry, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; gushed Lavinia, removing the bonnet. &ldquo;You
      see, I was invited out to ride this afternoon and&mdash;and&mdash;I went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at her brother, reddened&mdash;yes, almost blushed&mdash;and
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, &lsquo;Bishy,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;Thankful Payne&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s home avisitin&rsquo; 
      her. He come about that cousin&rsquo;s will&mdash;the other cousin that&rsquo;s just
      died. He&rsquo;s a reel nice man&mdash;her live cousin is&mdash;keeps a shoe
      store up to Sandwich, and I used to know him years ago. When I was over to
      Thankful&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other day, him and me had quite a talk. We got speakin&rsquo; of
      what nice drives there was around Trumet and&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;well,
      he asked me if I wouldn&rsquo;t like to go to ride next Sunday afternoon&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      to-day. And a ride bein&rsquo; a good deal of a treat to me, I said I would.
      Thankful was goin&rsquo;, too, but&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t very
      well. So Caleb&mdash;that&rsquo;s his name, you remember, &lsquo;Bishy&mdash;he come
      round with his horse and team about ha&rsquo;f past three and we started. But
      I&rsquo;d no IDEE &lsquo;twas so late. I&mdash;I&mdash;meant to tell you I was goin&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;Bish, but I forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan had listened to this recital, or explanation, or apology, with a
      curious succession of expressions passing over his face. He swallowed two
      or three times, but did not interrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry I kept you waitin&rsquo; supper,&rdquo; gushed Lavinia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a
      good one now. Oh, well, deary me! I must be gettin&rsquo; absent-minded. I ain&rsquo;t
      asked you where you&rsquo;ve been all the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abishai&rsquo;s eyes turned beseechingly toward his promised backer. Ellery
      could not resist that mute appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother has been with me for some time, Miss Pepper,&rdquo; he
      volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, has he? Ain&rsquo;t that nice! He couldn&rsquo;t have been in better comp&rsquo;ny, I&rsquo;m
      sure. But oh, say, &lsquo;Bishy! I ain&rsquo;t told you how nigh I come to not gettin&rsquo; 
      out at all. Just afore Mr. Payne come, I was in that spare room and&mdash;you
      remember I put a spring lock on that door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was here at last. The long-dreaded explosion was imminent. Kyan&rsquo;s chin
      shook. He braced himself for the blow. The minister prepared to come to
      the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Lavinia. &ldquo;I&mdash;I put a lock on that door so&rsquo;s I&mdash;I
      could shut the room up when I wanted to. Well, when I was in there this
      afternoon the wind blew the door shut and&mdash;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never said nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; panted Kyan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it blew to, the lock clicked, and there I was. If I hadn&rsquo;t had the
      other key in my pocket I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I wouldn&rsquo;t have been in there yet.
      That would have been a pretty mess, wouldn&rsquo;t it! He! he! he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed shrilly. The minister looked at her, then at her brother, and
      he, too, burst into a shout of laughter. Kyan did not laugh; yet his grip
      upon the chair relaxed, and over his countenance was spreading a look of
      relief, of hope and peace, like a clear sunrise after a stormy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must go and get supper,&rdquo; declared Lavinia. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll forgive me for
      leavin&rsquo; you so, won&rsquo;t you, &lsquo;Bishy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive you, Laviny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would. I hope you ain&rsquo;t been too lonesome. Did you miss me?
      Was you worried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? Yes, I&mdash;I missed you consider&rsquo;ble. I WAS gettin&rsquo; sort of
      worried. I didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;d go off to ride with&mdash;with a feller and
      leave me all alone. But I forgive you.&rdquo; He stopped, drew his hand across
      his forehead, and then added, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I hadn&rsquo;t ought to complain. Maybe
      I&rsquo;d better get used to it; I guess likely this is only the beginnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia blushed furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, &lsquo;Bish!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How you do talk! Ain&rsquo;t he awful, Mr.
      Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend John did not answer. He could not trust himself to speak just
      then. When he did it was to announce that he must be getting toward home.
      No, he couldn&rsquo;t stay for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pepper went into the kitchen, and Abishai saw the visitor to the
      door. Ellery extended his hand and Kyan shook it with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Talk about your miracles! Godfreys
      mighty! Say, Mr. Ellery, don&rsquo;t you ever tell a soul how it really was,
      will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know you won&rsquo;t. You won&rsquo;t tell on me and I won&rsquo;t tell on you.
      That&rsquo;s a trade, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister stopped in the middle of his step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said, turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper merely smiled, winked, and shut the door. John Ellery reflected
      much during his homeward walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer in Trumet drowsed on, as Trumet summers did in those days, when
      there were no boarders from the city, no automobiles or telephones or
      &ldquo;antique&rdquo; collectors. In June the Sunday school had its annual picnic. On
      the morning of the Fourth of July some desperate spirits among the younger
      set climbed in at the church window and rang the bell, in spite of the
      warning threats of the selectmen, who had gone on record as prepared to
      prosecute all disturbers of the peace to the &ldquo;full extent of the law.&rdquo; One
      of the leading citizens, his name was Daniels, awoke to find the sleigh,
      which had been stored in his carriage house, hoisted to the roof of his
      barn, and a section of his front fence tastefully draped about it like a
      garland. The widow Rogers noticed groups of people looking up at her house
      and laughing. Coming out to see what they were laughing at, she was
      provoked beyond measure to find a sign over the front door, announcing
      &ldquo;Man Wanted Imediate. Inquire Within.&rdquo; The door of the Come-Outer chapel
      was nailed fast and Captain Zeb Mayo&rsquo;s old white horse wandered loose
      along the main road ringed with painted black stripes like a zebra.
      Captain Zeb was an angry man, for he venerated that horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm caused by these outbreaks subsided and Trumet settled into its
      jog trot. The stages rattled through daily, the packet came and went every
      little while, occasionally a captain returned home from a long voyage, and
      another left for one equally long. Old Mrs. Prince, up at the west end of
      the town, was very anxious concerning her son, whose ship was overdue at
      Calcutta and had not been heard from. The minister went often to see her
      and tried to console, but what consolation is there when one&rsquo;s only child
      and sole support is nobody knows where, drowned and dead perhaps, perhaps
      a castaway on a desert island, or adrift with a desperate crew in an open
      boat? And Mrs. Prince would say, over and over again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mr. Ellery. Thank you. I&rsquo;m sure you mean to encourage me, but
      oh, you don&rsquo;t know the things that happen to seafarin&rsquo; men. I do. I went
      to sea with my husband for fourteen year. He died on a voyage and they
      buried him over the vessel&rsquo;s side. I can&rsquo;t even go to his grave. The sea
      got him, and now if it&rsquo;s taken my Eddie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young clergyman came away from these calls feeling very young, indeed,
      and woefully inadequate. What DID he know of the great sorrows of life?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday dinners with the Daniels family were almost regular weekly
      functions now. He dodged them when he could, but he could not do so often
      without telling an absolute lie, and this he would not do. And, regularly,
      when the solemn meal was eaten, Captain Elkanah went upstairs for his nap
      and the Reverend John was left alone with Annabel. Miss Daniels did her
      best to be entertaining, was, in fact, embarrassingly confidential and
      cordial. It was hard work to get away, and yet, somehow or other, at the
      stroke of four, the minister always said good-by and took his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your hurry, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo; begged Annabel on one occasion when the
      reading of Moore&rsquo;s poems had been interrupted in the middle by the guest&rsquo;s
      sudden rising and reaching for his hat. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you always go so
      early. It&rsquo;s so every time you&rsquo;re here. Do you call at any other house on
      Sunday afternoons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why can&rsquo;t you stay? You know I&mdash;that is, pa and I&mdash;would
      LOVE to have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Thank you. You&rsquo;re very kind. But I really must go. Good
      afternoon, Miss Daniels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Rogers said she saw you going across the fields after you left here
      last Sunday. Did you go for a walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had mentioned it. I love to walk, and there are SO few people
      that I find congenial company. Are you going for a walk now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&mdash;er&mdash;not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. GOOD-by. Will you come again next Sunday? Of COURSE you will.
      You know how dreadfully disappointed I&mdash;we&mdash;shall be if you
      don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Daniels. I enjoyed the dinner very much. Good afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried down the path. Annabel watched him go. Then she did an odd
      thing. She passed through the sitting room, entered the front hall, went
      up the stairs, tiptoed by the door of her father&rsquo;s room, and then up
      another flight to the attic. From here a steep set of steps led to the
      cupola on the roof. In that cupola was a spyglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel opened a window a few inches, took the spyglass from its rack,
      adjusted it, laid it on the sill of the open window and knelt, the glass
      at her eye. The floor of the cupola was very dusty and she was wearing her
      newest and best gown, but she did not seem to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the glass she saw the long slope of Cannon Hill, with the beacon
      at the top and Captain Mayo&rsquo;s house near it. The main road was deserted
      save for one figure, that of her late caller. He was mounting the hill in
      long strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched him gain the crest and pass over it out of sight. Then she
      shifted the glass so that it pointed toward the spot beyond the curve of
      the hill, where the top of a thick group of silver-leafs hid the
      parsonage. Above the tree tops glistened the white steeple of the Regular
      church. If the minister went straight home she could not see him. But
      under those silver-leafs was the beginning of the short cut across the
      fields where Didama had seen Mr. Ellery walking on the previous Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Annabel watched and waited. Five minutes, then ten. He must have
      reached the clump of trees before this, yet she could not see him.
      Evidently, he had gone straight home. She drew a breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, being in a happier frame of mind, and the afternoon clear and
      beautiful, she moved the glass along the horizon, watching the distant
      white specks across the bay on the Wellmouth bluffs&mdash;houses and
      buildings they were&mdash;the water, the shore, the fish weirs, the pine
      groves. She became interested in a sloop, beating into Wellmouth harbor,
      and watched that. After a time she heard, in the house below, her father
      shouting her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave the glass one more comprehensive sweep preparatory to closing it
      and going downstairs. As she did this a moving speck came into view and
      vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly she moved the big end of the spyglass back along the arc it had
      traveled. She found the speck and watched it. It was a man, striding
      across the meadow land, a half mile beyond the parsonage, and hurrying in
      the direction of the beach. She saw him climb a high dune, jump a fence,
      cross another field and finally vanish in the grove of pines on the edge
      of the bluff by the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was John Ellery, the minister. Evidently, he had not gone home,
      nor had he taken the short cut. Instead he had walked downtown a long way
      and THEN turned in to cross the fields and work his way back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel put down the glass and, heedless of her father&rsquo;s calls, sat
      thinking. The minister had deliberately deceived her. More than that, he
      had gone to considerable trouble to avoid observation. Why had he done it?
      Had he done the same thing on other Sunday afternoons? Was there any real
      reason why he insisted on leaving the house regularly at four o&rsquo;clock?
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel did not know. Her eyes snapped and her sharp features looked
      sharper yet as she descended the steps to the attic. She did not know; but
      she intended to find out.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH&rsquo;S TROUBLES MULTIPLY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Keziah was getting worried about her parson. Not concerning his popularity
      with his congregation. She had long since ceased to worry about that. The
      young minister&rsquo;s place in his people&rsquo;s regard was now assured, the
      attendance was increasing, and the Regular church was now on a firmer
      footing, financially and socially, than it had been in years. Even Mrs.
      Rogers and Lavinia Pepper had ceased to criticise, except as pertained to
      unimportant incidentals, and were now among the loudest of the praise
      chanters. And as Captain Zeb Mayo said: &ldquo;When Didama and Laviny stops
      fault-findin&rsquo;, the millennium&rsquo;s so nigh port a feller ought to be
      overhaulin&rsquo; his saint uniform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what worried Mrs. Coffin was John Ellery&rsquo;s personal appearance and
      behavior. He had grown perceptibly thinner during the past month, his
      manner was distrait, and, worst of all in the housekeeper&rsquo;s eyes, his
      appetite had fallen off. She tried all sorts of tempting dishes, but the
      result was discouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want but one piece of huckleberry pie? Why,
      a week ago you ate three and looked kind of disappointed &lsquo;cause the dish
      was empty. What is the matter? Are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; replied the Reverend John. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not sick. I just
      don&rsquo;t feel hungry, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Well, I&rsquo;ve usually noticed that when a healthy man don&rsquo;t feel hungry
      at dinner time, &lsquo;specially in the huckleberry season, his healthiness is
      pretty shaky. What does ail you, Mr. Ellery? Got somethin&rsquo; on your mind?
      If you have, I&rsquo;d heave it overboard. Or you might unload it onto me and
      let me prescribe. I&rsquo;ve had consider&rsquo;ble experience in that kind of
      doctorin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the answer was unsatisfactory. Mr. Ellery laughed, changed the
      subject, and wandered out into the garden, where Keziah saw him, shortly
      afterwards, intently regarding nothing in particular with a rapt stare.
      She watched him for a few moments and then, with a puzzled shake of the
      head, returned to her work. She believed that he was troubled about
      something and was herself troubled in consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His absent-mindedness was most acute on Sunday evenings, before prayer
      meeting, and after he had returned from the afternoon at Captain
      Elkanah&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she said, on one of these Sunday evenings, &ldquo;do you
      know, it seems to me that Elkanah&rsquo;s meals must go to your head. Don&rsquo;t have
      any of his granddad&rsquo;s New England rum, do you? They tell me he&rsquo;s got some
      of that down cellar that he doles out occasional to his very particular
      friends. That&rsquo;s the common yarn around town, though I couldn&rsquo;t swear &lsquo;twas
      gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister smiled and denied acquaintanceship with the New England
      beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Then it must be the other thing. You ain&rsquo;t in love, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man started, colored, and was plainly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;In love, Mrs. Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in love. Annabel hasn&rsquo;t landed a male at last, has she? She&rsquo;s a line
      over the side for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hearty laugh with which this was received settled the question of
      Annabel&rsquo;s success. Keziah was relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any grudge against
      Annabel, but neither have I got one against you. Another man in that
      family would have an easy time in one way, he wouldn&rsquo;t have to do any
      thinkin&rsquo; for himself&mdash;Elkanah and his daughter would do all that was
      necessary. So you&rsquo;re not in love. Then I don&rsquo;t know what does ail you.
      I&rsquo;ll say this, though, for a body that ain&rsquo;t in love you certainly stay
      with the Danielses a long time. You went there right after meetin&rsquo; this
      noon and now it&rsquo;s seven o&rsquo;clock and you&rsquo;ve just got home. And &lsquo;twas the
      same last Sunday and the one before. Been there all the time, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew he had not, because she had seen him pass the parsonage, on the
      opposite side of the road, two hours before. But she was curious to learn
      what his reply would be. It was noncommittal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Not all the time. I&mdash;er&mdash;went for a short
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could inquire concerning that walk he had entered the study and
      closed the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the week which followed this particular conversation he was more
      absent-minded than ever. There were evenings when he spoke scarcely a
      word, but sat silent in his chair, while Keziah, looking up from her
      mending, watched him and guessed and wondered. After he had gone to his
      room for the night, she would hear him pacing the floor, back and forth,
      back and forth. She asked no more questions, however; minding her own
      business was a specialty of Keziah&rsquo;s, and it was a rare quality in Trumet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday was a cloudy, warm day, &ldquo;muggy,&rdquo; so Captain Zeb described it. After
      the morning service Mr. Ellery, as usual, went home with Captain Daniels
      and Annabel. Keziah returned to the parsonage, ate a lonely dinner, washed
      the dishes, and sat down to read a library book. She read for an hour and
      then, finding it difficult to keep her mind on the story, gave it up,
      closed the book and, rising, walked to the window. But the misty, hot
      loneliness of the afternoon, was neither interesting nor cheerful, so she
      turned away and went upstairs to her own room. Her trunk was in one corner
      of this room and she unlocked it, taking from a compartment of the tray a
      rosewood writing case, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, a present from her
      father, who had brought it home from sea when she was a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the case she took a packet of letters and a daguerreotype. The latter
      was the portrait of a young man, in high-collared coat, stock, and fancy
      waistcoat. His hair, worn long over the ears, was smooth with a shine that
      suggested oil, and in his shirt front was a large pin, which might
      possibly have been mistaken by a credulous observer for a diamond. Mrs.
      Coffin looked at the daguerreotype, sighed, shuddered, and laid it aside.
      Then she opened the packet of letters. Selecting one from the top of the
      pile, she read it slowly. And, as she read, she sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not hear the back door of the parsonage open and close softly. Nor
      did she hear the cautious footsteps in the rooms below. What aroused her
      from her reading was her own name, spoken at the foot of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah! Keziah, are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started, sprang up, and ran out into the hall, the letter still in her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked sharply. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, is that you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Nat. Are you busy, Keziah? I want to
      see you for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper hurriedly thrust the letter into her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right down, Nat,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in the sitting room when she entered. He was wearing his Sunday
      suit of blue and his soft felt hat was on the center table. She held out
      her hand and he shook it heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she observed, smiling, &ldquo;I declare if I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve got
      the tiptoe habit. This is the second time you&rsquo;ve sneaked into the house
      and scared me &lsquo;most to death. I asked you before if you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ashamed of
      yourself and now I ask it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply she caught a glimpse of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What is the matter? Is anybody sick? Is your
      father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s all right. That is, he&rsquo;s as well as he has been lately, though
      that isn&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Grace&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s all right, too, I guess. Been sort of quiet and sorrowful for
      the last few weeks&mdash;or I&rsquo;ve seemed to notice that she has&mdash;but I
      cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; serious. I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if the same thing that&rsquo;s
      troublin&rsquo; her is what ails me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell you, Keziah. That&rsquo;s what I come here for. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, can&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t stand up there like a lighthouse, shuttin&rsquo; out
      the whole broadside of the room. You are the BIGGEST thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hammond selected the most substantial chair in the apartment and
      sat down upon it. He looked at his friend and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, Keziah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I was as deep down in the blues as the
      bottom of the Whale Deep, a look at that face of yours would pull me to
      the top again. You&rsquo;re a good woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks! When I have spare time on my hands I&rsquo;ll practice tryin&rsquo; to
      believe that. But what is the trouble, Nat? Out with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Keziah, it&rsquo;s trouble enough. Dad and I have had a fallin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s mouth and eyes opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she cried, in utter astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s true. We had what was next door to a real quarrel after dinner
      to-day. It would have been a real one if I hadn&rsquo;t walked off and left him.
      He&rsquo;s as set as the rock of Gibraltar, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your foundations ain&rsquo;t given to slippin&rsquo; much. Nat Hammond, I&rsquo;m
      surprised at you! What was it all about? Religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not a sliver of religion in it. If &lsquo;twas that, I could dodge, or haul
      down my colors, if I had to. But it&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; worse, enough sight worse.
      Somethin&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t do&mdash;even for dad&mdash;and won&rsquo;t either. Keziah,
      he&rsquo;s dead set on my marryin&rsquo; Grace. Says if I don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll know that I
      don&rsquo;t really care a tin nickel for him, or for his wishes, or what becomes
      of the girl after he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact. You see, dad realizes, better&rsquo;n I thought he did, that his
      health is pretty shaky and that he is likely to founder &lsquo;most any time. He
      says that don&rsquo;t worry him; if he knew Grace and I were provided for he&rsquo;d
      slip his cable with a clean manifest. But the dream of his life, he says,
      has been that we should marry. And he wants to see it done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was silent for a moment. Then she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Grace herself? How does she feel about it? Has he spoken to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I guess likely he has. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s been so
      sort of mournful lately. But never mind whether he has or not; I won&rsquo;t do
      it and I told him so. He got red hot in a jiffy. I was ungrateful and
      stubborn and all sorts of things. And I, bein&rsquo; a Hammond, with some of the
      Hammond balkiness in me, I set my foot down as hard as his. And we had it
      until&mdash;until&mdash;well, until I saw him stagger and tremble so that
      I actually got scared and feared he was goin&rsquo; to keel over where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; he kept sayin&rsquo;. &lsquo;But WHY can&rsquo;t you? Ain&rsquo;t she a girl
      anyone would be proud to have for a wife?&rsquo; &lsquo;Course there was no answer to
      that but yes. Then back he comes again with &lsquo;Then why can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; At last,
      bein&rsquo; frightened, as I said, that he might have another shock or
      somethin&rsquo;, I said I&rsquo;d think it over and come away and left him. And I come
      straight to you. Keziah, what shall I do? What can you say to help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was silent. She was looking, not at her companion, but at the
      carpet center of one of the braided rugs on the floor. Her face was very
      grave and the lines about her mouth seemed to deepen. Her hands, clasped
      in her lap, tightened one upon the other. But her voice was calm when, at
      last, she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only one thing I can say. And that&rsquo;s what your
      father said: Why can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain sprang from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he cried incredulously. &ldquo;What are you sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what your father said, Nat. Why can&rsquo;t you marry Grace? She&rsquo;s a dear,
      good girl and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be&mdash;keelhauled! Keziah Coffin, you sit there and ask me why I
      can&rsquo;t marry her! YOU do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah, you&rsquo;re crazy! Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that. We&rsquo;re not jokin&rsquo; now.
      You know why I can&rsquo;t marry her, nor anyone else in this round world but
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat, I can&rsquo;t marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know. You&rsquo;re always sayin&rsquo; that. But you don&rsquo;t mean it. You
      can&rsquo;t mean it. Why, you and me have been picked out for each other by the
      Almighty, Keziah. I swear I believe just that. We went together when we
      were boy and girl, to parties and such. We was promised when I first went
      to sea. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that fool row we had&mdash;and &lsquo;twas all my
      fault and I know it&mdash;you never would have let that da&mdash;that
      miserable Anse Coffin come near you. And when &lsquo;twas too late and you&rsquo;d
      married him, the mean, drunken, cruel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Nat! hush! Stop it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was, and you know he was. Yes, and worse besides. Runnin&rsquo; off and
      leavin&rsquo; a wife like you to&mdash;Oh, my God! when I think I might have
      been your husband to look out for you and take care of you! That you might
      have been with me on board my ships. That, when I come down the companion
      on stormy nights I might have found you there to comfort me and&mdash;O
      Keziah! we aren&rsquo;t young any more. What&rsquo;s the use of foolin&rsquo;? I want you.
      I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to have you. Coffin is dead these ten years. When I heard he was
      drowned off there in Singapore, all I could say was: &lsquo;Serve him right!&rsquo; 
      And I say it now. I come home then more determined to get you. Say yes,
      and let&rsquo;s be happy. Do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? For Heaven sakes! why not? Don&rsquo;t you care for me? You&rsquo;ve let me
      think&mdash;well, at any rate, I have thought you did. You used to. Don&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat, I&mdash;I care for you more than anybody else on earth. But I can&rsquo;t
      marry you. Oh, don&rsquo;t keep askin&rsquo; it! Please don&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t marry you, Nat.
      No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not now, maybe. Not this month, or even this year, perhaps, but
      some day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Nat. You must listen. There&rsquo;s no use of this goin&rsquo; on any longer. I
      mean it. I can&rsquo;t marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you wish to think so. Then I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But by and by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not by and by. Never, Nat. Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he repeated, more to himself than to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. Yes, Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by the everlastin&rsquo;! I&rsquo;ll do somethin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you won&rsquo;t. Nat Hammond, I know you. You&rsquo;re a great big,
      brave-hearted, sensible man. You won&rsquo;t be foolish. You&rsquo;ll do&mdash;yes, I
      think you&rsquo;d better do just what your father asks you to do. Marry Grace,
      if she wants you and will have you. She&rsquo;ll make you a good wife; you&rsquo;ll
      learn to care for her, and I know she&rsquo;ll have the best husband that a girl
      could hope for. And you and I will be friends, just as we&rsquo;ve always been,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah, stop that! Stop it, do you hear! I don&rsquo;t want to listen to such
      stuff. I tell you I&rsquo;m past soft soap, and I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d give it to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, &lsquo;Nat&rsquo;! A lot you care for &lsquo;Nat&rsquo;! Not a reason on God&rsquo;s footstool
      why you won&rsquo;t have me&mdash;except one, and that one that you don&rsquo;t want
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Nat! I can hardly believe this is you. This trouble with your
      father has upset you. You don&rsquo;t mean what you say. You&rsquo;re not talkin&rsquo; like
      yourself and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it, I tell you. I don&rsquo;t feel like myself. I banked on you, Keziah.
      I&rsquo;ve lived for you. And now&mdash;O Keziah, take it back! Give me a little
      hope, just enough to keep my head above water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, Nat. I only wish I could. But &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be any use. I can&rsquo;t
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched his hat from the table and strode to the door. Turning, he
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said chokingly. &ldquo;All right. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His steps sounded on the oilcloth of the kitchen. Then the back door
      slammed. He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah started, as if the slam of the door had been an electric shock.
      During the interview she had been pale and grave but outwardly calm. Now
      she sank wearily down in the chair from which she had risen and her head
      dropped forward upon her arms on the table. The letter she had been
      reading before Captain Nat&rsquo;s arrival fell from her waist to the floor and
      lay there, its badly spelled and blotted lines showing black and fateful
      against the white paper. And she cried, tears of utter loneliness and
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds thickened as the afternoon passed. The setting sun was hidden
      behind them; over the horizon of ocean and bay the fog banks were rolling
      in tumbled, crumpled masses. The shadows in the lonely sitting room
      deepened. There came a knock at the dining-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah sprang from her chair, smoothed her hair, hastily wiped her eyes,
      picked up the dropped letter and went to admit the visitor, whoever he or
      she might be. She was glad of the shadows, they prevented her face from
      being seen too plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; she said, opening the door. &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Abishai Pepper, standing on the stone step, and shifting
      uneasily from one foot to the other. &ldquo;Yes, Keziah, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s me,
      thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. Well, is Laviny with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o, she ain&rsquo;t. She&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Did she know you was comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o, I don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Well, what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s welcome was not too cordial. She had laughed many times over
      Abishai&rsquo;s proposal of marriage, but she had never quite forgiven him for
      making her ridiculous on that occasion. Incidentally, she did not feel
      like laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kyan was plainly nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to see Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Keziah.
      You needn&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! What on earth should I be afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I didn&rsquo;t know but you might be afraid I was goin&rsquo; to&mdash;to
      talk about what we talked about when I&mdash;I talked to you that day up
      at&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;ll do. It ain&rsquo;t me that would have reason to be afraid if
      THAT was what you come for. What do you want? Don&rsquo;t stand there dancin&rsquo; a
      jig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to see Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t keep him but a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out, I tell you. Do you want to leave a message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o. No, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it important?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know. Kind of, maybe. I wanted to ask his advice about
      somethin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a secret. Only him and me know about it. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell him you&rsquo;ll call again? Or ask him to come up to your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper, who had started to go, now hurried back to the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he protested, in alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell him that. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have him come there for no money. Why, Laviny, she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Laviny isn&rsquo;t in the secret, then?&rdquo; Keziah smiled in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. That is, not much. Don&rsquo;t you tell her I come here, will you?
      I&rsquo;ll find Mr. Ellery. I know where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go to the Danielses&rsquo;, if I was you. Elkanah might not like to
      have you chasin&rsquo; after his visitors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the minister ain&rsquo;t at the Danielses&rsquo;, not as late&rsquo;s this, he ain&rsquo;t. I
      know where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do?&rdquo; The housekeeper looked at him keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I do. I know where he goes Sunday afternoons&mdash;and why he
      goes, too. Mr. Ellery and me&rsquo;s good friends. We understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Kyan Pepper! What are you talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;. Good day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! Stand still! Come in the house here. I want you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Keziah. Really, I&rsquo;d love to, but I can&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, but lacking the strength of mind to refuse, Mr. Pepper
      entered the dining room. Then Mrs. Coffin turned upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;by throwin&rsquo; out hints that the minister
      and you are in some sort of secret? How dare you go round tellin&rsquo; people
      such yarns as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t yarns. And I never told nobody afore, anyhow. I got to move
      along. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are. I guess I&rsquo;ll run right up and ask your sister about
      this. Perhaps she might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ss-sh! ss-sh! don&rsquo;t talk that way, Keziah. Don&rsquo;t! Laviny don&rsquo;t know what
      I mean. Don&rsquo;t go askin&rsquo; HER things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just said I knew where Mr. Ellery goes every Sunday afternoon. He don&rsquo;t
      know anybody knows, but I do. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. I shan&rsquo;t tell. So&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell? Do you mean there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; Mr. Ellery wouldn&rsquo;t want told? Don&rsquo;t
      you dare&mdash;I WILL see Laviny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, no! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; much. I just know where he goes after he
      leaves Elkanah&rsquo;s and who he goes to meet. I&mdash;Lordy! I hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      said that! I&mdash;Keziah Coffin, don&rsquo;t you ever tell I told you. I&rsquo;ve
      said more&rsquo;n I meant to. If it comes out there&rsquo;d be the biggest row in the
      church that ever was. And I&rsquo;d be responsible! I would! I&rsquo;d have to go on
      the witness stand and then Laviny&rsquo;d find out how I&mdash;Oh, oh, oh! what
      SHALL I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor frightened creature&rsquo;s &ldquo;jig&rdquo; had, by this time, become a
      distracted fandango. But the housekeeper had no mercy on him. She was
      beginning to fear for her parson and, for the time, everything else, her
      own trouble and the recent interview with Nat, was pushed aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;WHAT would bring on the row in the church?
      WHO does Mr. Ellery meet? Out with it! What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that the minister meets that Van Horne girl every Sunday afternoon
      after he leaves Elkanah&rsquo;s. There, now! It&rsquo;s out, and I don&rsquo;t give a darn
      if they hang me for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah turned white. She seized Mr. Pepper by the lapel of his Sunday coat
      and shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Van Horne!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery meets Grace Van Horne on Sunday
      afternoons? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down in them pines back of Peters&rsquo;s pastur&rsquo;, on the aidge of the bank
      over the beach. He&rsquo;s met her there every Sunday for the last six weeks&mdash;longer,
      for what I know. I&rsquo;ve watched &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You HAVE? YOU have! You&rsquo;ve dared to spy on&mdash;I think you&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo; to
      me. I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t lyin&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s so. I&rsquo;ll bet you anything they&rsquo;re there now, walkin&rsquo; 
      up and down and talkin&rsquo;. What would I want to lie for? You come with me
      this minute and I&rsquo;ll show &lsquo;em to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the desire to prove his veracity he was on his way to the door. But
      Keziah stepped in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bish Pepper,&rdquo; she said slowly and fiercely, shaking a forefinger in his
      face, &ldquo;you go straight home and stay there. Don&rsquo;t you breathe a word to a
      livin&rsquo; soul of what you say you&rsquo;ve seen. Don&rsquo;t you even think it, or&mdash;or
      dream it. If you do I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll march straight to Laviny and tell her
      that you asked me to marry you. I will, as sure as you&rsquo;re shakin&rsquo; in front
      of me this minute. Now you swear to me to keep still. Swear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;HOW&rsquo;ll I swear?&rdquo; begged Kyan. &ldquo;What do you say when you swear?
      I&rsquo;ll say it, Keziah! I&rsquo;ll say anything! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Then mind you remember. Now clear out quick. I want to think.
      I MUST think. GO! Get out of my sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan went, glad to escape, but frightened to the soul of him. Keziah
      watched him until he turned from the main road into the lighthouse lane.
      Then, certain that he really was going straight home, she re-entered the
      parsonage and sat down in the nearest chair. For ten minutes she sat
      there, striving to grasp the situation. Then she rose and, putting on her
      bonnet and shawl, locked the dining-room door, and went out through the
      kitchen. On the step she looked cautiously back to see if any of the
      neighbors were at their windows. But this was Sunday, the one day when
      Trumet people sat in their front parlors. The coast was clear. She hurried
      through the back yard, and down the path leading across the fields. She
      was going to the pine grove by the shore, going to find out for herself if
      Kyan&rsquo;s astonishing story was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      For if it was true, if the Rev. John Ellery was meeting clandestinely the
      adopted daughter of Eben Hammond, it meant&mdash;what might it not mean,
      in Trumet? If he had fallen in love with a Come-Outer, with Grace Van
      Horne of all people, if he should dare think of marrying her, it would
      mean the utter wreck of his career as a Regular clergyman. His own society
      would turn him out instantly. All sorts of things would be said, lies and
      scandal would be invented and believed. His character would be riddled by
      the Trumet gossips and the papers would publish the result broadcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Grace! If she loved a Regular minister, what would happen to her?
      Captain Eben would turn her from his door, that was certain. Although he
      idolized the girl, Keziah knew that he would never countenance such a
      marriage. And if Nat stood by Grace, as he would be almost sure to do, the
      breach between father and son would widen beyond healing. If it were
      merely a matter of personal selection, Mrs. Coffin would rather have seen
      her parson marry Grace than anyone else on earth. As it was, such a match
      must not be. It meant ruin for both. She must prevent the affair going
      further. She must break off the intimacy. She must save those two young
      people from making a mistake which would&mdash;She wrung her hands as she
      thought of it. Of her own sorrow and trouble she characteristically
      thought nothing now. Sacrifice of self was a part of Keziah&rsquo;s nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pines were a deep-green blotch against the cloudy sky and the gloomy
      waters of the bay. She skirted the outlying clumps of bayberry and beach
      plum bushes and entered the grove. The pine needles made a soft carpet
      which deadened her footfalls, and the shadows beneath the boughs were
      thick and black. She tiptoed on until she reached the clearing by the
      brink of the bluff. No one was in sight. She drew a breath of relief. Kyan
      might be mistaken, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she heard low voices. As she crouched at the edge of the grove, two
      figures passed slowly across the clearing, along the bush-bordered path
      and into the shrubbery beyond. John Ellery was walking with Grace Van
      Horne. He was holding her hand in his and they were talking very
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah did not follow. What would have been the use? This was not the time
      to speak. She KNEW now and she knew, also, that the responsibility was
      hers. She must go home at once, go home to be alone and to think. She
      tiptoed back through the grove and across the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, if she had waited, she might have seen something else which would
      have been, at least, interesting. She had scarcely reached the outer edge
      of the grove when another figure passed stealthily along that narrow path
      by the bluff edge. A female figure treading very carefully, rising to peer
      over the bushes at the minister and Grace. The figure of Miss Annabel
      Daniels, the &ldquo;belle&rdquo; of Trumet. And Annabel&rsquo;s face was not pleasant to
      look upon.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH CAPTAIN EBEN RECEIVES A CALLER
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the edge of the bluff, just where the pines and the bayberry bushes
      were thickest, where the narrow, crooked little footpath dipped over the
      rise and down to the pasture land and the salt meadow, John Ellery and
      Grace had halted in their walk. It was full tide and the miniature
      breakers plashed amid the seaweed on the beach. The mist was drifting in
      over the bay and the gulls were calling sleepily from their perch along
      the breakwater. A night hawk swooped and circled above the tall &ldquo;feather
      grass&rdquo; by the margin of the creek. The minister&rsquo;s face was pale, but set
      and determined, and he was speaking rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it. I have made up my mind and
      nothing can change it, nothing but you. It rests with you. If you say yes,
      then nothing else matters. Will you say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was holding both her hands now, and though she tried to withdraw them,
      he would not let her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered brokenly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. Think of your church and of
      your people. What would they say if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, you do. Not now, perhaps, but later you will. You don&rsquo;t know
      Trumet as I know it. No, it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you there is only one impossible thing. That is that I give you
      up. I won&rsquo;t do it. I CAN&rsquo;T do it! Grace, this is life and death for me. My
      church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused in spite of himself. His church, his first church! He had
      accepted the call with pride and a determination to do his best, the very
      best that was in him, for the society and for the people whom he was to
      lead. Some of those people he had learned to love; many of them, he felt
      sure, loved him. His success, his popularity, the growth of the
      organization and the praise which had come to him because of it, all these
      had meant, and still meant, very much to him. No wonder he paused, but the
      pause was momentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My church,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is my work and I like it. I believe I&rsquo;ve done
      some good here and I hope to do more. But no church shall say whom I shall
      marry. If you care for me, Grace, as I think and hope you do, we&rsquo;ll face
      the church and the town together, and they will respect us for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them might respect you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They would say you had been
      led into this by me and were not so much to blame. But I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall respect my wife,&rdquo; he interrupted, snapping his teeth together,
      &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;ll tell you the reason,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;No, John, no! we
      mustn&rsquo;t think of it. You can see we mustn&rsquo;t. This has all been a mistake,
      a dreadful mistake, and I am to blame for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only mistake has been our meeting in this way. We should have met
      openly; I realize it, and have felt it for sometime. It was my fault, not
      yours. I was afraid, I guess. But I&rsquo;ll not be a coward any longer. Come,
      dear, let&rsquo;s not be afraid another day. Only say you&rsquo;ll marry me and I&rsquo;ll
      proclaim it openly, to-night&mdash;Yes, from the pulpit, if you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated and he took courage from her hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;You WILL say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t! My uncle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your uncle shall hear it from me. We&rsquo;ll go to him together. I&rsquo;ll tell him
      myself. He worships you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. He does worship me. That&rsquo;s why I am sure he had rather see
      me dead than married to you, a Regular, and a Regular minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. He can&rsquo;t be so unreasonable. If he is, then you
      shouldn&rsquo;t humor such bigotry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been my father for years, and a dear, kind father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so certain we can make him understand. Come, dear!
      come! Why should you consider everyone else? Consider your own happiness.
      Consider mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am considering yours,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is what I consider most of all.
      And, as for uncle, I know&mdash;I KNOW he would never consent. His heart
      is set on something else. Nat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat? Are you considering him, too? Is HE to stand between us? What right
      has he to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! He hasn&rsquo;t said anything. But&mdash;but he and uncle have
      quarreled, just a little. I didn&rsquo;t tell you, but they have. And I think I
      know the reason. Nat is Uncle Eben&rsquo;s idol. If the quarrel should grow more
      serious, I believe it would break his heart. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to be the
      cause of that; I should never forgive myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You the cause? How could you be the cause of a quarrel between those two?
      Grace, think of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was the selfishness of man and the unselfishness of woman answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is of you I am thinking. Everything else could&mdash;might
      be overcome, perhaps. But I must think of your future and your life. I
      MUST. That is why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait to hear more. He seized her in his arms and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you DO care!&rdquo; he cried joyfully. &ldquo;You will marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she lay quiet in his embrace, receiving, if not responding
      to his caresses. Then she gently but firmly freed herself. He saw that
      there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t hesitate any longer. You were meant
      to be my wife. We were brought together for just that. I know it. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was crying softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! I must think&mdash;I MUST!
      Wait, please wait, John. Perhaps by to-morrow I can answer. I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      try. Don&rsquo;t ask me again, now. Let me think. Oh, do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless he would have asked her again. He looked as if he meant to. But
      just then, drifting through the twilight and the mist, came the sound of a
      bell, the bell of the Regular church, ringing for the Sunday evening
      meeting. They both heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace, &ldquo;that is your bell. You will be late. You must go,
      and so must I. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started down the path. He hesitated, then ran after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; he questioned eagerly. &ldquo;Tomorrow, then, you&rsquo;ll say that you
      will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perhaps, perhaps! I mustn&rsquo;t promise. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after seven when Grace reached the old tavern. The housekeeper,
      Mrs. Poundberry, was anxiously awaiting her. She wore her bonnet and
      Sunday gown and was evidently ready to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sakes alive!&rdquo; she sputtered. &ldquo;Where in the name of goodness have you
      been to? I was gettin&rsquo; scairt. Didn&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;d run off and got
      married, or sunthin&rsquo; dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace was thankful that the cloudy twilight made it impossible to see her
      face distinctly. The housekeeper rattled on without waiting for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s on the table and the kittle&rsquo;s abilin&rsquo;. You better eat in a
      hurry, &lsquo;cause it&rsquo;s meetin&rsquo; time now. Your uncle, he started ten minutes
      ago. I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; right along, too, but I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to meetin&rsquo;; I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; 
      up to Betsy E.&lsquo;s to stay all night. She&rsquo;s got a spine in her back, as the
      feller said, and ain&rsquo;t feelin&rsquo; good, so I told her I&rsquo;d come and stay a
      little spell. S&rsquo;pose you can get along to-morrow without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betsy E.&rdquo; was Mrs. Poundberry&rsquo;s second cousin, an elderly spinster living
      alone in a little house near the salt works. Grace assured her questioner
      that she could attend to the house and the meals during the following day,
      longer if the troublesome &ldquo;spine&rdquo; needed company. Mrs. Poundberry sighed,
      groaned, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t stay no longer,&rdquo; she affirmed; &ldquo;not if Betsy&rsquo;s all over spines,
      like one of them Mexican cactus plants. No, marm, my place is right here
      and I know it. Your Uncle Eben&rsquo;s mighty feeble and peaked lately. He ain&rsquo;t
      long for this world, I&rsquo;m afraid. You&rsquo;d ought to be awful good to him,
      Gracie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; was the hurried reply. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Can&rsquo;t keep track of HIM. Might&rsquo;s well try to put your
      finger on a flea. He&rsquo;s here to-day and gone yesterday, as the Scriptur&rsquo; 
      says. He ate a little mite of supper, but not much, and then off he puts.
      Says he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to walk the fog out&rsquo;n his head. I told him, s&rsquo; I, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
      walk a plaguey sight more in than you do out, THIS night,&rsquo; but he went
      just the same. He was dreadful kind of dumpy and blue this evenin&rsquo;. Seemed
      to be sort of soggy in his mind. And why he never went to meetin&rsquo; with his
      dad and why his dad never asked him TO go is more&rsquo;n I can tell. Land of
      livin&rsquo;, how I do gabble! My grandmarm used to say my tongue was loose at
      both ends and hung in the middle, and I guess she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t fur off the
      course. Good-by. Take care of yourself. You can put what&rsquo;s left of that
      mock mince pie on the top shelf in the butt&rsquo;ry and you&rsquo;d better heave a
      dish towel or sunthin&rsquo; over it to keep the ants out. There&rsquo;s more ants in
      this house than there is dollars, a good sight. Betsy B., she&rsquo;s got a plan
      for keepin&rsquo; of &lsquo;em out by puttin&rsquo; sassers of brimstone round the shelves,
      but I told her, s&rsquo; I, &lsquo;THEM ants don&rsquo;t care for no brimstone. They&rsquo;re used
      to it. Sometimes I b&rsquo;lieve they&rsquo;re sent by the everlastin&rsquo; father of
      brimstone,&rsquo; and she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had reached the gate by this time, and Grace shut off the flow of
      conversation by closing the door. Then she took a candle from the row on
      the dining-room mantel, lighted it, and went up to her own room. Standing
      before the old-fashioned bureau with its little oval mirror, she hastily
      arranged her hair. She did not wish to go to the prayer meeting at the
      chapel, but she felt that she must. The Come-Outer gatherings, with their
      noisy singing and shouting, had grown more and more repugnant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-night, of all nights! How could she meet those people who had known
      her since she was a child, who boasted of her as one of their staunchest
      adherents, who believed in her and trusted her? How could she meet them
      and talk with them, knowing what she knew and realizing that they, too,
      would know it on the morrow? But her uncle would miss her and be worried
      about her if she did not come. She could not bear to trouble him now; she
      never loved him so dearly, was never so anxious to humor his every wish as
      on this, perhaps the last evening they would spend together. For, though
      she would not yet admit it, even to herself, her decision was made, had
      really been made the first time John Ellery asked her weeks before. Only
      the thought of what might happen to him if she consented had caused her to
      hesitate so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blew out the candle and came out into the hall at the head of the
      stairs. She was about to descend when she heard voices. The door of the
      dining room opened and closed. She felt certain that Nat had returned and
      wondered who was with him. Then she heard her uncle&rsquo;s voice, speaking
      sharply and with unwonted sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;tis you want to see me about,&rdquo; said Captain Eben. &ldquo;You
      say it&rsquo;s important; well, it&rsquo;s got to be to keep me from my meetin&rsquo;. I
      ought to be on the Lord&rsquo;s business this minute and nothin&rsquo; worldly&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; 
      to keep me from servin&rsquo; Him. So speak quick. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice that answered was one that Grace recognized, though she had
      never before heard in it the note of agitation and undignified excitement.
      There were no ponderous pauses and &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha&rsquo;s&rdquo; now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Hammond!&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t stand there preaching.
      Lock that door! Get a lamp! Are you sure there&rsquo;s nobody but us in the
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah Daniels! Captain Elkanah visiting a Come-Outer! and the
      leader of the Come-Outers!! Grace caught her breath. What in the world&mdash;She
      started to descend and then a thought flashed to her mind. She stopped
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t the fool, Elkanah,&rdquo; she heard her uncle retort sternly. &ldquo;The
      fools are them who are deef to the call from on high. My foot was on the
      threshold of His house when you led me astray. It&rsquo;s never halted there
      afore. I warn you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Shut up! Can&rsquo;t you forget that&mdash;that Come-Outer circus of
      yours for a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elkanah Daniels, I&rsquo;ll have no blasphemy here. Another word like that and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WILL you be still and hear me? The Lord&rsquo;s business! I guess you&rsquo;ll think
      it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s business when you understand what I&rsquo;m going to tell you!
      The Lord&rsquo;s business! The devil&rsquo;s business, you better say! Will you lock
      that door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My church is waitin&rsquo; for me and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it wait. What&rsquo;s a parcel of yelling Come-Outers compared to the
      decency of this town? Stop! Shut up! Eben Hammond, I tell you that your
      precious church&mdash;yes and mine, the Regular church of Trumet&mdash;will
      go to rack and ruin if you and me don&rsquo;t pull together this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you, Elkanah Daniels, I&rsquo;ll have no blasphemy here. That little
      sanctuary up the road is founded on a rock and neither you nor any of your
      Phariseein&rsquo; priest-worshipin&rsquo; crew can shake it. The Almighty&rsquo;ll protect
      His own. As for the Reg&rsquo;lar church, that&rsquo;s no concern of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you &lsquo;tis your concern. Or if the church isn&rsquo;t, your own family
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My&mdash;my family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your own family. Huh! that makes you listen, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant of silence. Grace, crouching on the stairs, noticed
      the change in her uncle&rsquo;s voice as he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own family?&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;My own&mdash;And the Reg&rsquo;lar church&mdash;What
      do you mean? Has Nat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t. But that cussed girl of yours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Eben&rsquo;s shout rang through the house. The listener heard it, rose,
      and then sank slowly to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; shouted Captain Hammond. &ldquo;Elkanah Daniels, for your own sake now,
      be careful. If you dast to say a word, another word like that, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I dast! The hussy! But there&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo; to you. You&rsquo;re as crazy
      as a Bedlamite. Either that, or you&rsquo;re in the game with her. If you are, I
      warn you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! What game? What do you mean? Gracie! My Grace! What is it? For
      mercy sakes, Elkanah&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I wondered if I couldn&rsquo;t get some sense into you, finally. Lock
      that door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will! I will! But Elkanah&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lock it! Give me the key!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The click of the lock sounded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the lamp?&rdquo; demanded Daniels. &ldquo;And the matches? Don&rsquo;t stand there
      shaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smell of sulphur floated out into the hall. Then the sickly glow of the
      &ldquo;fluid&rdquo; lamp shone through the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; asked Elkanah. &ldquo;Are you struck dumb? Now go and see if
      there&rsquo;s anybody else in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but there ain&rsquo;t. I know there ain&rsquo;t. Hannah&rsquo;s gone and Gracie&rsquo;s
      at meetin&rsquo; by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? Humph! Well, maybe she&rsquo;s at meeting and maybe she isn&rsquo;t. Maybe she&rsquo;s
      over in Peters&rsquo;s pines, hugging and kissing that man she&rsquo;s met there every
      Sunday for I don&rsquo;t know how long&mdash;Here! let go, you old fool! Let go,
      I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chair fell to the floor with a bang. There was the sound of hard
      breathing and rapid footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; panted Daniels. &ldquo;Are you crazy? Take your hands off me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You liar!&rdquo; snarled Captain Eben. &ldquo;You low-lived liar! By the Almighty,
      Elkanah Daniels! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;You take that back or I&rsquo;ll choke the
      everlastin&rsquo; soul out of you. I will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go, you lunatic! You&rsquo;ll kill yourself. Listen! I&rsquo;m not lying. It&rsquo;s
      the truth. She&rsquo;s met a man, I tell you. Been meeting him for months, I
      guess. There! now will you listen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps had ceased, but the heavy breathing continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man!&rdquo; gasped Eben. &ldquo;A man! Gracie! It&rsquo;s a&mdash;Who is he? What&rsquo;s his
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s John Ellery, and he&rsquo;s minister of the Regular church in this
      town; that&rsquo;s who he is! Here! hold up! Good Lord! are you dying? Hold up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl on the stairs sprang to her feet. Her head was reeling and she
      could scarcely stand, but she blindly began the descent. She must go to
      her uncle. She must. But Captain Daniels&rsquo;s voice caused her to halt once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; it said in a tone of relief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Set still
      now. Be quiet, that&rsquo;s it. Shall I get some water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! let me be. Just let me be. I ain&rsquo;t what I used to be and this&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      all right, I tell you. Grace! And&mdash;and&mdash;What was it you just
      said? I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve I heard it right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that daughter of yours, or niece, or whatever she is, this Grace
      Van Horne, has been meeting young Ellery, our minister, in Peters&rsquo;s grove.
      Been meeting him and walking with him, and kissing him, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie! It ain&rsquo;t so, Elkanah! Prove it or&mdash;It&mdash;it CAN&rsquo;T be
      so, can it? Please&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so. She&rsquo;s met him in those pines every Sunday afternoon for a long
      time. She was seen there with him this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. The one that did&rsquo;ll never tell&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s necessary.
      They&rsquo;re fixing to be married, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MARRIED! She marry a Reg&rsquo;lar minister! Oh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Listen! They ain&rsquo;t married yet. We can stop &lsquo;em, you and I, if we
      get right to work. It isn&rsquo;t too late. Will you help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I&mdash;I&mdash;Go on! tell me more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can stop &lsquo;em. I know it would be a good catch for her, the sneaking,
      designing&mdash;Well, never mind. But it can&rsquo;t be. It shan&rsquo;t be. You&rsquo;ve
      got to tell her so, Hammond. We folks of the Regular church have pride in
      our society; we won&rsquo;t have it disgraced. And we have been proud of our
      minister, the young, rattle-headed fool! We&rsquo;ll save him if we can. If we
      can&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker&rsquo;s teeth grated&mdash;&ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll send him to
      eternal smash or die trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s a mistake; some other girl and not
      Gracie. Why, she don&rsquo;t even know him. She wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;But she HAS been
      out every Sunday afternoon for weeks. If it SHOULD be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is. I tell you it is. Don&rsquo;t waste time rolling your eyes and talking
      stuff. We&rsquo;ve got to work and you&rsquo;ve got to work first. I don&rsquo;t know
      whether you&rsquo;re only making believe or not. I realize that &lsquo;twould be a
      good thing for your girl to marry a promising young chap like him, but&mdash;Hush!
      let me go on. I tell you, Hammond, it can&rsquo;t be. We won&rsquo;t let her. I won&rsquo;t
      let her. I&rsquo;m a man of influence in this town, and outside of it, too. I&rsquo;m
      head of the parish committee and a member of the National Regular Society.
      I can&rsquo;t reach your precious ward, maybe, but I can reach the fellow she&rsquo;s
      after, and if he marries her, I&rsquo;ll drive &lsquo;em both to the poorhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you come in, Hammond. It may be she does really care for
      him. Or maybe she&rsquo;s after position and money. Well, you talk to her. You
      tell her that if she keeps on going with him, if she doesn&rsquo;t break off
      this damnable business now, tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll ruin John Ellery as sure as I&rsquo;m
      a living man. He&rsquo;ll be ruined in Trumet, anyhow. He&rsquo;ll be thrown out by
      the parish committee. I&rsquo;m not sure that his church people won&rsquo;t tar and
      feather him. Marrying a low-down Come-Outer hussy! As if there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
      decent girls of good families he might have had! But losing this church
      won&rsquo;t be the only thing that&rsquo;ll happen to him. The committee&rsquo;ll see that
      he doesn&rsquo;t get another one. I&rsquo;ll use my influence and have him thrown out
      of the Regular ministry. Think I can&rsquo;t? What sort of yarns do you suppose
      will be told about him and her, meeting the way they did? Won&rsquo;t the county
      papers print some fine tales? Won&rsquo;t the Boston ones enjoy such a scandal?
      I tell you, Eben Hammond, that young chap&rsquo;s name will be dragged so deep
      in the mud it&rsquo;ll never get clean again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for breath. His companion was silent. After a moment, he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell her that, Hammond,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;If she really cares for him,
      it&rsquo;ll be enough. She won&rsquo;t let him ruin his life. And I&rsquo;ll keep quiet till
      I hear from you. If she&rsquo;s sensible and really decent, then she can give
      him his clearance papers without his knowing why she did it and everything
      will be a secret and kept so. Nobody else&rsquo;ll ever know. If she won&rsquo;t do
      that, then you tell me and I&rsquo;ll have a session with HIM. If THAT&rsquo;S no
      good, then out he goes and she with him; and it&rsquo;s ruination for both of
      &lsquo;em, reputations and all. Why am I doing this? I&rsquo;ll tell you. I like him.
      He isn&rsquo;t orthodox enough to suit me, but I have liked him mighty well. And
      Annab&mdash;Humph! that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. What I&rsquo;m fighting for is
      the Trumet Regular church. That&rsquo;s MY church and I&rsquo;ll have no dirty scandal
      with Come-Outers dragging it down. Now you understand. Will you tell her
      what I&rsquo;ve said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chair creaked. Evidently, Captain Eben was rising slowly to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; repeated Elkanah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elkanah Daniels,&rdquo; said Eben slowly, his voice shaking from nervous
      exhaustion and weakness, but with a fine ring of determination in every
      word, &ldquo;Elkanah Daniels, you listen to me. I&rsquo;ve heard you through. If your
      yarn is true, then my heart is broke, and I wish I might have died afore I
      heard it. But I didn&rsquo;t die and I have heard it. Now listen to me. I love
      that girl of mine better&rsquo;n the whole wide world and yet I&rsquo;d ruther see her
      dead afore me than married to a Reg&rsquo;lar minister. Disgrace to HIM!
      Disgrace to your miser&rsquo;ble church! What about the disgrace to MINE? And
      the disgrace to HER? Ruin to your minister! Ruin to my girl here and
      hereafter is what I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; of; that and my people who worship God with
      me. I&rsquo;ll talk to Grace. I&rsquo;ll talk to her. But not of what&rsquo;ll happen to him
      or you&mdash;or any of your cantin&rsquo;, lip-servin&rsquo; crew. I&rsquo;ll tell her to
      choose between him and me. And if she chooses him, I&rsquo;ll send her out of
      that door. I&rsquo;ll do my duty and read her out of my congregation. And I&rsquo;ll
      know she&rsquo;s gone to everlastin&rsquo; hell, and that&rsquo;s worse&rsquo;n the poorhouse.
      That&rsquo;s all to-night, Elkanah. Now you better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, I declare! you ARE a bigoted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it! I&rsquo;ve kept my hands off you so fur, because I&rsquo;m the Lord&rsquo;s
      servant. But I&rsquo;m fightin&rsquo; hard to keep down my old salt-water temper. You
      go! There&rsquo;s the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right! I don&rsquo;t care what you say, so long as it&rsquo;s said so
      as to stop her from getting him&mdash;and said soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be said to-night. Now go! My people are waitin&rsquo; at the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to that prayer meeting after THIS?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else should I go? &lsquo;Come unto Me all ye that labor and are heavy
      laden.&rsquo; And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;&ldquo;He knows that I AM
      heavy laden. Lord! Lord! do help me, for this is more&rsquo;n I can bear alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lock turned; the door opened and closed. Grace, clinging to the
      balusters, heard Captain Hammond cross the room, slowly and feebly. She
      heard him enter the sitting room. Then she heard nothing more, not another
      sound, though the minutes dragged on and on, endlessly, eternally, and
      each with a message, a sentence repeated over and over again in her brain.
      &ldquo;If she really cares for him, she won&rsquo;t let him ruin his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by, pale, but more composed, and with her mind made up, she came
      down into the hall. Drawing a long breath, she turned into the sitting
      room to face her uncle. By the light shining through the dining-room door
      she saw him on his knees by the haircloth sofa. She spoke his name. He did
      not answer nor look up. Alarmed, she touched him on the shoulder. At her
      touch his arm slid from the couch and he fell gently over upon his side on
      the carpet.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH CAPTAIN EBEN MAKES PORT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Half past eight. In the vestry of the Regular church John Ellery was
      conducting his prayer meeting. The attendance was as large as usual. Three
      seats, however, were vacant, and along the settees people were wondering
      where Captain Elkanah Daniels and his daughter might be. They had not
      missed a service for many a day. And where was Keziah Coffin?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Come-Outer chapel the testifying and singing were in full blast.
      But Ezekiel Bassett was leading, for Captain Eben Hammond had not made his
      appearance. Neither had Grace Van Horne, for that matter, but Captain
      Eben&rsquo;s absence was the most astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s the matter,&rdquo; whispered Josiah Badger to his right-hand
      neighbor. &ldquo;Somethin&rsquo;s wrong d-d-d-down to the tavern, sartin&rsquo; sure. I&rsquo;m
      goin&rsquo; down there just soon&rsquo;s meetin&rsquo;s over and f-f-f-find out. Eben
      wouldn&rsquo;t no more miss leadin&rsquo; his meetin&rsquo; from choice than I&rsquo;d go without
      a meal&rsquo;s v-v-vi-vittles. Somethin&rsquo;s happened and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to know what
      &lsquo;tis. You&rsquo;ll go along with me, won&rsquo;t ye, Lot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was an affirmative. In fact, almost every worshiper in that
      chapel had determined to visit the Hammond tavern as soon as the service
      was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Regular parsonage Keziah sat alone by the sitting-room table.
      Prayer meeting and supper she had forgotten entirely. The minister had not
      come home for his evening meal, and food was furthest from the
      housekeeper&rsquo;s thoughts. What should she do? What ought she to do? How
      could she avert the disaster so certain to overwhelm those two young
      people the moment their secret became known?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that she tried to encourage herself with the hope that Kyan
      had exaggerated&mdash;that the meetings in the grove had not been as
      frequent as he said they were, or that they had been merely casual. She
      knew better. She had seen the pair together and the look in John Ellery&rsquo;s
      eyes. No, the mischief was done, they loved each other; or, at least, he
      loved her. There was the great trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah, in spite of her worldly common sense, was an idealist at heart.
      Love matches she believed in thoroughly. If the man had not been a Regular
      minister, or if he had been a minister in any other town than narrow,
      gossiping, squabbling Trumet, where families were divided on &ldquo;religious&rdquo;
       grounds, neighbors did not speak because their creeds were different, and
      even after death were buried in cemeteries three miles apart; if the girl
      had been other than the ward of bigoted old Eben Hammond&mdash;then,
      though they were poor as poverty itself, Keziah would have joined their
      hands and rejoiced. Even as it was, she was strongly tempted to do it. Her
      sense of right and her every inclination urged her toward that course.
      &ldquo;Face the world together and fight it out,&rdquo; that was the advice she would
      like to give them. But no, the battle was too uneven. The odds were too
      great. They must not think of marriage, for the present, and they must
      cease to meet. Perhaps some day&mdash;she tried to comfort herself with
      the thought&mdash;perhaps some day, years afterwards and under different
      circumstances, they might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;With Ellery she felt certain she could accomplish nothing by
      argument or persuasion. She knew him well enough by this time to realize
      that, if his mind was made up, all Trumet and all creation could not
      change it. He would keep on his course, and, if wrecked, would go down
      with colors set and helm lashed. But Grace, perhaps she did not fully
      realize the situation. She might be made to see, to listen to reason. And,
      perhaps, it was possible&mdash;perhaps, on her part, matters were not as
      serious. The minister had not acted like a triumphant lover, assured of
      success; he had seemed, now that she thought of it, more like a pleader, a
      supplicant. Perhaps, if she could see Grace and talk plainly with the
      girl, it might not be too late. She determined to try that very night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and again donned her bonnet and shawl. She was about to blow out
      the lamp when she heard rapid footsteps, the sound of some one running
      along the sidewalk in front of the house. As she listened, the footsteps
      sounded on the path. Whoever the runner was he was coming to the
      parsonage. She stepped to the door and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner was a boy, Maria Higgins&rsquo;s boy Isaac, whose widowed mother
      lived down by the shore. He did the chores at the Hammond tavern. His
      freckled face was dripping with perspiration and he puffed and blew like a
      stranded whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ike?&rdquo; demanded Keziah. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have ye&mdash;have ye,&rdquo; panted Ike, &ldquo;have ye seen the doctor anywheres,
      Mis Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Dr. Parker? Have I seen&mdash;what in the world are you comin&rsquo; HERE
      after the doctor for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause&mdash;&lsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t know where else to come. I been to his house
      and he ain&rsquo;t to home. Nobody ain&rsquo;t to home. His wife, Mis Parker, she&rsquo;s
      gone up to Boston yes&rsquo;day on the coach, and&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all dark and
      the house door&rsquo;s open and the shay&rsquo;s gone, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s sick? Who wants him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;all the rest of the houses round here was shut up
      &lsquo;cause everybody&rsquo;s to meetin&rsquo;. I peeked in at the meetin&rsquo; house and he
      ain&rsquo;t there, and I see your light and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s sick? Tell me that, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Eben. He&rsquo;s awful sick. I cal&rsquo;late he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to die, and Gracie,
      she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Eben? Eben Hammond! Dyin&rsquo;? What are you talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! huh!&rdquo; puffed the messenger impatiently. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell ye? Cap&rsquo;n
      Eben&rsquo;s adyin&rsquo;. I seen him. All white and still and&mdash;and awful. And
      Gracie, she&rsquo;s all alone and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone? Where&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t know. He ain&rsquo;t to home. But I got to find Dr. Parker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Stop! I&rsquo;ll tell you where the doctor is most likely. Up to Mrs.
      Prince&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s been poorly and he&rsquo;s prob&rsquo;ly been called there. Run! run
      fast as ever you can and get him and I&rsquo;ll go to Grace this minute. The
      poor thing! Have you told anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! ain&rsquo;t seen nobody but you to tell. They was prayin&rsquo; over to
      meetin&rsquo;, and the fellers that waits outside to keep comp&rsquo;ny with the girls
      ain&rsquo;t got there yet. And I never met nobody. And &lsquo;twas so blasted dark I
      fell down four times and tore my best pants and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sh-sh! Listen to me! Don&rsquo;t tell anybody. Not a soul but the doctor.
      Half this town&rsquo;ll be runnin&rsquo; to find out if you do, and that poor girl
      must be distracted already. I&rsquo;ll go to her. You get Dr. Parker and tell
      him to hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him; don&rsquo;t you fret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone, running harder than ever. A moment later Keziah followed him,
      running also.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a misty, black night, and Trumet sidewalks were uneven and hard to
      navigate. But she stumbled on, up the main road to the Corners, down the
      &ldquo;Turn-off,&rdquo; past the chapel of the Come-Outers, from the open window of
      which sounded the drone of a high, nasal voice. Josiah Badger was
      &ldquo;testifying,&rdquo; and Keziah caught a fragment of the testimony as she hurried
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says to &lsquo;em, says I, I says to &lsquo;em, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about your smart
      mum-mum-minister and what fine sermons he preaches. Let him BE smart,&rsquo; I
      says. Says I, &lsquo;Smartness won&rsquo;t g-g-g-git ye into heaven.&rsquo; (&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;) &lsquo;No,
      sirree! it takes more&rsquo;n that. I&rsquo;ve seen smart folks afore and they got
      c-c-cuk-catched up with sooner or later. Pride goes ahead of a tumble,
      I&rsquo;ve heard tell, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all that Keziah heard of Mr. Badger&rsquo;s testimony, for, as she ran
      on, a rattle of wheels and the thud of hoofs came from behind her. Then a
      rocking chaise, drawn by a galloping horse, shot by. Dr. Parker&rsquo;s
      carriage, she was sure. The Higgins boy must have met the doctor and
      delivered his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse and chaise were standing by the front gate of the tavern as she
      pantingly drew near it. The side door of the house was ajar and she opened
      it softly and entered. The dining room was empty. There was a light on the
      sitting-room table and low voices came from the little bedroom adjoining.
      Then, from the bedroom, emerged Dr. Parker and Grace Van Horne. The girl
      was white and there were dark circles under her eyes. The doctor was very
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah stepped forward and held out both hands. Grace looked, recognized
      her, and with a cry ran toward her. Keziah took her in her arms and
      soothed her as if she were a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! deary,&rdquo; she said, stroking her hair. &ldquo;There! there! deary,
      don&rsquo;t take it so hard. Poor thing! you&rsquo;re worn out. If I&rsquo;d only known
      sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Aunt Keziah!&rdquo; sobbed the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come. It was so good
      of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Land of mercy! If I hadn&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;d have been worse than the
      beasts that perish. Don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t. How is he now? Some better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the doctor as she asked it. He shook his head emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, dear,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Coffin hurriedly. &ldquo;He will be pretty
      soon, we&rsquo;ll hope. You mustn&rsquo;t give up the ship, you know. Now you go and
      lay down somewheres and I&rsquo;ll get my things off and see what there is to
      do. Some good strong tea might be good for all hands, I guess likely.
      Where&rsquo;s Hannah Poundberry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to her cousin&rsquo;s to stay all night. I suppose I ought to send
      for her, but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you hadn&rsquo;t. Might&rsquo;s well send for a poll parrot, the critter
      would be just as much good and talk less. I&rsquo;ll look out for things, me and
      the doctor. Where&rsquo;s&mdash;where&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came in just after I sent the boy for the doctor. He&rsquo;s in there with&mdash;with
      him,&rdquo; indicating the bedroom. &ldquo;Poor Nat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah looked longingly toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Poor fellow, it&rsquo;s an awful shock to him. He and
      his father are&mdash;But there! you lay down on that lounge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lie down. I can&rsquo;t do anything but think. Oh, what a dreadful day
      this has been! And I thought it was going to be such a happy one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, deary, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know?&rdquo; she repeated, looking up into the housekeeper&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean I know it&rsquo;s been a dreadful day,&rdquo; explained Keziah quickly. &ldquo;Yes,
      indeed it has,&rdquo; with a sigh. &ldquo;But there! our moanin&rsquo; over it don&rsquo;t cheer
      it up any. Will you lay down? No? Well, then, SET down, there&rsquo;s a good
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace, protesting that she couldn&rsquo;t sit down, she couldn&rsquo;t leave uncle,
      and there were so many things to do, was at last persuaded by Keziah and
      the doctor to rest for a few moments in the big rocker. Then Mrs. Coffin
      went into the kitchen to prepare the tea. As she went, she beckoned to Dr.
      Parker, who joined her a moment later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout, gray-haired old physician&mdash;he had practiced in Trumet for
      nearly thirty years&mdash;shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a single chance,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He may possibly live till morning,
      but I doubt if he lasts an hour. It&rsquo;s his heart. I&rsquo;ve expected it at any
      time. Ever since he had that shock, I&rsquo;ve been at him to take things easy;
      but you might as well talk to a graven image. That Come-Outer foolishness
      is what really killed him, though just what brought on this attack I can&rsquo;t
      make out. Grace says she found him lying on the floor by the sofa. He was
      unconscious then. I&rsquo;m rather worried about her. She was very near to
      fainting when I got here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder. All alone in this ark of a house and nobody to help or to
      send. Lucky she found that Ike Higgins. Say, I wonder if the young one&rsquo;s
      around here now? If he is, he must stand at the gate and scare off
      Come-Outers. The whole chapel, mates, crew, and cabin boy, &lsquo;ll be down
      here soon&rsquo;s meetin&rsquo;s over to see what kept Eben. And they mustn&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not. I&rsquo;ll hunt up Ike. If a Come-Outer gets into this house
      to-night I&rsquo;ll eat him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of &lsquo;em would give you dyspepsy, I guess. Yes, Grace, I&rsquo;ll be there
      in a jiffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor left the house to find young Higgins and post him at the gate.
      The boy, who had been listening under the window, was proud of his new
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix &lsquo;em, doctor,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I only hope old Zeke Bassett comes.
      He lammed me with a horsewhip t&rsquo;other day, &lsquo;cause I was ridin&rsquo; behind his
      ox cart. If he tried to git by me, I&rsquo;ll bounce a rock off&rsquo;n his Sunday
      hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; whispered Keziah from the kitchen window. &ldquo;Doctor, come quick.
      Nat wants you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nat was standing at the door of the bedroom. His face was drawn
      and he had seemingly grown years older since noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come to himself, doc,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t remember how it
      happened or anything. And he wants us all. Why! why, Keziah! are you
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nat. I&rsquo;ve been here a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her steadily and his eyes brightened just a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come to see me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Was it about what I said this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Nat; no. I heard the news and that Grace was alone; so I come
      right down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come in, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know dad likes you and I guess&mdash;Wait
      a minute; I&rsquo;ll ask him.&rdquo; He stepped back into the bedroom. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he
      nodded, returning, &ldquo;you come, too. He wants you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little room, Captain Eben&rsquo;s own, was more like a skipper&rsquo;s cabin than
      a chamber on land. A narrow, single bed, a plain washstand, a battered,
      painted bureau and a single chair&mdash;these made up the list of
      furniture. Two pictures, both of schooners under full sail, hung on the
      walls. Beside them hung a ship&rsquo;s barometer, a sextant, and a clock that
      struck the &ldquo;bells,&rdquo; instead of the hours as the landsman understands them.
      In the corner stood the captain&rsquo;s big boots and his oilskins hung above
      them. His Sunday cane was there also. And on the bureau was a worn, heavy
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker brushed by the others and bent over the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s she headed? How are you feeling
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old face on the pillow smiled feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s headed for home, I guess, doc,&rdquo; said Captain Eben. &ldquo;Bound for home,
      and the harbor light broad abeam, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! you&rsquo;ll make a good many voyages yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this hulk, I won&rsquo;t, doctor. I hope I&rsquo;ll have a new command pretty
      soon. I&rsquo;m trustin&rsquo; in my owners and I guess they&rsquo;ll do the fair thing by
      me. Halloo, Gracie, girl! Well, your old uncle&rsquo;s on his beam ends, ain&rsquo;t
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace glanced fearfully at his face. When he spoke her name she shrank
      back, as if she feared what he might say. But he only smiled as, with the
      tears streaming down her face, she bent over and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t cry. What are you cryin&rsquo; about
      me for? We know, you and me, who&rsquo;s been lookin&rsquo; out for us and keepin&rsquo; us
      on the course all these years. We ain&rsquo;t got anything to cry for. You just
      keep on bein&rsquo; a &lsquo;good girl, Gracie, and goin&rsquo; to the right church and&mdash;I
      s&rsquo;pose Ezekiel&rsquo;ll lead in meetin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I do wish he was a
      stronger man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, whose fingers had been upon the old man&rsquo;s wrist, looked up at
      Nat significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, dad,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you worry about Zeke Bassett, nor
      anything else. You just lay in dry dock and let Parker here overhaul your
      runnin&rsquo; riggin&rsquo; and get you fit for sea. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fit and ready for the sea I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to sail,&rdquo; was the answer. His
      eyes wandered from his son to Mrs. Coffin. For an instant he seemed
      puzzled. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Evenin&rsquo;, Keziah. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re here, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that Grace was alone and that you was sick, Eben. So I come right
      down, to help if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye. You&rsquo;re a good-hearted woman, Keziah, even though you ain&rsquo;t seen
      the true light yet. And you&rsquo;re housekeeper for that hired priest&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused, and a troubled look came over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, dad?&rdquo; asked Nat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;Where&rsquo;s Gracie? She&rsquo;s here, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle, I&rsquo;m here. Here I am,&rdquo; said the girl. His fingers groped for
      her hand and seized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; murmured Captain Eben. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;for a
      minute or so, I&mdash;I had an awful dream about you, Gracie. I dreamed&mdash;Never
      mind. Doc, answer me this now, true and honest, man to man: Can you keep
      me here for just a little spell longer? Can you? Try! Ten minutes, say.
      Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can. Cap&rsquo;n Hammond, what are you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s all right. But I ain&rsquo;t a young one to be petted and lied
      to. I&rsquo;m a man. I&rsquo;ve sailed ships. I&rsquo;ve been on blue water. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
      make port pretty soon, and I know it, but I want to get my decks clear
      fust, if I can. Gracie, stand still. Nat, run alongside where I can see
      you plainer. Keziah, you and the doctor stay where you be. I want you to
      witness this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; protested Dr. Parker, &ldquo;if I were you I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay! Silence there, for&rsquo;ard! Nat, you&rsquo;re my boy, ain&rsquo;t you? You set
      some store by the old man, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I do, dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess you do, too. You&rsquo;ve been a pretty good boy; stubborn and
      pig-headed sometimes, but, take you by and large, pretty good. And Gracie,
      you&rsquo;ve been a mighty good girl. Never done nothin&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t like,
      nothin&rsquo; mean nor underhand nor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, uncle! Hush! Please hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ain&rsquo;t; so why should I hush? In this&mdash;this dream I had,
      seems &lsquo;sif you&mdash;seems as if a man come to me and said that you was&mdash;It
      WAS a dream, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to rise. Nat and the doctor started forward. Grace shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said the doctor briskly. &ldquo;Now you mustn&rsquo;t fret
      yourself in this way. Just lie still and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay, I tell you. Yes, I guess &lsquo;twas a dream. It had to be, but &lsquo;twas so
      sort of real that I&mdash;How long have I been this way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little while! Now just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t pull your hand away, Gracie. Nat, give me yours. That&rsquo;s it.
      Now I put them two hands together. See, doctor? See, Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wandering. We must stop this,&rdquo; muttered Parker. Mrs. Coffin, who
      began to comprehend what was coming, looked fearfully at Nat and the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t wanderin&rsquo;, neither,&rdquo; declared the old Come-Outer fretfully.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sane as ever I was and if you try to stop me I&rsquo;ll&mdash;Gracie, your
      Uncle Eben&rsquo;s v&rsquo;yage is &lsquo;most over. He&rsquo;s almost to his moorin&rsquo;s and they&rsquo;re
      waitin&rsquo; for him on the pier. I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t be long now. Just a little
      while, Lord! Give me just a little while to get my house in order. Gracie,
      I don&rsquo;t want to go till I know you&rsquo;ll be looked out for. I&rsquo;ve spoke to Nat
      about this, but I ain&rsquo;t said much to you. Seems if I hadn&rsquo;t, anyhow; I
      ain&rsquo;t real sartin; my head&rsquo;s all full of bells ringin&rsquo; and&mdash;and
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, uncle, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; pleaded Grace. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. Think of
      yourself, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sh-sh! Don&rsquo;t put me off. Just listen. I want you to marry my boy, after
      I&rsquo;m gone. I want you to say you will&mdash;say it now, so&rsquo;s I can hear it.
      Will you, Gracie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace would have withdrawn her hand, but he would not let her. He clung to
      it and to that of his son with all his failing strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, Gracie?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the last thing I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to ask of
      you. I&rsquo;ve tried to be sort of good to you, in my way, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Let me think a minute, uncle, dear. Oh, do
      let me think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got time, Gracie. You&rsquo;ll have to say it now, or else&mdash;All
      right, then, think; but think quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace was thinking. &ldquo;If she really cares for him, she won&rsquo;t let him ruin
      his life.&rdquo; That was what Captain Elkanah had said. And here was a way to
      save him from ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you say it for me, Gracie?&rdquo; pleaded Captain Eben. She hesitated no
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; she answered through tears, &ldquo;if Nat wants me he can have
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah clasped her hands. Captain Eben&rsquo;s face lit up with a great joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Almighty!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Lord, I do thank you. Nat, boy,
      you&rsquo;re consider&rsquo;ble older than she is and you&rsquo;ll have to plan for her. You
      be a good husband to her all her days, won&rsquo;t ye? Why, what are you waitin&rsquo; 
      for? Why don&rsquo;t you answer me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minute, dad,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Just give me a minute, for Heaven sakes!
      Keziah&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah!&rdquo; repeated Eben. &ldquo;Keziah? What are you talkin&rsquo; to HER for? She
      knows there couldn&rsquo;t be no better match in the world. You do know it,
      don&rsquo;t ye, Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Keziah slowly. &ldquo;I guess&mdash;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Eben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah Coffin,&rdquo; cried Nat Hammond, &ldquo;do you tell me to marry Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nat, I&mdash;I think your father&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;what difference does&mdash;All right, dad. Just as
      Grace says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; cried Captain Eben. &ldquo;Doctor, you and Mrs. Coffin are
      witnesses to this. There! now my decks are clear and I&rsquo;d better get ready
      to land. Gracie, girl, the Good Book&rsquo;s over there on the bureau. Read me a
      chapter, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Keziah sat alone in the dining room. She had stolen away
      when the reading began. Dr. Parker, walking very softly, came to her and
      laid his hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said simply.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH BREAKS THE NEWS
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock, gray dawn of what was to be a clear, beautiful
      summer morning, when Keziah softly lifted the latch and entered the
      parsonage. All night she had been busy at the Hammond tavern. Busy with
      the doctor and the undertaker, who had been called from his bed by young
      Higgins; busy with Grace, soothing her, comforting her as best she could,
      and petting her as a mother might pet a stricken child. The poor girl was
      on the verge of prostration, and from hysterical spasms of sobs and
      weeping passed to stretches of silent, dry-eyed agony which were harder to
      witness and much more to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all my fault,&rdquo; she repeated over and over again. &ldquo;All my fault! I
      killed him! I killed him, Aunt Keziah! What shall I do? Oh, why couldn&rsquo;t I
      have died instead? It would have been so much better, better for
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ss-sh! ss-sh! deary,&rdquo; murmured the older woman. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so; you
      mustn&rsquo;t talk so. Your uncle was ready to go. He&rsquo;s been ready for ever so
      long, and those of us who knew how feeble he was expected it any time.
      &lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t your fault at all and he&rsquo;d say so if he was here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;d say just as I do, that I was to blame. You don&rsquo;t
      know, Aunt Keziah. Nobody knows but me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I do, Gracie, dear; maybe I do. Maybe I understand better&rsquo;n you
      think I do. And it&rsquo;s all been for the best. You&rsquo;ll think so, too, one of
      these days. It seems hard now; it is awful hard, you poor thing, but it&rsquo;s
      all for the best, I&rsquo;m sure. Best for everyone. It&rsquo;s a mercy he went sudden
      and rational, same as he did. The doctor says that, if he hadn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d
      have been helpless and bedridden and, maybe, out of his head for another
      year. He couldn&rsquo;t have lived longer&rsquo;n that, at the most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you DON&rsquo;T know, Aunt Keziah! You don&rsquo;t know what I&mdash;I AM to
      blame. I&rsquo;ll never forgive myself. And I&rsquo;ll never be happy again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will. You&rsquo;ll come, some day, to think it was best and right, for
      you and&mdash;and for others. I know you think you&rsquo;ll never get over it,
      but you will. Somehow or other you will, same as the rest of us have had
      to do. The Lord tries us mighty hard sometimes, but He gives us the
      strength to bear it. There! there! don&rsquo;t, deary, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker was very anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must rest,&rdquo; he told Mrs. Coffin. &ldquo;She must, or her brain will give
      way. I&rsquo;m going to give her something to make her sleep and you must get
      her to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Keziah tried and, at last, Grace did take the drug. In a little while
      she was sleeping, uneasily and with moans and sobbings, but sleeping,
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s your turn, Keziah,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You go home now and rest,
      yourself. We don&rsquo;t need you any more just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;where&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Nat?&rdquo; asked Keziah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there with his father. He bears it well, although he is mighty
      cut up. Poor chap, he seems to feel that he is to blame, somehow. Says
      Cap&rsquo;n Eben and he had disagreed about something or other and he fears that
      hastened the old man&rsquo;s death. Nonsense, of course. It was bound to come
      and I told him so. &lsquo;Twas those blasted Come-Outers who really did it,
      although I shan&rsquo;t say so to anyone but you. I&rsquo;m glad Nat and the girl have
      agreed to cruise together. It&rsquo;s a mighty good arrangement. She couldn&rsquo;t
      have a better man to look out for her and he couldn&rsquo;t have a better wife.
      I suppose I&rsquo;m at liberty to tell people of the engagement, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I don&rsquo;t see any reason why not. Yes&mdash;I guess likely you&rsquo;d
      better tell &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Now you go home. You&rsquo;ve had a hard night, like the rest of
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How hard he had no idea. And Keziah, as she wearily entered the parsonage,
      realized that the morning would be perhaps the hardest of all. For upon
      her rested the responsibility of seeing that the minister&rsquo;s secret was
      kept. And she, and no other, must break the news to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining room was dark and gloomy. She lighted the lamp. Then she heard
      a door open and Ellery&rsquo;s voice, as he called down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was startled. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said softly, after a moment. &ldquo;Yes, Mr.
      Ellery, it&rsquo;s me. What are you doin&rsquo; awake at such an hour&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m awake. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep well to-night, somehow. Too much to
      think of, I imagine. But where have you been? Why weren&rsquo;t you at meeting?
      And where&mdash;Why, it&rsquo;s almost morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer at once. The temptation was to say nothing now, to put
      off the trying scene as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s morning,&rdquo; repeated the minister. &ldquo;Are you sick? Has anything
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered slowly, &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; has happened. Are you dressed?
      Could you come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he would be down in a moment. When he came he found her
      standing by the table waiting for him. The look of her face in the
      lamplight shocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Coffin!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What IS it? You look as if you had been
      through some dreadful experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I have,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Maybe I have. Experiences like that come to
      us all in this life, to old folks and young, and we have to bear &lsquo;em like
      men and women. That&rsquo;s the test we&rsquo;re put to, Mr. Ellery, and the way we
      come through the fire proves the stuff we&rsquo;re made of. Sorrows and
      disappointments and heartbreaks and sicknesses and death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused on the word. He interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Death? Is some one dead, some one I know? Mrs.
      Coffin, what is it you are trying to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart went out to him. She held out both her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor boy,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to tell you one of the hardest
      things a body can tell. Yes, some one is dead, but that ain&rsquo;t all. Eben
      Hammond, poor soul, is out of his troubles and gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eben Hammond! Captain Eben? Dead! Why, why&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Eben&rsquo;s gone. He was took down sudden and died about ten o&rsquo;clock last
      night. I was there and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Eben dead! Why, he was as well as&mdash;as&mdash;She said&mdash;Oh,
      I must go! I must go at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was on his way to the door, but she held it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said gravely, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t go. You mustn&rsquo;t go, Mr. Ellery.
      That&rsquo;s the one thing you mustn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. By and by I can tell you why I must be there, but
      now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do understand. I understand it all. Lord help us! if I&rsquo;d only
      understood sooner, how much of this might have been spared. Why DIDN&rsquo;T you
      tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John&mdash;you won&rsquo;t mind my callin&rsquo; you John. I&rsquo;m old enough, pretty
      nigh, to be your mother, and I&rsquo;ve come to feel almost as if I was. John,
      you&rsquo;ve got to stay here with me. You can&rsquo;t go to that house. You can&rsquo;t go
      to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin, what are you saying? Do you know&mdash;Have you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know all about it. I know about the meetin&rsquo;s in the pines and all.
      Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you trust me and tell me? If you had, all would have been
      SO much better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in utter amazement. The blood rushed to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know THAT?&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she tell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nobody told. That is, only a little. I got a hint and I suspicioned
      somethin&rsquo; afore. The rest I saw with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now white, but his jaw shot forward and his teeth closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must realize that my place is with her.
      Now, when she is in trouble&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you want to make that trouble greater? More than she could bear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I might help her to bear it. Mrs. Coffin, you have been my truest
      friend, but one, in Trumet. You HAVE been like a mother to me. But I have
      thought this out to the end and I shall go through with it. It is my
      affair&mdash;and hers. If my own mother were alive and spoke as you do, I
      should still go through with it. It is right, it is my life. I&rsquo;m not
      ashamed of anything I&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m proud. I&rsquo;m proud of her. And humble
      only when I think how unworthy I am to be her husband. I suppose you are
      fearful of what my congregation will say. Well, I&rsquo;ve thought of that, too,
      and thought it through. Whatever they say and whatever they do will make
      no difference. Do you suppose I will let THEM keep me from her? Please
      open that door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very tragic and handsome&mdash;and young, as he stood there. The
      tears overflowed the housekeeper&rsquo;s eyes as she looked at him. If her own
      love story had not been broken off at its beginning, if she had not thrown
      her life away, she might have had a son like that. She would have given
      all that the years had in store for her, given it gladly, to have been
      able to open the door and bid him go. But she was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the congregation, John,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nor Trumet, nor your
      ministry. That means more&rsquo;n you think it does, now; but it ain&rsquo;t that. You
      mustn&rsquo;t go to her because&mdash;well, because she don&rsquo;t want you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t want me? I know better.&rdquo; He laughed in supreme scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want you, John. She wouldn&rsquo;t see you if you went. She would
      send you away again, sure, sartin sure. She would. And if you didn&rsquo;t go
      when she sent you, you wouldn&rsquo;t be the man I hope you are. John, you
      mustn&rsquo;t see Grace again. She ain&rsquo;t yours. She belongs to some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one else!&rdquo; He repeated the words in a whisper. &ldquo;Some one ELSE? Why,
      Mrs. Coffin, you must be crazy! If you expect me to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! I ain&rsquo;t crazy, though there&rsquo;s times when I wonder I ain&rsquo;t.
      John, you and Grace have known each other for a few months, that&rsquo;s all.
      You&rsquo;ve been attracted to her because she was pretty and educated and&mdash;and
      sweet; and she&rsquo;s liked you because you were about the only young person
      who could understand her and&mdash;and all that. And so you&rsquo;ve been
      meetin&rsquo; and have come to believe&mdash;you have, anyway&mdash;that &lsquo;twas
      somethin&rsquo; more than likin&rsquo;. But you neither of you have stopped to think
      that a marriage between you two was as impossible as anything could be.
      And, besides, there&rsquo;s another man. A man she&rsquo;s known all her life and
      loved and respected&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Mrs. Coffin! stop this wicked nonsense. I won&rsquo;t hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, Grace Van Horne is goin&rsquo; to marry Cap&rsquo;n Nat Hammond. There! that&rsquo;s
      the livin&rsquo; truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his absolute confidence and faith he had again started for the door.
      Now he wheeled and stared at her. She nodded solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;She and Nat are promised to each other.
      Cap&rsquo;n Eben, on his deathbed, asked Dr. Parker and me to be witnesses to
      the engagement. Now you see why you mustn&rsquo;t go nigh her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer. Instead, he stood silently staring. She stepped forward
      and laid a hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set down, John,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Set down and let me tell you about it. Yes,
      yes, you must. If I tell you, you&rsquo;ll understand better. There! there!
      don&rsquo;t you interrupt me yet and don&rsquo;t you look that way. Do set down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led him over to the rocking-chair and gently forced him into it. He
      obeyed, although with no apparent realization of what he was doing. Still
      with her hand on his shoulder she went on speaking. She told him of her
      visit to the Hammond tavern, saying nothing of Mr. Pepper&rsquo;s call nor of
      her own experience in the grove. She told of Captain Eben&rsquo;s seizure, of
      what the doctor said, and of the old Come-Outer&rsquo;s return to consciousness.
      Then she described the scene in the sick room and how Nat and Grace had
      plighted troth. He listened, at first stunned and stolid, then with
      growing impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled; they&rsquo;re engaged, and Dr. Parker
      will tell everybody of the engagement this very mornin&rsquo;. It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any
      great surprise to me. Those two have been brought up together; &lsquo;twas the
      natural thing that was almost bound to happen. Eben&rsquo;s heart was set on it
      for years. And she&rsquo;ll have a good husband, John, that I know. And she&rsquo;ll
      do her best to make him happy. He&rsquo;s a good man and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good man!&rdquo; he cried furiously. &ldquo;A good man! One who will make use of a
      dying father to drive a girl into&mdash;Stand aside, Mrs. Coffin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, you mustn&rsquo;t speak that way of Nat Hammond. He ain&rsquo;t the kind to
      drive a girl against her will. And Grace is not one to be driven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you blind? Can&rsquo;t you see? Why, only yesterday, she&mdash;Do you think
      I shall permit such a wicked crime as that to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ss-sh! No, it ain&rsquo;t wicked, it&rsquo;s right. Right and best for everybody, for
      her especial. Yesterday she might have forgot for a minute. But think,
      just think what would have happened if she cared for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she does! I know she does. Mrs. Coffin, stand away from that door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, John; if you go out of that door now, to go to her, you&rsquo;ll have to go
      by main strength. You shan&rsquo;t wreck yourself and that girl if I can help
      it. Be a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair looked at each other. Keziah was determined, but so, evidently,
      was he. She realized, with a sinking heart, that her words had made
      absolutely no impression. He did not attempt to pass, but he slowly shook
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you believe you&rsquo;re doing right. I hope&mdash;yes,
      I&rsquo;ll give you credit for that belief. But I KNOW I am right and I shall go
      to her. Such a&mdash;a BARGAIN as that you have just told me of is no more
      to be regarded than&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, I beg you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go. Go this minute and break her heart and ruin her life and spoil
      her good name in this village where she&rsquo;s lived since she was eight years
      old. Go! be selfish. I suppose that&rsquo;s part of a man&rsquo;s make-up. Go! Never
      mind her. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do &lsquo;mind&rsquo; her, as you call it. I AM thinking of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not. It&rsquo;s yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was myself&mdash;and God knows it is the only happiness on earth
      for me&mdash;if it was only myself, and I really thought she wished me to
      stay away, I&rsquo;d stay, I&rsquo;d stay, though I&rsquo;d pray to die before this hour was
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know. I&rsquo;ve prayed to die myself afore now, but I&rsquo;m here yet;
      and so will you be. We can&rsquo;t die so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose SHE would come to YOU if she knew it would be your ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. The last time they met, ages before&mdash;no, only the
      previous afternoon&mdash;she had told him it was his happiness and his
      future only that she thought of. He choked and drew his hand across his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you tell me it will be her ruin. YOU tell me so.
      You SAY she doesn&rsquo;t want me. I tell you that the only thing that will keep
      me from her is hearing that from her own lips. When she tells me to leave
      her I will, and not before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tell you, John; she&rsquo;ll tell you. I know you must despise me,
      pretty nigh. I cal&rsquo;late you think I&rsquo;m a worldly old woman, carin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; 
      for your feelin&rsquo;s. Maybe I&rsquo;ve talked pretty hard in the last few minutes,
      but I haven&rsquo;t meant to be hard. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d listen
      to me. I expected you&rsquo;d insist on seein&rsquo; her yourself. Well, then, go and
      see her, if you must, though what will come of it can only be more
      trouble, for you run the risk of folks knowin&rsquo; it and beginnin&rsquo; to wonder.
      And I know Grace. She&rsquo;s made up her mind and won&rsquo;t change it. But I do ask
      you this: I ask you not to go now. Wait a little while, do. I left her
      asleep, worn out by what she&rsquo;s been through and under the effects of the
      doctor&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo; medicine. He said she must rest or he was afraid her
      brain would give out. For her sake, then, wait a little. Then, if you
      don&rsquo;t hear from her, maybe I can arrange a meetin&rsquo; place where you can see
      her without anyone&rsquo;s knowin&rsquo; it. I&rsquo;ll try. But do wait a little while, for
      her sake, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last he was listening and hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; begged Keziah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait. I&rsquo;ll wait until noon, somehow, if I
      can. I&rsquo;ll try. But not a minute later. Not one. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      asking, Mrs. Coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. I know well. And I thank you for her sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not have to wait until noon. At six o&rsquo;clock, through the
      dew-soaked grass of the yard, came the Higgins boy. For the first time in
      his short life he had been awake all night and he moved slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper opened the door. Ike held up an envelope, clutched in a
      grimy hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Mrs. Keziah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gracie, she sent it. There ain&rsquo;t no
      answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah took the letter. &ldquo;How is she? And how&rsquo;s Nat?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; pretty well, so ma says. Ma&rsquo;s there now and they&rsquo;ve sent
      for Hannah Poundberry. Gee!&rdquo; he added, yawning, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t slept a wink.
      Been on the jump, now I tell ye. Didn&rsquo;t none of them Come-Outers git in,
      not one. I sent &lsquo;em on the home tack abilin&rsquo;. You ought to hear me give
      old Zeke Bassett Hail Columby! Gosh! I was just ahopin&rsquo; HE&rsquo;D come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin closed the door and tore open the envelope. Within was another
      addressed, in Grace&rsquo;s handwriting, to Mr. Ellery. The housekeeper entered
      the study, handed it to him and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister, who had been pacing the floor, seized the note eagerly. It
      was written in pencil and by a hand that had trembled much. Yet there was
      no indecision in the written words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear John,&rdquo; wrote Grace. &ldquo;I presume Aunt Keziah has told you of uncle&rsquo;s
      death and of my promise to Nat. It is true. I am going to marry him. I am
      sure this is right and for the best. Our friendship was a mistake and you
      must not see me again. Please don&rsquo;t try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GRACE VAN HORNE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beneath was another paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I shall be happy, I am sure. And I shall hope that
      you may be. I shall pray for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note fell to the floor with a rustle that sounded loud in the
      stillness. Then Keziah heard the minister&rsquo;s step. She turned. He was
      moving slowly across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she cried anxiously, &ldquo;you poor boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered without looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;going&mdash;up&mdash;to&mdash;my&mdash;room,&rdquo; he said, a pause
      between each word. &ldquo;I want to be alone awhile, Mrs. Coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wearily Keziah set about preparing breakfast. Not that she expected the
      meal would be eaten, but it gave her something to do and occupied her
      mind. The sun had risen and the light streamed in at the parsonage
      windows. The breeze blew fresh and cool from the ocean. It was a
      magnificent morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called to him that breakfast was ready, but he did not answer. She
      could eat nothing herself, and, when the table was cleared, prepared to do
      the week&rsquo;s washing, for Monday is always washday in Trumet. Noon came,
      dinner time, but still he did not come down. At last Keziah could stand it
      no longer. She determined to go to him. She climbed the steep stairs and
      rapped on the door of his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, can I come in? I know you want to
      be alone, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d ought to be, too much. I&rsquo;d like to talk
      with you a few minutes; may I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment passed before he told her to enter. He was sitting in a chair by
      the window, dressed just as he had been when she returned from the tavern.
      She looked sharply at his face as it was turned toward her. His eyes were
      dry and in them was an expression so hopeless and dreary that the tears
      started to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to think of your facin&rsquo; it alone up
      here. I just had to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and the smile was as hopeless as the look in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Face it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Coffin, I must face it, I suppose.
      I&rsquo;ve been facing it ever since&mdash;since I knew. And I find it no
      easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, what are you goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go away somewhere, first of
      all, I guess. Go somewhere and&mdash;and try to live it down. I can&rsquo;t, of
      course, but I must try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away? Leave Trumet and your church and your congregation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you suppose I could stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see the same people and the same places? And do the same things? See&mdash;see
      HER! Did you&rdquo;&mdash;he moved impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;did you expect me to
      attend the wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put out her hand. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;ll be hard,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;stayin&rsquo; here, I
      mean. But your duty to others&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve heard enough about duty to others? How about my
      duty to myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the last thing we ought to think about in the world, if we
      do try to be fair and square. Your church thinks a heap of you, John. They
      build on you. You&rsquo;ve done more in the little while you&rsquo;ve been here than
      Mr. Langley did in his last fifteen years. We&rsquo;ve grown and we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; 
      good&mdash;doin&rsquo; it, not talkin&rsquo; it in prayer meetin&rsquo;. The parish
      committee likes you and the poor folks in the society love you. Old Mrs.
      Prince was tellin&rsquo; me, only a little spell ago, that she didn&rsquo;t know how
      she&rsquo;d have pulled through this dreadful time if &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for you. And
      there&rsquo;s lots of others. Are you goin&rsquo; to leave them? And what reason will
      you give for leavin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I may not give any. But I
      shall go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you will. I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re that kind. I&rsquo;ve watched
      you pretty sharp since you and I have been livin&rsquo; together and I have more
      faith in you than that comes to. You haven&rsquo;t acted to me like a coward and
      I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin, it is so easy for you to talk. Perhaps if I were in your
      place I should be giving good advice about duty and not running away and
      so on. But suppose you were in mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose&mdash;Oh, but there! it&rsquo;s past supposing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s &lsquo;tis. My life hasn&rsquo;t been all sunshine and fair winds, by
      no means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I beg your pardon. You have had troubles and, from what I
      hear, you&rsquo;ve borne them bravely. But you haven&rsquo;t had to face anything like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I? Well, what is it you&rsquo;re asked to face? Disappointment? I&rsquo;ve
      faced that. Sorrow and heartbreak? I&rsquo;ve faced them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been asked to sit quietly by and see the one you love more
      than all the world marry some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I ain&rsquo;t? How do you know I ain&rsquo;t doin&rsquo; just that now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Ellery, you listen to me. You think I&rsquo;m a homely old woman,
      probably, set in my ways as an eight-day clock. I guess I look like it and
      act like it. But I ain&rsquo;t so awful old&mdash;on the edge of forty, that&rsquo;s
      all. And when I was your age I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so awful homely, either. I had
      fellers aplenty hangin&rsquo; round and I could have married any one of a dozen.
      This ain&rsquo;t boastin&rsquo;; land knows I&rsquo;m fur from that. I was brought up in
      this town and even when I was a girl at school there was only one boy I
      cared two straws about. He and I went to picnics together and to parties
      and everywhere. Folks used to laugh and say we was keepin&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ny, even
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I was eighteen, after father died, I went up to New Bedford to
      work in a store there. Wanted to earn my own way. And this young feller
      I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you about went away to sea, but every time he come home from a
      voyage he come to see me and things went on that way till we was promised
      to each other. The engagement wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t announced, but &lsquo;twas so, just the
      same. We&rsquo;d have been married in another year. And then we quarreled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas a fool quarrel, same as that kind gen&rsquo;rally are. As much my fault
      as his and as much his as mine, I cal&rsquo;late. Anyhow, we was both proud, or
      thought we was, and neither would give in. And he says to me, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be
      sorry after I&rsquo;m gone. You&rsquo;ll wish me back then.&rsquo; And says I, BEIN&rsquo; a fool,
      &lsquo;I guess not. There&rsquo;s other fish in the sea.&rsquo; He sailed and I did wish him
      back, but I wouldn&rsquo;t write fust and neither would he. And then come
      another man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, hesitated, and then continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about the other man. He was handsome then, in a way, and he
      had money to spend, and he liked me. He wanted me to marry him. If&mdash;if
      the other, the one that went away, had written I never would have thought
      of such a thing, but he didn&rsquo;t write. And, my pride bein&rsquo; hurt, and all, I
      finally said yes to the second chap. My folks did all they could to stop
      it; they told me he was dissipated, they said he had a bad name, they told
      me twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a fit match. And his people, havin&rsquo; money, was just as set
      against his takin&rsquo; a poor girl. Both sides said ruin would come of it. But
      I married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the first year &lsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so bad. Not happiness exactly, but not
      misery either. That come later. His people was well off and he&rsquo;d never
      worked much of any. He did for a little while after we was married, but
      not for long. Then he begun to drink and carry on and lost his place.
      Pretty soon he begun to neglect me and at last went off to sea afore the
      mast. We was poor as poverty, but I could have stood that; I did stand it.
      I took in sewin&rsquo; and kept up an appearance, somehow. Never told a soul.
      His folks come patronizin&rsquo; around and offered me money, so&rsquo;s I needn&rsquo;t
      disgrace them. I sent &lsquo;em rightabout in a hurry. Once in a while he&rsquo;d come
      home, get tipsy and abuse me. Still I said nothin&rsquo;. Thank God, there was
      no children; that&rsquo;s the one thing I&rsquo;ve been thankful for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep such things quiet always. People are bound to find out.
      They come to me and said, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you leave him?&rsquo; but I wouldn&rsquo;t. I
      could have divorced him easy enough, there was reasons plenty, but I
      wouldn&rsquo;t do that. Then word came that he was dead, drowned off in the East
      Indies somewheres. I come back here to keep house for Sol, my brother, and
      I kept house for him till he died and they offered me this place here at
      the parsonage. There! that&rsquo;s my story, part of it, more&rsquo;n I ever told a
      livin&rsquo; soul afore, except Sol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased speaking. The minister, who had sat silent by the window,
      apathetically listening or trying to listen, turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I apologize, Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he said dully, &ldquo;you have had trials, hard
      ones. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they ain&rsquo;t as hard as yours, you think? Well, I haven&rsquo;t quite
      finished yet. After word come of my husband&rsquo;s death, the other man come
      and wanted me to marry him. And I wanted to&mdash;oh, how I wanted to! I
      cared as much for him as I ever did; more, I guess. But I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t, though it wrung my heart out to say no. I give him up&mdash;why?
      &lsquo;cause I thought I had a duty laid on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery sighed. &ldquo;I can see but one duty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is the duty given
      us by God, to marry the one we love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s agitation, which had grown as she told her story, suddenly
      flashed into flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that as fur as you can see?&rdquo; she asked fiercely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy duty,
      then&mdash;or looks easy now. I&rsquo;ve got a harder one; it&rsquo;s to stand by the
      promise I gave and the man I married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her as if he thought she had lost her wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man you married?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Why, the man you married is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t. You remember the letter you saw me readin&rsquo; that night when
      you come back from Come-Outers&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;? Well, that letter was from him.
      He&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time during the interview the minister rose to his feet,
      shocked out of his despair and apathy by this astounding revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alive?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Your husband ALIVE? Why, Mrs. Coffin, this is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved him to silence. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop me now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told so
      much; let me tell the rest. Yes, he&rsquo;s alive. Alive and knockin&rsquo; round the
      world somewheres. Every little while he writes me for money and, if I have
      any, I send it to him. Why? Why &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m a coward, after all, I guess,
      and I&rsquo;m scared he&rsquo;ll do what he says he will and come back. Perhaps you
      think I&rsquo;m a fool to put up with it; that&rsquo;s what most folks would say if
      they knew it. They&rsquo;d tell me I ought to divorce him. Well, I can&rsquo;t, I
      CAN&rsquo;T. I walked into the mess blindfold; I married him in spite of
      warnin&rsquo;s and everything. I took him for better or for worse, and now that
      he&rsquo;s turned out worse, I must take my medicine. I can&rsquo;t live with him&mdash;that
      I can&rsquo;t do&mdash;but while HE lives I&rsquo;ll stay his wife and give him what
      money I can spare. That&rsquo;s the duty I told you was laid on me, and it&rsquo;s a
      hard one, but I don&rsquo;t run away from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery was silent. What could he say? Keziah went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t run away from it,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and you mustn&rsquo;t run away from
      yours. Your church depends on you, they trust you. Are you goin&rsquo; to show
      &lsquo;em their trust was misplaced? The girl you wanted is to marry another
      man, that&rsquo;s true, and it&rsquo;s mighty hard. But she&rsquo;ll marry a good man, and,
      by and by, she&rsquo;ll be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; he said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, happy. I know she&rsquo;ll be happy because I know she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; what&rsquo;ll be
      best for her and because I know him that&rsquo;s to be her husband. I&rsquo;ve known
      him all my life; he&rsquo;s that other one that&mdash;that&mdash;and I give him
      up to her; yes, I give him up to her, and try to do it cheerful, because I
      know it&rsquo;s best for him. Hard for YOU? Great Lord A&rsquo;mighty! do you think it
      ain&rsquo;t hard for ME? I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short; then covering her face with her apron, she ran from the
      room. John Ellery heard her descending the stairs, sobbing as she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that afternoon he remained in his chair by the window. It was six
      o&rsquo;clock, supper time, when he entered the kitchen. Keziah, looking up from
      the ironing board, saw him. He was white and worn and grim, but he held
      out his hand to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going away. You&rsquo;ve shown me what devotion
      to duty really means. I shall stay here and go on with my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face lit up. &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought you would. I was sure
      you was that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE SEA MIST SAILS
    </h3>
    <p>
      They buried Captain Eben in the little Come-Outer cemetery at the rear of
      the chapel. A bleak, wind-swept spot was that cemetery, bare of trees and
      with only a few graves and fewer headstones, for the Come-Outers were a
      comparatively new sect and their graveyard was new in consequence. The
      grave was dug in the yellow sand beside that of Mrs. Hammond, Nat&rsquo;s
      mother, and around it gathered the fifty or sixty friends who had come to
      pay their last tribute to the old sailor and tavern keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Come-Outers were there, all of them, and some members of the Regular
      society, Captain Zeb Mayo, Dr. Parker, Keziah Coffin, Mrs. Higgins, and
      Ike. Mrs. Didama Rogers was there also, not as a mourner, but because, in
      her capacity as gatherer of gossip, she made it a point never to miss a
      funeral. The Rev. Absalom Gott, Come-Outer exhorter at Wellmouth, preached
      the short sermon, and Ezekiel Bassett added a few remarks. Then a hymn was
      sung and it was over. The little company filed out of the cemetery, and
      Captain Eben Hammond was but a memory in Trumet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah lingered to speak a word with Grace. The girl, looking very white
      and worn, leaned on the arm of Captain Nat, whose big body acted as a
      buffer between her and over-sympathetic Come-Outers. Mrs. Coffin silently
      held out both hands and Grace took them eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for coming, Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was sure you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Least I could do, deary,&rdquo; was the older woman&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Your uncle and I
      was good friends once; we haven&rsquo;t seen each other so often of late years,
      but that ain&rsquo;t changed my feelin&rsquo;s. Now you must go home and rest. Don&rsquo;t
      let any of these&rdquo;&mdash;with a rather scornful glance at Josiah Badger and
      Ezekiel and the Reverend Absalom&mdash;&ldquo;these Job&rsquo;s comforters bother you.
      Nat, you see that they let her alone, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nat nodded. He, too, looked very grave and worn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tend to
      them,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Come, Grace,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the girl hung back. &ldquo;Just a minute, Nat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;would
      you mind if I spoke to Aunt Keziah&mdash;alone? I only want to say a
      word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat strode off to the cemetery gate, where Josiah Badger stood,
      brandishing a red cotton handkerchief as a not too-clean emblem of
      mourning. Mr. Badger eagerly sprang forward, but ran into an impossible
      barrier in the form of the captain&rsquo;s outstretched arm. Josiah protested
      and the captain replied. Grace leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;tell me: Did a letter&mdash;Did he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it came. I gave it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did&mdash;did he tell you? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, deary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he&mdash;is he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s well, deary. He&rsquo;ll be all right. I&rsquo;ll look out for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will, won&rsquo;t you? You won&rsquo;t let him do anything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. Don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ve had a long talk and he&rsquo;s going to stay
      right here and go on with his work. And nobody else&rsquo;ll ever know, Gracie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;O Aunt Keziah! how he must despise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Despise you! For doin&rsquo; what was your duty? Nonsense! He&rsquo;ll respect you
      for it and come to understand &lsquo;twas best for both of you, by and by. Don&rsquo;t
      worry about him, Gracie. I tell you I&rsquo;ll look out for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it will be better if he does despise me. And hate me, too. He
      can&rsquo;t despise and hate me more than I do myself. But it IS right&mdash;what
      I&rsquo;m doing; and the other was wrong and wicked. Auntie, you&rsquo;ll come and see
      me, won&rsquo;t you? I shall be so lonesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; I&rsquo;ll come. Perhaps not right away. There&rsquo;s reasons why I&rsquo;d
      better not come right away. But, by and by, after it&rsquo;s all settled and you
      and Nat&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated for an instant in spite of herself&mdash;&ldquo;after
      you and Nat are married I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about that NOW. Please don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t. You be a good, brave girl and look out for Nat;
      that&rsquo;s your duty and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do it. And I&rsquo;ll do my best for John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call him John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. We had a sort of&mdash;of adoptin&rsquo; ceremony the other mornin&rsquo; and I&mdash;Well,
      you see, I&rsquo;ve got to have somebody to call by their front name and he&rsquo;s
      about all I&rsquo;ve got left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Aunt Keziah! if I could be one half as patient and brave and sweet as
      you are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sssh! here comes Nat. Be kind to him. He&rsquo;s sufferin&rsquo;, too; maybe more&rsquo;n
      you imagine. Here she is, Nat. Take her back home and be good to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broad-shouldered skipper led his charge out of the gate and down the
      &ldquo;Turn-off.&rdquo; Josiah Badger looked after them disgustedly. As Keziah
      approached, he turned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swan to man!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in offended indignation, &ldquo;if I ain&rsquo;t losin&rsquo; 
      my respect for that Nat Hammond. He&rsquo;s the f-f-fuf-for&rsquo;ardest critter ever
      I see. I was just agoin&rsquo; to hail Gracie and ask her what she thought about
      my leadin&rsquo; some of the meetin&rsquo;s now her uncle has been called aloft. I
      wanted to ask her about it fust, afore Zeke Bassett got ahead of me, but
      that Nat wouldn&rsquo;t let me. Told me she mustn&rsquo;t be b-b-b-bothered about
      little things now. LITTLE things! Now, what do you think of that, Mrs.
      Coffin? And I spoke to Lot Taylor, one of our own s-s-sas-sassiety, and
      asked what he thought of it, and he said for me to go home set d-d-down
      and let my h-h-h-hah-hair grow. Of all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what you do, Josiah,&rdquo; broke in the voice of Captain Zeb Mayo,
      &ldquo;you go home or somewhere else and set down and have it cut. That&rsquo;ll take
      pretty nigh as long, and&rsquo;ll keep it from wearin&rsquo; out your coat collar.
      Keziah, I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for you. Get in my shay and I&rsquo;ll drive you back
      to the parsonage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Coffin accepted the invitation and a seat in the chaise beside
      Captain Zeb. The captain spoke of the dead Come-Outer and of his respect
      for him in spite of the difference in creed. He also spoke of the Rev.
      John Ellery and of the affection he had come to feel for the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that young feller, Keziah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like him for a lot of
      reasons, same as the boy liked the hash. For one thing, his religion ain&rsquo;t
      all starch and no sugar. He&rsquo;s good-hearted and kind and&mdash;and human.
      He seems to get just as much satisfaction out of the promise of heaven as
      he does out of the sartainty of t&rsquo;other port. He ain&rsquo;t all the time
      bangin&rsquo; the bulkhead and sniffin&rsquo; brimstone, like parsons I have seen.
      Sulphur&rsquo;s all right for a spring medicine, maybe, but when June comes I
      like to remember that God made roses. Elkanah, he comes to me a while ago
      and he says, &lsquo;Zebedee,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s sermons
      might be more orthodox?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;they might be, but what a mercy
      &lsquo;tis they ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; He, he, he! I kind of like to poke Elkanah in the shirt
      front once in a while, just to hear it crackle. Say, Keziah, you don&rsquo;t
      think the minister and Annabel are&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the emphatic interruption; &ldquo;I know they ain&rsquo;t; he ain&rsquo;t,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Them Danielses cal&rsquo;late they own the most of this town already; if
      they owned the minister they&rsquo;d swell up so the rest of us would have to go
      aloft or overboard; we&rsquo;d be crowded off the decks, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one owns him. Haven&rsquo;t you found that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup, I cal&rsquo;late I have and I glory in his spunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say so. Of course Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah is boss of the
      parish committee and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? No, he ain&rsquo;t nuther. He&rsquo;s head of it, but his vote counts just one
      and no more. What makes you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nuthin&rsquo;. Only I thought maybe, long as Elkanah was feelin&rsquo; that Mr.
      Ellery wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t orthodox enough, he might be goin&rsquo; to make a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might? HE might! Say, Keziah Coffin, there was Mayos in this town and
      in this church afore the fust Daniels ever washed ashore; and they&rsquo;ll be
      here when the last one blows up with his own importance. I&rsquo;m on that
      parish committee&mdash;you understand?&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve sailed ships and
      handled crews. I ain&rsquo;t so old nor feeble but what I can swing a belayin&rsquo; 
      pin. Boss! I&rsquo;ll have you to know that no livin&rsquo; man bosses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! I didn&rsquo;t mean to stir you up, Zebedee. But from things Cap&rsquo;n
      Daniels has said I gathered that he was runnin&rsquo; the committee. And, as I&rsquo;m
      a friend of Mr. Ellery, it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend! Well, so&rsquo;m I, ain&rsquo;t I? If you ever hear of Daniels tryin&rsquo; any
      tricks against the minister, you send for me, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;LL show him.
      Boss! Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wily Keziah alighted at the parsonage gate with the feeling that she
      had sown seed in fertile ground. She was quite aware of Captain Zeb&rsquo;s
      jealousy of the great Daniels. And the time might come when her parson
      needed an influential friend on the committee and in the Regular society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the engagement between Captain Nat Hammond and Grace Van
      Horne, told by Dr. Parker to one or two of his patients, spread through
      Trumet like measles through a family of small children. Didama Rogers
      learned it, so did Lavinia Pepper, and after that it might as well have
      been printed on the walls for all to read. It was talked over and gossiped
      about in every household from the lighthouse keeper&rsquo;s family to that of
      George Washington Cash, who lived in the one-room hovel in the woods near
      the Wellmouth line, and was a person of distinction, in his way, being the
      sole negro in the county. And whenever it was discussed it was considered
      a fine thing for both parties concerned. Almost everyone said it was
      precisely what they expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel Daniels and her father had not expected it. They were, however,
      greatly pleased. In their discussion, which lasted far into the night,
      Captain Elkanah expressed the opinion that the unexpected denouement was
      the result of his interview with Eben. He had told the old Come-Outer what
      would happen to his ward if she persisted in her impudent and audacious
      plot to entrap a Regular clergyman. She, being discovered, had yielded,
      perforce, and had accepted Nat as the next best catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annabel was not satisfied with this explanation. Of course, she said, she
      did not pretend to believe Grace&rsquo;s statement that she had found her uncle
      unconscious. No doubt the pair had had an interview and all that. But she
      believed the minister himself had come to his senses and had dismissed the
      brazen creature. She did not blame Mr. Ellery so much. He was a young man,
      with a kind heart, and no doubt the &ldquo;Van Horne person&rdquo; had worked upon his
      sympathies and had taken advantage of his inexperience of feminine wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, pa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s our duty, yours and mine, to treat him
      just as we always have. He doesn&rsquo;t know that we know, and we will keep the
      secret. And, as Christians, we should forget and forgive. We&rsquo;ll invite him
      here as we always have, keep him under our good influence, and be very
      kind to him, poor innocent. As for Captain Hammond, I&rsquo;m sorry for him,
      knowing the kind of wife he is going to have, but no doubt Come-Outers are
      not particular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan Pepper was another whom the news of the engagement surprised greatly.
      When Lavinia told him of it, at the dinner table, he dropped the knife he
      was holding and the greasy section of fish-ball balanced upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bishy,&rdquo; said Miss Pepper, &ldquo;what do you s&rsquo;pose has happened down to the
      Hammond tavern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know that,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I heard that long ago; Cap&rsquo;n Eben&rsquo;s
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Course he&rsquo;s dead; and I knew you knew it. Land sakes! don&rsquo;t be such a
      ninny. Why, I told you myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know but you&rsquo;d forgot. Anybody&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble to forget who
      they&rsquo;ve told things to. Why, I&rsquo;ve forgot more things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there ain&rsquo;t no doubt about that. I&rsquo;ve told you a million times, if I
      have once, to tuck your napkin round your neck when you&rsquo;ve got your Sunday
      clothes on. And there you be this minute without a sign of a napkin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Laviny! I MUST have it round my neck. I know I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so foolish! Think I&rsquo;m blind? Can&rsquo;t I see you ain&rsquo;t got it? Now
      where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan began a futile hunt for the missing napkin, in his lap, on the table,
      and finally under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;where that napkin can be. I&rsquo;m just as
      sure I had it and now I&rsquo;m just as sure I ain&rsquo;t got it. What do you s&rsquo;pose
      I done with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows! &lsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if you&rsquo;d et it, you&rsquo;re that
      absent-minded. Here! what&rsquo;s that stickin&rsquo; out of your breast pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brother put his hand to the pocket indicated and produced the missing
      napkin, much crumpled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone of relief. &ldquo;Now I remember. It must have
      dropped on the floor and I thought &lsquo;twas my handkerchief and picked it up
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think you&rsquo;d be carryin&rsquo; a white handkerchief for, on a week
      day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had on my Sunday suit and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and for the dear mercy sakes WHY have you got it on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan saw an opportunity for self-justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You TOLD me to put it on,&rdquo; he declared triumphantly. &ldquo;You said yourself
      I&rsquo;d better rig out in my Sunday clothes &lsquo;cause we might go to Eben&rsquo;s
      funeral. You know you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear the man! And then, after you&rsquo;ve dressed up to go to his funeral, you
      pretend to believe I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to tell you he&rsquo;s dead. I never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what IS it, then? He ain&rsquo;t come to life, has he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Van Horne&rsquo;s engaged to be married, that&rsquo;s what it is. Look out! Oh,
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just here occurred the accident already described. Knife and fish ball
      descended upon the waistcoat belonging to the &ldquo;Sunday suit.&rdquo; Lavinia flew
      for warm water, ammonia, and a cloth, and the soiled waistcoat was
      industriously scrubbed. The cleansing process was accompanied by a lively
      tongue lashing, to which Kyan paid little attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Engaged?&rdquo; he kept repeating. &ldquo;Gracie Van Horne engaged? Engaged? En&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, you poll parrot! Dear! dear! dear! look at them spots. Yes,
      yes; don&rsquo;t say it again; she&rsquo;s engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve turned to an owl, I do believe. &lsquo;Hoo! hoo!&rsquo; She&rsquo;s engaged to
      Nat Hammond, that&rsquo;s who. Nothin&rsquo; very surprisin&rsquo; about that, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan made no answer. He rubbed his forehead, while his sister rubbed the
      grease spots. In jerky sentences she told of the engagement and how the
      news had reached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; faltered Abishai. &ldquo;She goin&rsquo; to marry Nat! Why, I
      can&rsquo;t understand. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think? See here! you ain&rsquo;t keepin&rsquo; anything from me, be
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was enthusiastically emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no, no!&rdquo; declared Kyan. &ldquo;Only I didn&rsquo;t know they was&mdash;was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did anybody else, but what of it? Folks don&rsquo;t usually advertise
      when they&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ny, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o. But it&rsquo;s gen&rsquo;rally found out. I know if I was keepin&rsquo; comp&rsquo;ny&mdash;or
      you was, La-viny&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His sister started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; she demanded, looking quickly up from her
      rubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, nothin&rsquo;. Only if I was&mdash;or you was, somebody&rsquo;d see somethin&rsquo; 
      suspicious and kind of drop a hint, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better for them if they &lsquo;tended to their own affairs,&rdquo; was the sharp
      answer. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got any patience with folks that&rsquo;s always talkin&rsquo; about
      their neighbor&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s. There! now you go out and stand alongside the
      cook stove till that wet place dries. Don&rsquo;t you move till &lsquo;TIS dry,
      neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So to the kitchen went Kyan, to stand, a sort of living clotheshorse,
      beside the hot range. But during the drying process he rubbed his forehead
      many times. Remembering what he had seen in the grove he could not
      understand; but he also remembered, even more vividly, what Keziah Coffin
      had promised to do if he ever breathed a word. And he vowed again that
      that word should not be breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death and funeral of Captain Eben furnished Trumet with a subject of
      conversation for a week or more. Then, at the sewing circle and at the
      store and after prayer meeting, both at the Regular meeting house and the
      Come-Outer chapel, speculation centered on the marriage of Nat and Grace.
      When was it to take place? Would the couple live at the old house and
      &ldquo;keep packet tavern&rdquo; or would the captain go to sea again, taking his
      bride with him? Various opinions, pro and con, were expressed by the
      speculators, but no one could answer authoritatively, because none knew
      except those most interested, and the latter would not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery heard the discussions at the sewing circle when, in company
      with some of the men of his congregation, he dropped in at these
      gatherings for tea after the sewing was over. He heard them at church,
      before and after the morning service, and when he made pastoral calls.
      People even asked his opinion, and when he changed the subject inferred,
      some of them, that he did not care about the doings of Come-Outers. Then
      they switched to inquiries concerning his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look awful peaked lately, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; said Didama Rogers. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you
      feelin&rsquo; well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister answered that he was as well as usual, or thought he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you ain&rsquo;t nuther,&rdquo; declared Didama. &ldquo;You look&rsquo;s if you was comin&rsquo; 
      down with a spell of somethin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t the only one that&rsquo;s noticed it.
      Why, Thankful Payne says to me only yesterday, &lsquo;Didama,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;the
      minister&rsquo;s got somethin&rsquo; on his mind and it&rsquo;s wearin&rsquo; of him out.&rsquo; You
      ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; on your mind, have you, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not, Mrs. Rogers. It&rsquo;s a beautiful afternoon, isn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! I knew you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t well. A beautiful afternoon, and it hotter&rsquo;n
      furyation and gettin&rsquo; ready to rain at that! Don&rsquo;t tell me! &lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t your
      mind, Mr. Ellery, it&rsquo;s your blood that&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; thin. My husband had a
      spell just like it a year or two afore he died, and the doctor said he
      needed rest and a change. Said he&rsquo;d ought to go away somewheres by
      himself. I put my foot down on THAT in a hurry. &lsquo;The idea!&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;You,
      a sick man, goin&rsquo; off all alone by yourself to die of lonesomeness. If you
      go, I go with you.&rsquo; So him and me went up to Boston and it rained the
      whole week we was there, and we set in a little box of a hotel room with a
      window that looked out at a brick wall, and set and set and set, and
      that&rsquo;s all. I kept talkin&rsquo; to him to cheer him up, but he never cheered.
      I&rsquo;d talk to him for an hour steady and when I&rsquo;d stop and ask a question
      he&rsquo;d only groan and say yes, when he meant no. Finally, I got disgusted,
      after I&rsquo;d asked him somethin&rsquo; four or five times and he&rsquo;d never answered,
      and I told him, I believed he was gettin&rsquo; deef. &lsquo;Lordy!&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I wish
      I was!&rsquo; Well, that was enough for ME. Says I, &lsquo;If your mind&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      give out we&rsquo;d better be home.&rsquo; So home we come. And that&rsquo;s all the good
      change and rest done HIM. Hey? What did you say, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;oh, nothing, nothing, Mrs. Rogers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. So home we come and I&rsquo;d had enough of doctors to last. I figgered
      out that his blood was thinnin&rsquo; and I knew what was good for that. My
      great Aunt Hepsy, that lived over to East Wellmouth, she was a great hand
      for herbs and such and she&rsquo;d give me a receipt for thickenin&rsquo; the blood
      that was somethin&rsquo; wonderful. It had more kind of healin&rsquo; herbs in it than
      you could shake a stick at. I cooked a kittleful and got him to take a
      dose four times a day. He made more fuss than a young one about takin&rsquo; it.
      Said it tasted like the Evil One, and such profane talk, and that it stuck
      to his mouth so&rsquo;s he couldn&rsquo;t relish his vittles; but I never let up a
      mite. He had to take it and it done him a world of good. Now I&rsquo;ve got that
      receipt yet, Mr. Ellery, and I&rsquo;ll make some of that medicine for you. I&rsquo;ll
      fetch it down to-morrow. Yes, yes, I will. I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to, so you needn&rsquo;t
      say no. And perhaps I&rsquo;ll have heard somethin&rsquo; about Cap&rsquo;n Nat and Grace by
      that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brought the medicine, and the minister promptly, on her departure,
      handed it over to Keziah, who disposed of it just as promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I do with it?&rdquo; repeated the housekeeper. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you. I
      was kind of curious to see what &lsquo;twas like, so I took a teaspoonful. I did
      intend to pour the rest of it out in the henyard, but after that taste I
      had too much regard for the hens. So I carried it way down to the pond and
      threw it in, jug and all. B-r-r-r! Of all the messes that&mdash;I used to
      wonder what made Josh Rogers go moonin&rsquo; round makin&rsquo; his lips go as if he
      was crazy. I thought he was talkin&rsquo; to himself, but now I know better, he
      was TASTIN&rsquo;. B-r-r-r!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was the life of the gloomy parsonage. Without her the minister
      would have broken down. Time and time again he was tempted to give up, in
      spite of his promise, and leave Trumet, but her pluck and courage made him
      ashamed of himself and he stayed to fight it out. She watched him and
      tended him and &ldquo;babied&rdquo; him as if he was a spoiled child, pretending to
      laugh at herself for doing it and at him for permitting it. She cooked the
      dishes he liked best, she mended his clothes, she acted as a buffer
      between him and callers who came at inopportune times. She was cheerful
      always when he was about, and no one would have surmised that she had a
      sorrow in the world. But Ellery knew and she knew he knew, so the
      affection and mutual esteem between the two deepened. He called her &ldquo;Aunt
      Keziah&rdquo; at her request and she continued to call him &ldquo;John.&rdquo; This was in
      private, of course; in public he was &ldquo;Mr. Ellery&rdquo; and she &ldquo;Mrs. Coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his walks about town he saw nothing of Grace. She and Mrs. Poundberry
      and Captain Nat were still at the old home and no one save themselves knew
      what their plans might be. Yet, oddly enough, Ellery was the first
      outsider to learn these plans and that from Nat himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met the captain at the corner of the &ldquo;Turnoff&rdquo; one day late in August.
      He tried to make his bow seem cordial, but was painfully aware that it was
      not. Nat, however, seemed not to notice, but crossed the road and held out
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t run across you for
      sometime. What&rsquo;s the matter? Seems to me you look rather under the
      weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery answered that he was all right and, remembering that he had not met
      the captain since old Hammond&rsquo;s death, briefly expressed his sympathy. His
      words were perfunctory and his manner cold. His reason told him that this
      man was not to blame&mdash;was rather to be pitied, if Keziah&rsquo;s tale was
      true. Yet it is hard to pity the one who is to marry the girl you love.
      Reason has little to do with such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; said Captain Nat, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t keep you. I see you&rsquo;re in a
      hurry. Just thought I&rsquo;d run alongside a minute and say good-by. Don&rsquo;t
      know&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll see you again afore I sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you sail? You&mdash;you are going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. My owners have been after me for a good while, but I wouldn&rsquo;t leave
      home on account of dad&rsquo;s health. Now he&rsquo;s gone, I&rsquo;ve got to be gettin&rsquo; 
      back on salt water again. My ship&rsquo;s been drydocked and overhauled and
      she&rsquo;s in New York now loadin&rsquo; for Manila. It&rsquo;s a long vy&rsquo;age, even if I
      come back direct, which ain&rsquo;t likely. So I may not see the old town again
      for a couple of years. Take care of yourself, won&rsquo;t you? Good men,
      especially ministers, are scurse, and from what I hear about you I
      cal&rsquo;late Trumet needs you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last of next week, most likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you&mdash;shall you go alone? Are you to be&mdash;to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married? No. Grace and I have talked it over and we&rsquo;ve agreed it&rsquo;s best
      to wait till I come back. You see, dad&rsquo;s been dead such a little while,
      and all, that&mdash;well, we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to wait, anyhow. She&rsquo;ll stay in the
      old house with Hannah, and I&rsquo;ve fixed things so she&rsquo;ll be provided for
      while I&rsquo;m gone. I left it pretty much to her. If she&rsquo;d thought it best for
      us to marry now, I cal&rsquo;late I should have&mdash;have&mdash;well, done what
      she wanted. But she didn&rsquo;t. Ah, hum!&rdquo; he added with a sigh; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a good
      girl, a mighty good girl. Well, so long and good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by. Er&mdash;I say, Mr. Ellery, how things at the parsonage? All
      well there, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Keziah&mdash;Mrs. Coffin, your housekeeper, is she smart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Say, you might tell her good-by for me, if you want to. Tell
      her I wished her all the luck there was. And&mdash;and&mdash;just say that
      there ain&rsquo;t any&mdash;well, that her friend&mdash;say just that, will you?&mdash;her
      FRIEND said &lsquo;twas all right. She&rsquo;ll understand; it&rsquo;s a&mdash;a sort of
      joke between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, captain; I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged. And just ask her to keep an eye on Grace while I&rsquo;m gone.
      Tell her I leave Gracie under her wing. Keziah and me are old chums, in a
      way, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll tell her that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t forget the &lsquo;friend&rsquo; part. Well, so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Didama and her fellow news-venders distributed the tale of Captain Nat&rsquo;s
      sailing broadcast during the next few days. There was much wonderment at
      the delayed marriage, but the general verdict was that Captain Eben&rsquo;s
      recent death and the proper respect due to it furnished sufficient excuse.
      Hannah Poundberry, delighted at being so close to the center of interest,
      talked and talked, and thus Grace was spared the interviews which would
      have been a trouble to her. Nat left town, via the packet, on the
      following Wednesday. Within another week came the news that his ship, the
      Sea Mist, had sailed from New York, bound for Manila. Her topsails sank
      beneath the horizon, and she vanished upon the wild waste of tumbling
      waves and out of Trumet&rsquo;s knowledge, as many another vessel, manned and
      officered by Cape Cod men, had done. The village talked of her and her
      commander for a few days and then forgot them both. Only at the old home
      by the landing and at the parsonage were they remembered.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH TRUMET TALKS OF CAPTAIN NAT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Summer was over, autumn came, passed, and it was winter&mdash;John
      Ellery&rsquo;s first winter in Trumet. Fish weirs were taken up, the bay filled
      with ice, the packet ceased to run, and the village settled down to
      hibernate until spring. The stage came through on its regular trips,
      except when snow or slush rendered the roads impassable, but passengers
      were very few. Occasionally there were northeast gales, with shrieking
      winds, driving gusts of sleet and hail and a surf along the ocean side
      that bellowed and roared and tore the sandy beach into new shapes, washing
      away shoals and building others, blocking the mouth of the little inlet
      where the fish boats anchored and opening a new channel a hundred yards
      farther down. Twice there were wrecks, one of a fishing schooner, the crew
      of which were fortunate enough to escape by taking to the dories, and
      another, a British bark, which struck on the farthest bar and was beaten
      to pieces by the great waves, while the townspeople stood helplessly
      watching from the shore, for launching a boat in that surf was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister was one of those who watched. News of the disaster had been
      brought to the village by the lightkeeper&rsquo;s assistant, and Ellery and most
      of the able-bodied men in town had tramped the three miles to the beach,
      facing the screaming wind and the cutting blasts of flying sand. As they
      came over the dunes there were times when they had to dig their heels into
      the ground and bend forward to stand against the freezing gale. And, as
      they drew nearer, the thunder of the mighty surf grew ever louder, until
      they saw the white clouds of spray leap high above the crazily tossing,
      flapping bunches of beach grass that topped the last knoll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three masts and a broken bowsprit sticking slantwise up from a whirl of
      creamy white, that was all they could see of the bark, at first glance.
      But occasionally, as the breakers drew back for another cruel blow, they
      caught glimpses of the tilted deck, smashed bare of houses and rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those black things on the masts?&rdquo; asked Ellery, bending to scream the
      question into the ear of Gaius Winslow, his companion. &ldquo;Are they&mdash;it
      can&rsquo;t be possible that they&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; shrieked Gaius in reply, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re men. Crew lashed in the riggin&rsquo;.
      Poor fellers! it&rsquo;ll soon be over for &lsquo;em. And they&rsquo;re most likely frozen
      stiff a&rsquo;ready and won&rsquo;t sense drownin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s a comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men!&rdquo; repeated the minister in horror. &ldquo;Men! Great God! and are we to
      stand by here and see them die without lifting a hand? Why, it&rsquo;s
      barbarous! It&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winslow seized his arm and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Look at them! How much good would our liftin&rsquo; hands
      do against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery looked. The undertow, that second, was sucking the beach dry,
      sucking with such force that gravel and small stones pattered down the
      slope in showers. And behind it a wave, its ragged top raveled by the wind
      into white streamers, was piling up, up, up, sheer and green and mighty,
      curling over now and descending with a hammer blow that shook the land
      beneath their feet. And back of it reared another, and another, and
      another, an eighth of a mile of whirling, surging, terrific breakers, with
      a yelling hurricane whipping them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was soon over, as Gaius had said it would be. A mighty leap of spray, a
      section of hull broken off and tossed into view for an instant, then two
      of the masts went down. The other followed almost at once. Then the
      watchers, most of them, went back to the village, saying little or nothing
      and dispersing silently to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next fortnight John Ellery conducted six funeral services,
      brief prayers beside the graves of unknown men from that wreck. The
      bodies, as they were washed ashore, were put into plain coffins paid for
      by the board of selectmen, and buried in the corner of the Regular
      cemetery beside other waifs thrown up by the sea in other years. It was a
      sad experience for him, but it was an experience and tended to make him
      forget his own sorrow just a little. Or, if not to forget, at least to
      think of and sympathize more keenly with the sorrows of others. Somewhere,
      in England or Ireland or scattered over the wide world, there were women
      and children waiting for these men, waiting anxiously for news of their
      safe arrival in port, praying for them. When he mentioned this thought to
      the townspeople they nodded philosophically and said yes, they &ldquo;presumed
      likely.&rdquo; As Captain Zeb put it, &ldquo;Most sailors are fools enough to get
      married, prob&rsquo;ly this lot wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t any exception.&rdquo; It was no new thought to
      him or to any other dweller in that region. It was almost a fixed
      certainty that, if you went to sea long enough, you were bound to be
      wrecked sometime or other. The chances were that, with ordinary luck and
      good management, you would escape with your life. Luck, good or bad, was
      the risk of the trade; good management was expected, as a matter of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper made no more calls at the parsonage, and when the minister met
      him, at church or elsewhere, seemed anxious to avoid an interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Abishai,&rdquo; asked Ellery, on one of these occasions, &ldquo;how are you
      getting on at home? Has your sister locked you up again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Kyan. &ldquo;Laviny, she&rsquo;s sort of diff&rsquo;rent
      lately. She ain&rsquo;t nigh so&mdash;so down on a feller as she used to be. I
      can get out once in a while by myself nowadays, when she wants to write a
      letter or somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s writing letters, is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm. Writes one about every once in a week. I don&rsquo;t know who
      they&rsquo;re to, nuther, but I have my suspicions. You see, we&rsquo;ve got a cousin
      out West&mdash;out Pennsylvany way&mdash;and he ain&rsquo;t very well and has
      got a turrible lot of money. I&rsquo;m sort of surmisin&rsquo; that Laviny&rsquo;s writin&rsquo; 
      to him. We&rsquo;re about his only relations that&rsquo;s left alive and&mdash;and so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; The minister smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. Laviny&rsquo;s a pretty good navigator, fur&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; an eye to wind&rsquo;ard
      is concerned. She was awful down on Phineas&mdash;that&rsquo;s his name&mdash;&lsquo;cause
      he married a Philadelphy woman, but he&rsquo;s a widower man now, so I s&rsquo;pose
      she feels better toward him. She&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; of goin&rsquo; up to Sandwich pretty
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She IS? Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave you here? Why! well, I&rsquo;m surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfreys mighty! so be I. But she says she b&rsquo;lieves she needs a change
      and there&rsquo;s church conference up there, you know, and she figgers that she
      ain&rsquo;t been to conference she don&rsquo;t know when. I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll go, won&rsquo;t
      you, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm. I kind of wisht I was goin&rsquo; myself. &lsquo;Twill be kind of
      lonesome round home without her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Considering that that variety of lonesomeness had been Abishai&rsquo;s dream of
      paradise for years, Ellery thought his change of heart a good joke and
      told Keziah of it when he returned to the parsonage. The housekeeper was
      greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! well! well!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Miracles&rsquo;ll never cease. I don&rsquo;t
      wonder so much at Laviny wantin&rsquo; to go to conference, but her darin&rsquo; to go
      and leave Kyan at home is past belief. Why, every time she&rsquo;s had a cold
      her one fear was that she&rsquo;d die and leave &lsquo;Bish behind to be kidnaped by
      some woman. Kyan himself was sick once, and the story was that his sister
      set side of the bed night and day and read him over and over again that
      chapter in the Bible that says there&rsquo;s no marryin&rsquo; or givin&rsquo; in marriage
      in heaven. Dr. Parker told me that he didn&rsquo;t believe &lsquo;Bish got ha&rsquo;f the
      comfort out of that passage that she did. And now she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to Sandwich
      and leave him. I can&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was true, and Lavinia got herself elected a delegate and went, in
      company with Captain Elkanah, Mrs. Mayo, and others, to the conference.
      She was a faithful attendant at the meetings and seemed to be having a
      very good time. She introduced the minister to one Caleb Pratt, a resident
      of Sandwich, whom she said she had known ever since she was a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pratt&rsquo;s a cousin to Thankful Payne over to home,&rdquo; volunteered
      Lavinia. &ldquo;You know Thankful, Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery did know Mrs. Payne and said so. Mr. Pratt, who was dressed in a
      new suit of black which appeared to hurt him, imparted the information
      that he&rsquo;d heard tell consider&rsquo;ble of Mr. Ellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I enjoyed your sermon to-night fust&mdash;rate,&rdquo; he added solemnly. &ldquo;Fust&mdash;rate,
      sir&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, indeed? I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. You used words in that sermon that I never heard afore in my
      life. &lsquo;Twas grand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia confided to her pastor that Mr. Pratt made the best shoes in
      Ostable County. He could fit ANY kind of feet, she declared, and the
      minister ought to try him sometime. She added that he had money in the
      bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend John rode home in the stage beside Miss Annabel, not from
      choice, but because the young lady&rsquo;s father insisted upon it. Miss Daniels
      gushed and enthused as she always did. As they drove by the Corners the
      minister, who had been replying absently to Annabel&rsquo;s questions, suddenly
      stopped short in the middle of a sentence. His companion, leaning forward
      to look out of the window, saw Grace Van Horne entering the store. For an
      instant Annabel&rsquo;s face wore a very unpleasant expression. Then she smiled
      and said, in her sweetest manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s the tavern girl! I haven&rsquo;t seen her for sometime. How old
      she looks! I suppose her uncle&rsquo;s death has aged her. Well, she&rsquo;ll be
      married soon, just as soon as Cap&rsquo;n Nat gets back. They perfectly worship
      each other, those two. They say she writes him the longest letters. Hannah
      Poundberry told me. Hannah&rsquo;s a queer creature and common, but devoted to
      the Hammonds, Mr. Ellery. However, you&rsquo;re not interested in Come-Outers,
      are you? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery made some sort of an answer, but he could not have told what it
      was. The sight of Grace had brought back all that he was trying so hard to
      forget. Why couldn&rsquo;t one forget, when it was so painful&mdash;and so
      useless&mdash;to remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring once more; then summer. And now people were again speaking of
      Captain Nat Hammond. His ship was overdue, long overdue. Even in those
      days, when there were no cables and the telegraph was still something of a
      novelty, word of his arrival should have reached Trumet months before
      this. But it had not come, and did not. Before the summer was over, the
      wise heads of the retired skippers were shaking dubiously. Something had
      happened to the Sea Mist, something serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the weeks and months went by without news of the missing vessel, this
      belief became almost a certainty. At the Come-Outer chapel, where Ezekiel
      Bassett now presided, prayers were offered for the son of their former
      leader. These prayers were not as fervent as they might have been, for
      Grace&rsquo;s nonattendance at meetings was causing much comment and a good deal
      of resentment. She came occasionally, but not often. &ldquo;I always said she
      was stuck-up and thought she was too good for the rest of us,&rdquo; remarked
      &ldquo;Sukey B.&rdquo; spitefully. &ldquo;&lsquo;And, between you and me, pa says he thinks Nat
      Hammond would be one to uphold her in it. He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bit spirituous and
      never experienced religion. If anything HAS happened to him, it&rsquo;s a
      punishment sent, that&rsquo;s what pa thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were gloomy days at the parsonage. Keziah said little concerning the
      topic of which all the village was talking, and John Ellery forebore to
      mention it. The housekeeper was as faithful as ever in the performance of
      her household duties, but her smile had gone and she was worn and anxious.
      The minister longed to express his sympathy, but Keziah had not mentioned
      Nat&rsquo;s name for months, not since he, Ellery, gave her the message
      intrusted to him by the captain before sailing. He would have liked to ask
      about Grace, for he knew Mrs. Coffin visited the Hammond home
      occasionally, but this, too, he hesitated to do. He heard from others that
      the girl was bearing the suspense bravely, that she refused to give up
      hope, and was winning the respect of all the thinking class in Trumet by
      her courage and patience. Even the most bigoted of the Regulars, Captain
      Daniels and his daughter excepted of course, had come to speak highly of
      her. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a spunky girl,&rdquo; declared Captain Zeb, with emphasis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      nothing of the milk-sop and cry-baby about her. She&rsquo;s fit to be a sailor&rsquo;s
      wife, and I only hope Nat&rsquo;s alive to come back and marry her. He was a
      durn good feller, too&mdash;savin&rsquo; your presence, Mr. Ellery&mdash;and if
      he was forty times a Come-Outer I&rsquo;d say the same thing. I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid he&rsquo;s
      gone, though, poor chap. As good a seaman as he was would have fetched
      port afore this if he was atop of water. As for Gracie, she&rsquo;s a brick, and
      a lady, every inch of her. My old girl went down t&rsquo;other day to call on
      her and that&rsquo;s the fust Come-Outer she&rsquo;s been to see sence there was any.
      Why don&rsquo;t you go see her, too, Mr. Ellery? &lsquo;Twould be a welcome change
      from Zeke Bassett and his tribe. Go ahead! it would be the Almighty&rsquo;s own
      work and the society&rsquo;d stand back of you, all them that&rsquo;s wuth
      considerin&rsquo;, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was surprising advice from a member of the Regular and was indicative
      of the changed feeling in the community, but the minister, of course,
      could not take it. He had plunged headlong into his church work, hoping
      that it and time would dull the pain of his terrible shock and
      disappointment. It had been dulled somewhat, but it was still there, and
      every mention of her name revived it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Keziah came into his study, where he was laboring with his
      next Sunday sermon, and sat down in the rocking-chair. She had been out
      and still wore her bonnet and shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I ask your pardon for disturbin&rsquo; you. I know you&rsquo;re
      busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery laid down his pen. &ldquo;Never too busy to talk with you, Aunt Keziah,&rdquo;
       he observed. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask if you knew Mrs. Prince was sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Is she? I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. Nothing serious, I hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not. Only she&rsquo;s got a cold and is kind of under the weather.
      I thought p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d like to run up and see her. She thinks the world
      and all of you, &lsquo;cause you was so good when she was distressed about her
      son. Poor old thing! she&rsquo;s had a hard time of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go. I ought to go, of course. I&rsquo;m glad you reminded me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I told her you hadn&rsquo;t meant to neglect her, but you&rsquo;d been busy
      fussin&rsquo; with the fair and the like of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was all. I&rsquo;ll go right away. Have you been there to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I just heard that she was ailin&rsquo; from Didama Rogers. Didama said she
      was all but dyin&rsquo;, so I knew she prob&rsquo;ly had a little cold, or somethin&rsquo;.
      If she was really very bad, Di would have had her buried by this time,
      so&rsquo;s to be sure her news was ahead of anybody else&rsquo;s. I ain&rsquo;t been up
      there, but I met her t&rsquo;other mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didama?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mrs. Prince. She&rsquo;d come down to see Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The old lady&rsquo;s been awful kind and sympathizin&rsquo; since&mdash;since
      this new trouble. It reminds her of the loss of her own boy, I presume
      likely, and so she feels for Grace. John, what do they say around town
      about&mdash;about HIM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hammond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister hesitated. Keziah did not wait for him to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Do they all feel that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, if you mean that they&rsquo;ve all given up hope, I should hardly say
      that. Captain Mayo and Captain Daniels were speaking of it in my hearing
      the other day and they agreed that there was still a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty slim one, though, they cal&rsquo;lated, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they were&mdash;were doubtful, of course. There was the possibility
      that he had been wrecked somewhere and hadn&rsquo;t been picked up. They cited
      several such cases. The South Pacific is full of islands where vessels
      seldom touch, and he and his crew may be on one of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They might, but I&rsquo;m afraid not. Ah, hum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and was turning away. Ellery rose also and laid his hand on her
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. I respected Captain Hammond, in
      spite of&mdash;of&mdash;in spite of everything. I&rsquo;ve tried to realize that
      he was not to blame. He was a good man and I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that he
      saved my life that morning on the flats. And I&rsquo;m so sorry for YOU.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she answered, with a sigh, &ldquo;sometimes I think you&rsquo;d better get
      another housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Are you going to leave me? YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be because I wanted to. But it seems almost as if there
      was a kind of fate hangin&rsquo; over me and that,&rdquo; she smiled faintly, &ldquo;as if
      &lsquo;twas sort of catchin&rsquo;, as you might say. Everybody I ever cared for has
      had somethin&rsquo; happen to &lsquo;em. My brother died; my&mdash;the man I married
      went to the dogs; then you and Grace had to be miserable and I had to help
      make you so; I sent Nat away and he blamed me and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. He didn&rsquo;t blame you. He sent you word that he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but he did, all the same. He must have. I should if I&rsquo;d been in his
      place. And now he&rsquo;s dead, and won&rsquo;t ever understand&mdash;on this earth,
      anyhow. I guess I&rsquo;d better clear out and leave you afore I spoil your
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah, you&rsquo;re my anchor to windward, as they say down here. If I
      lost you, goodness knows where I should drift. Don&rsquo;t you ever talk of
      leaving me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, John. I&rsquo;m glad you want me to stay. I won&rsquo;t leave yet awhile;
      never&mdash;unless I have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you ever have to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Yes, I do know, too. John, I had another letter
      t&rsquo;other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? From&mdash;from that man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup, from&mdash;&rdquo; For a moment it seemed as if she were about to
      pronounce her husband&rsquo;s name, something she had never done in his
      presence; but if she thought of it, she changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wanted money, of course; he always does. But
      that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the worst. The letter was from England, and in it he wrote
      that he was gettin&rsquo; sick of knockin&rsquo; around and guessed he&rsquo;d be for comin&rsquo; 
      to the States pretty soon and huntin&rsquo; me up. Said what was the use of
      havin&rsquo; an able-bodied wife if she couldn&rsquo;t give her husband a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know what he is, maybe full as well as you do. That&rsquo;s why I spoke
      of leavin&rsquo; you. If that man comes to Trumet, I&rsquo;ll go, sure as death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Aunt Keziah, you must free yourself from him. No power on earth
      can compel you to longer support such a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None on earth, no. But it&rsquo;s my punishment and I&rsquo;ve got to put up with it.
      I married him with my eyes wide open, done it to spite the&mdash;the
      other, as much as anything, and I must bear the burden. But I tell you
      this, John: if he comes here, to this town, where I&rsquo;ve been respected and
      considered a decent woman, if he comes here, I go&mdash;somewhere,
      anywhere that&rsquo;ll be out of the sight of them that know me. And wherever I
      go he shan&rsquo;t be with me. THAT I won&rsquo;t stand! I&rsquo;d rather die, and I hope I
      do. Don&rsquo;t talk to me any more now&mdash;don&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried out of the room. Later, as the minister passed through the
      dining room on his way to the door, she spoke to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say what I meant to when I broke in on you
      just now. I meant to tell you about Grace. I knew you&rsquo;d like to know and
      wouldn&rsquo;t ask. She&rsquo;s bearin&rsquo; up well, poor girl. She thought the world of
      Nat, even though she might not have loved him in the way that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What are you saying, Aunt Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;well, I mean that he&rsquo;d always been like an own brother to
      her and she cared a lot for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said she didn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? That was a slip of the tongue, maybe. But she bears it well and I
      don&rsquo;t think she gives up hope. I try not to, for her sake, and I try not
      to show her how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sewed vigorously for a few moments. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away, Gracie is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stay with a relation of the Hammonds over in
      Connecticut for a spell. I coaxed her into it. Stayin&rsquo; here at home with
      all this suspense and with Hannah Poundberry&rsquo;s tongue droppin&rsquo; 
      lamentations like kernels out of a corn sheller, is enough to kill a
      healthy batch of kittens with nine lives apiece. She didn&rsquo;t want to go;
      felt that she must stay here and wait for news; but I told her we&rsquo;d get
      news to her as soon as it come, and she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery took his hat from the peg and opened the door. His foot was on the
      step when Keziah spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;it don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;, John, except that she ain&rsquo;t so
      hard-hearted as maybe you might think&mdash;she&rsquo;s asked me about you &lsquo;most
      every time I&rsquo;ve been there. She told me to take good care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door closed. Keziah put down her sewing and listened as the minister&rsquo;s
      step sounded on the walk. She rose, went to the window and looked after
      him. She was wondering if she had made a mistake in mentioning Grace&rsquo;s
      name. She had meant to cheer him with the thought that he was not entirely
      forgotten, that he was, at least, pitied; but perhaps it would have been
      better to have remained silent. Her gaze shifted and she looked out over
      the bay, blue and white in the sun and wind. When she was a girl the sea
      had been kind to her, it had brought her father home safe, and those
      homecomings were her pleasantest memories. But she now hated it. It was
      cruel and cold and wicked. It had taken the man she loved and would have
      loved till she died, even though he could never have been hers, and she
      had given him to another; it had taken him, killed him cruelly, perhaps.
      And now it might be bringing to her the one who was responsible for all
      her sorrow, the one she could not think of without a shudder. She clung to
      the window sash and prayed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord! Lord!&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put any more on me now. I couldn&rsquo;t stand
      it! I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery, too, was thinking deeply as he walked up the main road on his way
      to Mrs. Prince&rsquo;s. Keziah&rsquo;s words were repeating themselves over and over
      in his brain. She had asked about him. She had not forgotten him
      altogether. And what did the housekeeper mean by saying that she had not
      loved Captain Hammond in the way that&mdash;Not that it could make any
      difference. Nothing could give him back his happiness. But what did it
      mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Prince was very glad to see him. He found her in the big armchair
      with the quilted back and the projecting &ldquo;wings&rdquo; at each side of her head.
      She was wrapped in a &ldquo;Rising Sun&rdquo; quilt which was a patchwork glory of red
      and crimson. A young girl, a neighbor, who was apparently acting in the
      dual capacity of nurse and housekeeper, admitted him to the old lady&rsquo;s
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; she exclaimed delightedly. &ldquo;Then you ain&rsquo;t forgot me
      altogether. I&rsquo;m awful glad to see you. You&rsquo;ll excuse me for not gettin&rsquo; 
      up; my back&rsquo;s got more pains in it than there is bones, a good sight. Dr.
      Parker says it&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; serious, and all I had to do was set still and
      take his medicine. I told him that either the aches or the medicine made
      settin&rsquo; still serious enough, and when your only amusement is listenin&rsquo; to
      Emeline Berry&mdash;she&rsquo;s the girl that&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; care of me&mdash;when
      your only fun is listenin&rsquo; to Emeline drop your best dishes in the kitchen
      sink, it&rsquo;s pretty nigh tragic. There! there! don&rsquo;t mind an old woman, Mr.
      Ellery. Set down and let&rsquo;s talk. It&rsquo;s a comfort to be able to say
      somethin&rsquo; besides &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t, Emeline!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Be sure you pick up all the
      pieces!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Prince&rsquo;s good spirits were of short duration. Her conversation soon
      shifted to the loss of her son and she wept, using the corner of the quilt
      to wipe away her tears. &ldquo;Eddie&rdquo; had been her idol and, as she said, it was
      hard to believe what folks kept tellin&rsquo; her, that it was God&rsquo;s will, and
      therefore all for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so easy to say,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Maybe it is best for the Lord, but
      how about me? I needed him more than they did up there, or I think I did.
      O Mr. Ellery, I don&rsquo;t mean to be irreverent, but WHY was it all for the
      best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Questions like this are hard to answer. The young minister tried, but the
      answers were unsatisfactory, even to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s Nat Hammond,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Prince. &ldquo;A fine man&mdash;no
      better anywhere, even though his father was a Come-Outer&mdash;just goin&rsquo; 
      to be married and all, now they say he&rsquo;s drowned&mdash;why? Why was that
      necessary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery could not reply. The old lady did not wait for him to do so. The
      mention of Captain Nat&rsquo;s name reminded her of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Gracie!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turrible hard on her. I went down to see
      her two or three times afore I was took with this backache. She&rsquo;s an awful
      nice girl. And pretty as a pink, too. Don&rsquo;t you think so? Hey? don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been kind of expectin&rsquo; she might get up to see me. Hannah
      Poundberry told the Berrys that she said she was comin&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t care
      about her bein&rsquo; a Come-Outer. I ain&rsquo;t proud, Mr. Ellery. And there&rsquo;s
      Come-Outers and COME-Outers. Proud! Lord &lsquo;a&rsquo; mercy! what has an old woman,
      next door to the poorhouse, got to be proud over? Yes, she told Hannah she
      was comin&rsquo;, and the Berry folks thought it might be to-day. So I&rsquo;ve been
      watchin&rsquo; for her. What! you ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo;, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must, Mrs. Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Do stay a spell longer. Gracie might come and I&rsquo;d like for you
      to meet her. She needs sympathy and comfort an awful lot, and there&rsquo;s no
      tellin&rsquo;, you might convert her to bein&rsquo; a Reg&rsquo;lar. Oh, yes, you might.
      You&rsquo;ve got the most persuadin&rsquo; way, everybody says so. And you don&rsquo;t know
      her very well, do you? Land sakes alive! talk about angels! I snum if she
      ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; up the road this blessed minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery had risen. Now he seized his hat and moved hastily toward the
      door. Mrs. Prince called to him to remain, but he would not. However, her
      good-bys delayed him for a minute, and before he reached the yard gate
      Grace was opening it. They were face to face for the first time since they
      had parted in the grove, so many months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinner and paler, he saw that. And dressed very quietly in black.
      She looked at him, as he stood before her in the path, and her cheeks
      flushed and her eyes fell. He stepped aside and raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed gravely and murmured a &ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo; Then she passed on up
      the path toward the door. He watched her for an instant and then stepped
      quickly after her. The black gown and the tired look in her eyes touched
      him to the heart. He could not let her go without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned at the sound of his step behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Miss Van Horne,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I merely wanted to tell you how
      deeply I&mdash;we all feel for you in your trouble. I&mdash;I&mdash;I am
      so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said simply, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it sincerely. I&mdash;I did not know Captain Hammond very well,
      but I respected and liked him the first time we met. I shall hope that&mdash;that&mdash;it
      is not so serious as they fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;We are all hoping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; It was dreadfully hard to get words together. &ldquo;I
      have heard so much of the captain from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Aunt Keziah? Yes, she was Nat&rsquo;s warmest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Er&mdash;Mrs. Coffin tells me you are going away. I hope you may
      hear good news and soon. I shall think of you&mdash;of him&mdash;I want
      you to understand that I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and Emeline Berry appeared on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right in, Grace,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Mrs. Prince wants you to. She&rsquo;s
      ahollerin&rsquo; for you to hurry up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by. Thank you again. It was very kind of you to say this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; that was why it was so kind. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand and he took it. He knew that his was trembling, but
      so, too, was hers. The hands fell apart. Grace entered the house and John
      Ellery went out at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Keziah, in the sitting room, trying to read, but finding it
      hard to keep her mind on the book, heard her parson pacing back and forth
      over the straw-matted floor of his chamber. She looked at the clock; it
      was nearly twelve. She shut the book and sighed. Her well-meant words of
      consolation had been a mistake, after all. She should not have spoken
      Grace Van Horne&rsquo;s name.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE MINISTER BOARDS THE SAN JOSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Mr. Ellery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Captain Zeb Mayo who was calling. The captain sat in his antique
      chaise, drawn by the antique white horse, and was hailing the parsonage
      through a speaking trumpet formed by holding both his big hands before his
      mouth. The reins he had tucked between the edge of the dashboard and the
      whip socket. If he had thrown them on the ground he would still have been
      perfectly safe, with that horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, ahoy!&rdquo; roared Captain Zeb through his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window of Zoeth Peters&rsquo;s house, next door to the Regular church, was
      thrown up and Mrs. Peters&rsquo;s head, bound with a blue-and-white handkerchief
      in lieu of a sweeping cap, was thrust forth into the crisp March air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Cap&rsquo;n Mayo?&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Peters. &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; repeated Captain Zeb, peering round the chaise curtain. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me. Is somebody dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s me? Oh! No, Hettie, nobody&rsquo;s dead, though I&rsquo;m likely to bust a
      blood vessel if I keep on yellin&rsquo; much longer. Is the parson to home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, heavens alive! I say is&mdash;Ha, there you be, Mr. Ellery. Mornin&rsquo;,
      Keziah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister and Mrs. Coffin, the former with a napkin in his hand, had
      emerged from the side door of the parsonage and now came hurrying down to
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land of Goshen!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you
      ain&rsquo;t done breakfast yet, and it after seven o&rsquo;clock. Why, we&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; 
      about dinner up to our house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah answered. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Your wife tells me,
      Zeb, that the only time you ain&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; about dinner is when you think
      of breakfast or supper. We ain&rsquo;t so hungry here that we get up to eat in
      the middle of the night. What&rsquo;s the matter? Hettie Peters is hollerin&rsquo; at
      you; did you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I know it? Tut! tut! tut! I&rsquo;d known it if I was a mile away, &lsquo;less I
      was paralyzed in my ears. Let her holler; &lsquo;twill do her good and keep her
      in practice for Come-Outer meetin&rsquo;. Why, Mr. Ellery, I tell you: Em&rsquo;lous
      Sparrow, the fish peddler, stepped up to our house a few minutes ago. He&rsquo;s
      just come down from the shanties over on the shore by the light&mdash;where
      the wreck was, you know&mdash;and he says there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;morphrodite brig
      anchored three or four mile off and she&rsquo;s flyin&rsquo; colors ha&rsquo;f mast and
      union down. They&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a boat&rsquo;s crew together to go off to her and
      see what&rsquo;s the row. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to drive over and I thought maybe you&rsquo;d like
      to go along. I told the old lady&mdash;my wife, I mean&mdash;that I
      thought of pickin&rsquo; you up and she said &lsquo;twas a good idee. Said my likin&rsquo; 
      to cruise with a parson in my old age was either a sign that I was hopeful
      or fearful, she didn&rsquo;t know which; and either way it ought to be
      encouraged. He, he, he! What do you say, Mr. Ellery? Want to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to very much.
      But I ought to work on my sermon this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah cut in here. &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s foot!&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;Let your sermon go for
      this once, do. If it ain&rsquo;t long enough as it is, you can begin again when
      you&rsquo;ve got to the end and preach it over again. Didama Rogers said, last
      circle day, that she could set still and hear you preach right over n&rsquo; 
      over. I&rsquo;d give her a chance, &lsquo;specially if it did keep her still. Keepin&rsquo; 
      Didama still is good Christian work, ain&rsquo;t it, Zeb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Mayo slapped his knee. &ldquo;He, he, he!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re
      right, Keziah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am. I believe it would be Christianity and I KNOW &lsquo;twould be
      work. There! there! run in and get your coat and hat, Mr. Ellery. I&rsquo;ll
      step across and ease Hettie&rsquo;s mind and&mdash;and lungs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went across the road to impart the news of the vessel in distress to
      the curious Mrs. Peters. A moment later the minister, having donned his
      hat and coat, ran down the walk and climbed into the chaise beside Captain
      Zeb. The white horse, stimulated into a creaky jog trot by repeated
      slappings of the reins and roars to &ldquo;Get under way!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cast off!&rdquo; moved
      along the sandy lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the drive the captain and his passenger discussed various topics of
      local interest, among them Captain Nat Hammond and the manner in which he
      might have lost his ship and his life. It was now taken for granted, in
      Trumet and elsewhere, that Nat was dead and would never be heard from
      again. The owners had given up, so Captain Zeb said, and went on to
      enumerate the various accidents which might have happened&mdash;typhoons,
      waterspouts, fires, and even attacks by Malay pirates&mdash;though, added
      the captain, &ldquo;Gen&rsquo;rally speakin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d ruther not bet on any pirate gettin&rsquo; 
      away with Nat Hammond&rsquo;s ship, if the skipper was alive and healthy. Then
      there&rsquo;s mutiny and fevers and collisions, and land knows what all. And,
      speakin&rsquo; of trouble, what do you cal&rsquo;late ails that craft we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to
      look at now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They found a group on the beach discussing that very question. A few
      fishermen, one or two lobstermen and wreckers, and the lightkeeper were
      gathered on the knoll by the lighthouse. They had a spyglass, and a
      good-sized dory was ready for launching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she, Noah?&rdquo; asked Captain Zeb of the lightkeeper. &ldquo;That her off
      back of the spar buoy? Let me have a squint through that glass; my eyes
      ain&rsquo;t what they used to be, when I could see a whale spout two miles
      t&rsquo;other side of the sky line and tell how many barrels of ile he&rsquo;d try
      out, fust look. Takes practice to keep your eyesight so&rsquo;s you can see
      round a curve like that,&rdquo; he added, winking at Ellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a brigantine, Zeb,&rdquo; observed the keeper, handing up the spyglass.
      &ldquo;And flyin&rsquo; the British colors. Look&rsquo;s if she might be one of them salt
      boats from Turk&rsquo;s Islands. But what she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; out there, anchored, with
      canvas lowered and showin&rsquo; distress signals in fair weather like this, is
      more&rsquo;n any of us can make out. She wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t there last evenin&rsquo;, though, and
      she is there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t the only funny thing along shore this mornin&rsquo;, nuther,&rdquo;
       announced Theophilus Black, one of the fishermen. &ldquo;Charlie Burgess just
      come down along and he says there&rsquo;s a ship&rsquo;s longboat hauled up on the
      beach, &lsquo;bout a mile &lsquo;n a half t&rsquo;other side the mouth of the herrin&rsquo; crick
      yonder. Oars in her and all. And she ain&rsquo;t no boat that b&rsquo;longs round
      here, is she, Charlie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Thoph, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Make anything out of her, cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb, who had been inspecting the anchored vessel through the
      spyglass, lowered the latter and seemed puzzled. &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;Blessed if she don&rsquo;t look abandoned to me. Can&rsquo;t see a sign of life
      aboard her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t neither,&rdquo; said Thoph. &ldquo;We was just cal&rsquo;latin&rsquo; to go off to
      her when Charlie come and told us about the longboat. I guess likely we
      can go now; it&rsquo;s pretty nigh smooth as a pond. You&rsquo;ll take an oar, won&rsquo;t
      you, Noah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave the light very well. My wife went over to the village last
      night. You and Charlie and Bill go. Want to go, too, Zeb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll stay here, I guess. The old lady made me promise to keep my feet
      dry afore I left the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to go, Mr. Ellery? Lots of room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister was tempted. The sea always had a fascination for him and the
      mystery of the strange ship was appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I won&rsquo;t be in the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! &lsquo;course you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Burgess. &ldquo;Come right along. You set in
      the bow, if you don&rsquo;t mind gettin&rsquo; sprinkled once in a while. I&rsquo;ll steer
      and Thoph and Bill&rsquo;ll row. That&rsquo;ll be enough for one dory. If we need
      more, we&rsquo;ll signal. Heave ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The surf, though low for that season of the year, looked dangerous to
      Ellery, but his companions launched the dory with the ease which comes of
      experience. Burgess took the steering oar and Thoph and &ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; the latter
      a lobsterman from Wellmouth Neck, bent their broad backs for the long
      pull. The statement concerning the pondlike smoothness of the sea was
      something of an exaggeration. The dory climbed wave after wave, long and
      green and oily, at the top of each she poised, tipped and slid down the
      slope. The minister, curled up in the bow on a rather uncomfortable
      cushion of anchor and roding, caught glimpses of the receding shore over
      the crests behind. One minute he looked down into the face of Burgess,
      holding the steering oar in place, the next the stern was high above him
      and he felt that he was reclining on the back of his neck. But always the
      shoulders of the rowers moved steadily in the short, deep strokes of the
      rough water oarsman, and the beach, with the white light and red-roofed
      house of the keeper, the group beside it, and Captain Zeb&rsquo;s horse and
      chaise, grew smaller and less distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Charlie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Thoph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steersman, who was staring hard in the direction they were going,
      scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted again. &ldquo;I swan to man, fellers, I believe she IS
      abandoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; panted Bill, twisting his neck to look over his shoulder.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Course she ain&rsquo;t! Who&rsquo;d abandon a craft such weather&rsquo;s this, and
      Province-town harbor only three hours&rsquo; run or so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it comes to that,&rdquo; commented Burgess, &ldquo;why should they anchor off
      here, &lsquo;stead of takin&rsquo; her in by the inlet? If there&rsquo;s anybody aboard they
      ain&rsquo;t showed themselves yet. She might have been leakin&rsquo;, but she don&rsquo;t
      look it. Sets up out of water pretty well. Well, we&rsquo;ll know in a few
      minutes. Hit her up, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rowers &ldquo;hit her up&rdquo; and the dory moved faster. Then Burgess, putting
      his hand to his mouth, hailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy the brig!&rdquo; bellowed Burgess. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter aboard there? All
      hands asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer. Thoph and Bill pulled more slowly now. Burgess nodded to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Easy! Way enough! Let her run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dory slackened speed, turned in obedience to the steering oar, and
      slid under the forequarter of the anchored vessel. Ellery, looking up, saw
      her name in battered gilt letters above his head&mdash;the San Jose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by, Thoph!&rdquo; shouted Charlie. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you can jump and grab her
      forechains? Hold her steady, Bill. Now, Thoph! That&rsquo;s the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thoph had jumped, seized the chains, and was scrambling aboard. A moment
      later he appeared at the rail amidships, a rope in his hand. The dory was
      brought alongside and made fast; then one after the other the men in the
      boat climbed to the brig&rsquo;s deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahoy!&rdquo; yelled Burgess. &ldquo;All hands on deck! tumble up, you lubbers! Humph!
      She is abandoned, sure and sartin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; assented Bill. &ldquo;Her boats are gone. See? Guess that explains the
      longboat on the beach, Charlie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late it does; but it don&rsquo;t explain why they left her. She ain&rsquo;t
      leakin&rsquo; none to speak of, that&rsquo;s sure. Rides&rsquo;s light&rsquo;s a feather.
      Christmas! look at them decks; dirty hogs, whoever they was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The decks were dirty, and the sails, sloppily furled, were dirty likewise.
      The brig, as she rolled and jerked at her anchor rope, was dirty&mdash;and
      unkempt from stem to stern. To Ellery&rsquo;s mind she made a lonesome picture,
      even under the clear, winter sky and bright sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoph led the way aft. The cabin companion door was open and they peered
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; sniffed Burgess. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t no cologne bottle, is she? Well, come
      on below and let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;ll we see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cabin was a &ldquo;mess,&rdquo; as Bill expressed it. The floor was covered with
      scattered heaps of riff-raff, oilskins, coats, empty bottles, and papers.
      On the table a box stood, its hinged lid thrown back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Medicine chest,&rdquo; said Burgess, examining it. &ldquo;And rum bottles aplenty.
      Somebody&rsquo;s been sick, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister opened the door of one of the little staterooms. The light
      which shone through the dirty and tightly closed &ldquo;bull&rsquo;s-eye&rdquo; window
      showed a tumbled bunk, the blankets soiled and streaked. The smell was
      stifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, fellers,&rdquo; whispered Thoph, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this much myself. I&rsquo;m for
      gettin&rsquo; on deck where the air&rsquo;s better. Somethin&rsquo;s happened aboard this
      craft, somethin&rsquo; serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charlie and Bill nodded an emphatic affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better look about a little more?&rdquo; asked Ellery. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      another stateroom there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door of it as he spoke. It was, if possible, in a worse
      condition than the first. And the odor was even more overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skipper&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; observed Burgess, peeping in. &ldquo;And that bunk ain&rsquo;t been
      slept in for weeks. See the mildew on them clothes. Phew! I&rsquo;m fair sick to
      my stomach. Come out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On deck, in the sunlight, they held another consultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queerest business ever I see,&rdquo; observed Charlie. &ldquo;I never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see somethin&rsquo; like it once,&rdquo; interrupted Bill. &ldquo;Down in the Gulf &lsquo;twas.
      I was on the old Fishhawk. Eben Salters&rsquo;s dad from over to Bayport
      skippered her. We picked up a West Injy schooner, derelict, abandoned same
      as this one, but not anchored, of course. Yeller jack was the trouble
      aboard her and&mdash;Where you bound, Thoph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to take a squint at the fo&rsquo;castle,&rdquo; replied Theophilus, moving
      forward. The minister followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fo&rsquo;castle hatchway was black and grim. Ellery knelt and peered down.
      Here there was practically no light at all and the air was fouler than
      that in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See anything, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo; asked Thoph, looking over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see anything. But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; down there, be you? I wouldn&rsquo;t. No tellin&rsquo; what
      you might find. Well, all right. I ain&rsquo;t curious. I&rsquo;ll stay up here and
      you can report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped over and leaned against the rail. Bill came across the deck and
      joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Charlie?&rdquo; asked Thoph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone back to the cabin,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Thought likely he might find
      some of her papers or somethin&rsquo; to put us on the track. I told him to
      heave ahead; I didn&rsquo;t want no part of it. Too much like that yeller-jack
      schooner to suit me. What&rsquo;s become of the parson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thoph pointed to the open hatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down yonder, explorin&rsquo; the fo&rsquo;castle,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He can have the job,
      for all me. Phew! Say, Bill, what IS this we&rsquo;ve struck, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery descended the almost perpendicular ladder gingerly, holding on with
      both hands. At its foot he stopped and tried to accustom his eyes to the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A room perhaps ten feet long, so much he could make out. The floor strewn,
      like that of the cabin, with heaps of clothing and odds and ends. More
      shapes of clothes hanging up and swaying with the roll of the brig. A
      little window high up at the end, black with dirt. And cavities, bunks in
      rows, along the walls. A horrible hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward the center of the room, bending his head to avoid
      hitting the fo&rsquo;castle lantern. Then in one of the bunks something stirred,
      something alive. He started violently, controlled himself with an effort,
      and stumbled toward the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Who is it? Is anyone there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A groan answered him. Then a voice, weak and quavering, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme a drink! Gimme a drink! Can&rsquo;t none of you God-forsaken devils give
      me a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over the bunk. A man was lying in it, crumpled into a dreadful
      heap. He stooped lower, looked, and saw the man&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shout from the deck, or, rather, a yell. Then more yells and
      the sound of running feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; screamed Burgess, at the hatchway. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, for the
      Almighty&rsquo;s sake, come up here! Come out of that this minute. Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister knew what was coming, was sure of it as he stepped to the
      foot of the ladder, had known it the instant he saw that face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; shrieked Burgess. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, are you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; answered the minister, slowly. He was fighting with all
      his might to keep his nerves under control. His impulse was to leap up
      those steps, rush across that deck, spring into the dory and row, anywhere
      to get away from the horror of that forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up!&rdquo; called Burgess. &ldquo;Hurry! It&rsquo;s the smallpox! The darned hooker&rsquo;s
      rotten with it. For God sakes, come quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran to the rail, yelling order to Bill and Thoph, who were frantically
      busy with the dory. Ellery began to climb the ladder. His head emerged
      into the clean, sweet air blowing across the deck. He drew a breath to the
      very bottom of his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from behind and below him came the voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gimme a drink!&rdquo; it wailed. &ldquo;Gimme a drink of water. Ain&rsquo;t one of you
      cussed swabs got decency enough to fetch me a drink? I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo; for a
      drink, I tell you. I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister stood still, his feet on the ladder. The three men by the
      rail were working like mad, their faces livid under the sunburn and their
      hands trembling. They pushed each other about and swore. They were not
      cowards, either. Ellery knew them well enough to know that. Burgess had,
      that very winter, pulled a skiff through broken ice in the face of a
      wicked no&rsquo;theaster to rescue an old neighbor whose dory had been capsized
      in the bay while he was hauling lobster pots. But now Burgess was as
      scared as the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoph and Bill sprang over the rail into the boat. Burgess turned and
      beckoned to Ellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;What are you waitin&rsquo; for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister remained where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure! Blast it all! I found the log. It ain&rsquo;t been kept for a fortni&rsquo;t,
      but there&rsquo;s enough. It&rsquo;s smallpox, I tell you. Two men died of it three
      weeks ago. The skipper died right afterwards. The mate&mdash;No wonder
      them that was left run away as soon as they sighted land. Come on! Do you
      want to die, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the poison pit at the foot of the ladder the man in the bunk called
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he screeched. &ldquo;Water! Are you goin&rsquo; to leave me, you d&mdash;n
      cowards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven sakes!&rdquo; cried Burgess, clutching the rail, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery answered him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of them,&rdquo; he said, and his voice sounded
      odd in his own ears. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the&mdash;Down THERE? Has he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; screamed the voice shrilly. &ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; to leave me to
      die all alone? He-elp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister turned. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he called, in answer to the voice, &ldquo;hush!
      I&rsquo;ll bring you water in a minute. Burgess,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you and the rest go
      ashore. I shall stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay? You&rsquo;ll STAY? With THAT? You&rsquo;re crazy as a loon. Don&rsquo;t be a
      fool, man! Come on! We&rsquo;ll send the doctor and somebody else&mdash;some one
      that&rsquo;s had it, maybe, or ain&rsquo;t afraid. I am and I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t be a
      fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thoph, from the dory, shouted to know what was the matter. Ellery climbed
      the ladder to the deck and walked over to the rail. As he approached,
      Burgess fell back a few feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thoph,&rdquo; said the minister, addressing the pair in the dory, &ldquo;there is a
      sick man down in the forecastle. He has been alone there for hours, I
      suppose, certainly since his shipmates ran away. If he is left longer
      without help, he will surely die. Some one must stay with him. You and the
      rest row ashore and get the doctor and whoever else you can. I&rsquo;ll stay
      here till they come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thoph and his companions set up a storm of protest. It was foolish, it was
      crazy, the man would die anyhow, and so on. They begged the minister to
      come with them. But he was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to argue,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Hurry and get the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Charlie,&rdquo; ordered Bill. &ldquo;No use talkin&rsquo; to him, he&rsquo;s set. Come
      on! I won&rsquo;t stay alongside this craft another minute for nobody. If you be
      comin&rsquo;, come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Burgess, still protesting, clambered over the rail. The dory swung clear
      of the brig. The rowers settled themselves for the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better change your mind, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; pleaded Charlie. &ldquo;I hate to leave
      you this way. It seems mean, but I&rsquo;m a married man with children, like the
      rest of us here, and I can&rsquo;t take no risks. Better come, too. No? Well,
      we&rsquo;ll send help quick as the Lord&rsquo;ll let us. By the Almighty!&rdquo; he added,
      in a sudden burst, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got more spunk than I have&mdash;yes, or
      anybody I ever come across. I&rsquo;ll say that for you, if you are a parson.
      Give way, fellers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oars dipped, bent, and the dory moved off. The sound of the creaking
      thole pins shot a chill through Ellery&rsquo;s veins. His knees shook, and
      involuntarily a cry for them to come back rose to his lips. But he choked
      it down and waved his hand in farewell. Then, not trusting himself to look
      longer at the receding boat, he turned on his heel and walked toward the
      forecastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water butts stood amidships, not far from the open door of the galley.
      Entering the latter he found an empty saucepan. This he filled from the
      cask, and then, with it in his hand, turned toward the black hatchway.
      Here was the greatest test of his courage. To descend that ladder,
      approach that bunk, and touch the terrible creature in it, these were the
      tasks he had set himself to do, but could he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaccination in those days was by no means the universal custom that it now
      is. And smallpox, even now, is a disease the name of which strikes panic
      to a community. The minister had been vaccinated when he was a child, but
      that was&mdash;so it seemed to him&mdash;a very long time ago. And that
      forecastle was so saturated with the plague that to enter it meant almost
      certain infection. He had stayed aboard the brig because the pitiful call
      for help had made leaving a cowardly impossibility. Now, face to face, and
      in cold blood, with the alternative, it seemed neither so cowardly or
      impossible. The man would die anyhow, so Thoph had said; was there any
      good reason why he should risk dying, too, and dying in that way?
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of a great many things and of many people as he stood by the
      hatchway, waiting; among others, he thought of his housekeeper, Keziah
      Coffin. And, somehow, the thought of her, of her pluck, and her
      self-sacrifice, were the very inspirations he needed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the duty
      that&rsquo;s been laid on me,&rdquo; Keziah had said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a hard one, but I
      don&rsquo;t run away from it.&rdquo; He began to descend the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick man was raving in delirium when he reached him, but the sound of
      the water lapping the sides of the saucepan brought him to himself. He
      seized Ellery by the arm and drank and drank. When at last he desisted,
      the pan was half empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister laid him gently back in the bunk and stepped to the foot of
      the ladder for breath. This made him think of the necessity for air in the
      place and he remembered the little window. It was tightly closed and
      rusted fast. He went up to the deck, found a marlin spike, and, returning,
      broke the glass. A sharp, cold draught swept through the forecastle,
      stirring the garments hanging on the nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, two dories bumped against the side of the San Jose. Men,
      talking in low tones, climbed over the rail. Burgess was one of them;
      ashamed of his panic, he had returned to assist the others in bringing the
      brigantine into a safer anchorage by the inlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker, very grave but businesslike, reached the deck among the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister&rsquo;s head and shoulders appeared at the forecastle companion.
      &ldquo;Here I am, doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor made no answer in words, but he hurried briskly across the
      deck. One man, Ebenezer Capen, an old fisherman and ex-whaler from East
      Trumet, started to follow him, but he was the only one. The others waited,
      with scared faces, by the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get her under way and inshore as soon as you can,&rdquo; ordered Dr. Parker.
      &ldquo;Ebenezer, you can help. If I need you below, I&rsquo;ll call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister backed down the ladder and the doctor followed him. Parker
      bent over the bunk for a few moments in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s pretty bad,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Mighty little chance. Heavens, what a
      den! Who broke that window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Ellery. &ldquo;The air down here was dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor nodded approvingly. &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough
      now. We&rsquo;ve got to get this poor fellow out of here as soon as we can or
      he&rsquo;ll die before to-morrow. Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he added sharply, &ldquo;what made you
      do this? Don&rsquo;t you realize the risk you&rsquo;ve run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one had to do it. You are running the same risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just the same, and, besides, it&rsquo;s my business. Why didn&rsquo;t you let
      some one else, some one we could spare&mdash;Humph! Confound it, man!
      didn&rsquo;t you know any better? Weren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone rasped Ellery&rsquo;s shaken nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I was,&rdquo; he snapped irritably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Well, all right; I beg your pardon. But you oughtn&rsquo;t to have done
      it. Now you&rsquo;ll have to be quarantined. And who in thunder I can get to
      stay with me in this case is more than I know. Just say smallpox to this
      town and it goes to pieces like a smashed egg. Old Eb Capen will help, for
      he&rsquo;s had it, but it needs more than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take&mdash;him?&rdquo; pointing to the moaning occupant
      of the bunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To one of the empty fish shanties on the beach. There are beds there,
      such as they are, and the place is secluded. We can burn it down when the
      fuss is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why can&rsquo;t I stay? I shall have to be quarantined, I know that. Let
      me be the other nurse. Why should anyone else run the risk? I HAVE run it.
      I&rsquo;ll stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker looked at him. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Well! I must say, young
      man, that you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;Humph! All right, Mr. Ellery; I&rsquo;m much
      obliged.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH EBENEZER CAPEN IS SURPRISED
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before sunset that afternoon the San Jose was anchored behind the point by
      the inlet. The fishing boats changed moorings and moved farther up, for
      not a single one of their owners would trust himself within a hundred
      yards of the stricken brigantine. As soon as the anchors were dropped, the
      volunteer crew was over side and away, each of its members to receive a
      scolding from his family for taking such a risk and to have his garments
      sulphur-smoked or buried. Charlie Burgess, whose wife was something of a
      Tartar, observed ruefully that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t take no comfort &lsquo;round home
      nowadays; between the smell of brimstone and the jawin&rsquo;s &lsquo;twas the
      hereafter ahead of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The largest of the beach shanties, one which stood by itself a quarter of
      a mile from the light, was hurriedly prepared for use as a pesthouse and
      the sick sailor was carried there on an improvised stretcher. Dr. Parker
      and Ellery lifted him from his berth and, assisted by old Ebenezer Capen,
      got him up to the deck and lowered him into the dory. Ebenezer rowed the
      trio to the beach and the rest of the journey was comparatively easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shanty had three rooms, one of which was given up to the patient, one
      used as a living room, and, in the third, Capen and the minister were to
      sleep. Mattresses were procured, kind-hearted and sympathizing townspeople
      donated cast-off tables and chairs, and the building was made as
      comfortable as it could be, under the circumstances. Sign boards, warning
      strangers to keep away, were erected, and in addition to them, the Trumet
      selectmen ordered ropes stretched across the lane on both sides of the
      shanty. But ropes and signs were superfluous. Trumet in general was in a
      blue funk and had no desire to approach within a mile of the locality.
      Even the driver of the grocery cart, when he left the day&rsquo;s supply of
      provisions, pushed the packages under the ropes, yelled a hurried &ldquo;Here
      you be!&rdquo; and, whipping up his horse, departed at a rattling gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village sat up nights to discuss the affair and every day brought a
      new sensation. The survivors of the San Jose&rsquo;s crew, a wretched,
      panic-stricken quartette of mulattos and Portuguese, were apprehended on
      the outskirts of Denboro, the town below Trumet on the bay side, and were
      promptly sequestered and fumigated, pending shipment to the hospital at
      Boston. Their story was short but grewsome. The brigantine was not a Turks
      Islands boat, but a coaster from Jamaica. She had sailed with a small
      cargo for Savannah. Two days out and the smallpox made its appearance on
      board. The sufferer, a negro foremast hand, died. Then another sailor was
      seized and also died. The skipper, who was the owner, was the next victim,
      and the vessel was in a state of demoralization which the mate, an
      Englishman named Bradford, could not overcome. Then followed days and
      nights of calm and terrible heat, of pestilence and all but mutiny. The
      mate himself died. There was no one left who understood navigation. At
      last came a southeast gale and the San Jose drove before it. Fair weather
      found her abreast the Cape. The survivors ran her in after dark, anchored,
      and reached shore in the longboat. The sick man whom they had left in the
      forecastle was a new hand who had shipped at Kingston. His name was
      Murphy, they believed. They had left him because he was sure to die, like
      the others, and, besides, they knew some one would see the distress
      signals and investigate. That was all, yes. Santa Maria! was it not
      enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      This tale was a delicious tidbit for Didama and the &ldquo;daily advertisers,&rdquo;
       but, after all, it was a mere side dish compared to Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s
      astonishing behavior. That he, the minister of the Regular church, should
      risk his life, risk dying of the smallpox, to help a stranger and a common
      sailor, was incomprehensible. Didama, at least, could not understand it,
      and said so. &ldquo;My soul and body!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with uplifted hands. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t go nigh my own grandfather if he had the smallpox, let alone
      settin&rsquo; up with a strange critter that I didn&rsquo;t know from Adam&rsquo;s cat. And
      a minister doin&rsquo; it! He ought to consider the congregation, if he done
      nothin&rsquo; else. Ain&rsquo;t we more important than a common water rat that, even
      when he&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo;, swears, so I hear tell, like a ship&rsquo;s poll parrot? I
      never heard of such foolishness. It beats ME!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It &ldquo;beat&rdquo; a good many who, like the Widow Rogers, could not understand
      self-sacrifice. But there were more, and they the majority of Trumet&rsquo;s
      intelligent people, who understood and appreciated. Dr. Parker, a man with
      a reputation for dangerously liberal views concerning religious matters
      and an infrequent attendant at church, was enthusiastic and prodigal of
      praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; vowed the doctor. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s MY kind of Christianity. That&rsquo;s the
      kind of parson I can tie to. I&rsquo;m for John Ellery after this, first, last,
      and all the time. And if he don&rsquo;t get the smallpox and die, and if he does
      live to preach in the Regular church, you&rsquo;ll see me in one of the front
      pews every Sunday. That&rsquo;s what I think of him. Everybody else ran away and
      I don&rsquo;t blame &lsquo;em much. But he stayed. Yes, sir, by George! he stayed.
      &lsquo;Somebody had to do it,&rsquo; says he. I take off my hat to that young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb Mayo went about cheering for his parson. Mrs. Mayo cooked
      delicacies to be pushed under the ropes for the minister&rsquo;s consumption.
      The parish committee, at a special session, voted an increase of salary
      and ordered a weekly service of prayer for the safe delivery of their
      young leader from danger. Even Captain Elkanah did not try to oppose the
      general opinion; &ldquo;although I cannot but feel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s
      course was rash and that he should have considered us and our interest in
      his welfare before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dum it all!&rdquo; roared Captain Zeb, jumping to his feet and interrupting,
      &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t consider himself, did he? and ain&rsquo;t he as important TO himself
      as you, Elkanah Daniels, or anybody else in this meetin&rsquo; house? Bah! don&rsquo;t
      let&rsquo;s have no more talk like that or I&rsquo;ll say somethin&rsquo; that won&rsquo;t be fit
      to put in the minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even at Come-Outers&rsquo; meeting, when Ezekiel Bassett hinted at a &ldquo;just
      punishment fallin&rsquo; on the head of the leader of the Pharisees,&rdquo; Thoph
      Black rose and defended Ellery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah Coffin was, perhaps, the one person most disturbed by her parson&rsquo;s
      heroism. She would have gone to the shanty immediately had not Dr. Parker
      prevented. Even as it was, she did go as far as the ropes, but there she
      was warded off by Ebenezer until Ellery came running out and bade her come
      no nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shan&rsquo;t stay here, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; vowed Keziah. &ldquo;Or, if you do, I&rsquo;ll
      stay, too. I ain&rsquo;t afraid of smallpox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; confessed the minister, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to let anyone I care
      for expose themselves to it unnecessarily. If you try to come in here I
      shall&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;well, Capen and I will put you off the
      premises by force. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah smiled, too, in spite of herself. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d have your hands
      full,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;O John, what in the world made you do this thing? It&rsquo;s
      dreadful. I shan&rsquo;t sleep a wink, thinkin&rsquo; of you. I just must come here
      and help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t. You can come as far as the&mdash;the dead line once in a
      while, if Captain Mayo will drive you over, but that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m all right.
      Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m feeling tiptop and I&rsquo;m not going to be sick. Now
      go home and make me some of that&mdash;some of those puddings of yours. We
      can use them to advantage, can&rsquo;t we, Capen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bet yer!&rdquo; replied Ebenezer with enthusiasm. Keziah, after more
      expostulation, went back to the parsonage, where the puddings were made
      and seasoned with tears and fervent prayers. She wrote to Grace and told
      her the news of the San Jose, but she said nothing of the minister&rsquo;s part
      in it. &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; sighed Keziah, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s bearin&rsquo; enough already. Her
      back ain&rsquo;t as strong as mine, maybe, and mine&rsquo;s most crackin&rsquo;. Well, let
      it crack for good and all; I don&rsquo;t know but that&rsquo;s the easiest way out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sick sailor grew no better. Days and nights passed and he raved and
      moaned or lay in a stupor. Ebenezer acted as day nurse while Ellery slept,
      and, at night, the minister, being younger, went on watch. The doctor came
      frequently, but said there was no hope. A question of time only, and a
      short time, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capen occupied his mind with speculations concerning the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, parson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seem&rsquo;s if I&rsquo;d seen the feller somewheres
      afore. &lsquo;Course I never have, but when I used to go whalin&rsquo; v&rsquo;yages I
      cruised from one end of creation to t&rsquo;other, pretty nigh, and I MIGHT have
      met him. However, his own folks wouldn&rsquo;t know him now, would they? so I
      cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;m just gettin&rsquo; foolish in my old age. Said his name&rsquo;s Murphy,
      them ha&rsquo;f-breeds did, didn&rsquo;t they? I know better&rsquo;n that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Ellery, idly listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause when he&rsquo;s floppin&rsquo; round on the bed, out of his head, he sings out
      all kinds of stuff. A good deal of it&rsquo;s plain cussin&rsquo;, but there&rsquo;s times
      when he talks respectable and once I heard him say &lsquo;darn&rsquo; and another time
      &lsquo;I cal&rsquo;late.&rsquo; Now no Irishman says THAT. That&rsquo;s Yankee, that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he ought to know his own name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prob&rsquo;ly he does&mdash;or used to&mdash;but &lsquo;most likely he don&rsquo;t want
      nobody else to know it. That&rsquo;s why he said &lsquo;twas Murphy and, bein&rsquo; as he
      DID say it, I know &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t it. See my argument, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm! Why, land sakes, names don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo; with seafarin&rsquo; 
      men. I&rsquo;ve seen the time when I had more names&mdash;Humph! Looks kind of
      squally off to the east&rsquo;ard, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night the sick man was much worse. His ravings were incessant. The
      minister, sitting in his chair in the living room, by the cook stove,
      could hear the steady stream of shouts, oaths, and muttered fragments of
      dialogue with imaginary persons. Sympathy for the sufferer he felt, of
      course, and yet he, as well as Dr. Parker and old Capen, had heard enough
      to realize that the world would be none the worse for losing this
      particular specimen of humanity. The fellow had undoubtedly lived a hard
      life, among the roughest of companions afloat and ashore. Even Ebenezer,
      who by his own confession, was far from being a saint, exclaimed
      disgustedly at the close of a day&rsquo;s watching by the sick bed: &ldquo;Phew! I
      feel&rsquo;s if I&rsquo;d been visiting state&rsquo;s prison. Let me set out doors a spell
      and listen to the surf. It&rsquo;s clean, anyhow, and that critter&rsquo;s talk makes
      me want to give my brains a bath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wooden clock, loaned by Mrs. Parker, the doctor&rsquo;s wife, ticked
      steadily, although a half hour slow. Ellery, glancing at it to see if the
      time had come for giving medicine, suddenly noticed how loud its ticking
      sounded. Wondering at this, he was aware there was no other sound in the
      house. He rose and looked in at the door of the adjoining room. The
      patient had ceased to rave and was lying quiet on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister tiptoed over to look at him. And, as he did so, the man
      opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; he said faintly. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery, startled, made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the man again. Then, with an oath, he repeated the
      question, adding: &ldquo;What place is this? This ain&rsquo;t the fo&rsquo;castle. Where am
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ashore. You&rsquo;ve been sick. Don&rsquo;t try to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick? Humph! Sick? &lsquo;Course I been sick. Don&rsquo;t I know it? The d&mdash;n
      cowards run off and left me; blast their eyes! I&rsquo;ll fix &lsquo;em for it one of
      these days, you hear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sshh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush up yourself. Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re ashore. On Cape Cod. At Trumet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trumet! TRUMET!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was struggling to raise himself on his elbow. Ellery was obliged to use
      force to hold him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; pleaded the minister, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t try to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trumet! I ain&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re lyin&rsquo;. Trumet! Good God! Who brought me here? Did
      she&mdash;Is she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struggled again. Then his strength and his reason left him
      simultaneously and the delirium returned. He began to shout a name, a name
      that caused Ellery to stand upright and step back from the bed, scarcely
      believing his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the rest of that night the man on the bed raved and muttered, but of
      people and places and happenings which he had not mentioned before. And
      the minister, listening intently to every word, caught himself wondering
      if he also was not losing his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morning came, Ebenezer Capen was awakened by a shake to find John
      Ellery standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capen,&rdquo; whispered the minister, &ldquo;Capen, get up. I must talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer was indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas priest!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you scare a feller to death,
      comin&rsquo; and yankin&rsquo; him out of bed by the back hair?&rdquo; Then, being more wide
      awake, he added: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row? Worse, is he? He ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I&rsquo;ve got to talk with you. You used to be a whaler, I know. Were
      you acquainted in New Bedford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin. Was a time when I could have located every stick in it, pretty
      nigh, by the smell, if you&rsquo;d set me down side of &lsquo;em blindfold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever know anyone named&mdash;&rdquo; He finished the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure and sartin, I did. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know him well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rsquo;s I wanted to. Pretty decent feller one time, but a fast goer, and
      went downhill like a young one&rsquo;s sled, when he got started. His folks had
      money, that was the trouble with him. Why, &lsquo;course I knew him! He married&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Now, listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery went on talking rapidly and with great earnestness. Ebenezer
      listened, at first silently, then breaking in with ejaculations and grunts
      of astonishment. He sat up on the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he cried at last, &ldquo;why, &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t possible! The feller&rsquo;s dead as
      Methusalem&rsquo;s grandmarm. I remember how it happened and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t true. That much I know. I KNOW, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to explain why he knew. Capen&rsquo;s astonishment grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judas priest!&rdquo; he exclaimed again. &ldquo;That would explain why I thought I&rsquo;d
      seen&mdash;There! heave ahead. I&rsquo;ve got to see. But it&rsquo;s a mistake. I
      don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pair entered the sick room. The sailor lay in a stupor. His breathing
      was rapid, but faint. Capen bent over him and gently moved the bandage on
      his face. For a full minute he gazed steadily. Then he stood erect, drew a
      big red hand across his forehead, and moved slowly back to the living
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Ellery eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenezer sat down in the rocker. &ldquo;Judas priest!&rdquo; he said for the third
      time. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to ME! When it comes my time they&rsquo;ll have to prove I&rsquo;m
      dead. I won&rsquo;t believe it till they do. Ju-das PRIEST!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you recognize him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man nodded solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him. Mr. Ellery, what are you goin&rsquo; to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. I must go somewhere by myself and think. I
      don&rsquo;t know WHAT to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister declined to wait for breakfast. He said he was not hungry.
      Leaving Ebenezer to put on the coffeepot and take up his duties as day
      nurse, Ellery walked off along the beach. The &ldquo;dead line&rdquo; prevented his
      going very far, but he sat down in the lee of a high dune and thought
      until his head ached. What should he do? What was best for him to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the rattle of the doctor&rsquo;s chaise and the voices of Ebenezer and
      Parker in conversation. He did not move, but remained where he was,
      thinking, thinking. By and by he heard Capen calling his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; shouted Ebenezer. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, where be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; replied the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man came scrambling over the sand. He was panting and much
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Mr. Ellery! it&rsquo;s settled for us&mdash;one part of
      it, anyhow. He&rsquo;s slipped his cable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; The minister sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. He must have died just a little while after you left and after I
      gave him his medicine. I thought he looked kind of queer then. And when
      the doctor came we went in together and he was dead. Yes, sir, dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;hm. No doubt of it; it&rsquo;s for good this time. Mr. Ellery, what
      shall we do? Shall I tell Dr. Parker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery considered for a moment. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;No, Capen, don&rsquo;t
      tell anyone. I can&rsquo;t see why they need ever know that he hasn&rsquo;t been dead
      for years, as they supposed. Promise me to keep it a secret. I&rsquo;ll tell&mdash;her&mdash;myself,
      later on. Now promise me; I trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land sakes, yes! I&rsquo;ll promise, if you want me to. I&rsquo;m a widower man, so
      there&rsquo;ll be nobody to coax it out of me. I guess you&rsquo;re right, cal&rsquo;late
      you be. What folks don&rsquo;t know they can&rsquo;t lie about, can they? and that&rsquo;s
      good for your business&mdash;meanin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; disreverent. I&rsquo;ll promise,
      Mr. Ellery; I&rsquo;ll swear to it. Now come on back to the shanty. The doctor
      wants you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day the body of &ldquo;Murphy,&rdquo; foremast hand on the San Jose, was
      buried in the corner of the Regular graveyard, near those who were drowned
      in the wreck of that winter. There was no funeral, of course. The minister
      said a prayer at the shanty, and that was all. Ebenezer drove the wagon
      which was used as hearse for the occasion, and filled in the grave
      himself. So great was the fear of the terrible smallpox that the sexton
      would not perform even that service for its victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capen remained at the shanty another week. Then, as the minister showed no
      symptoms of having contracted the disease and insisted that he needed no
      companion, Ebenezer departed to take up his fishing once more. The old man
      was provided with a new suit of clothes, those he had worn being burned,
      and having been, to his huge disgust, fumigated until, as he said, he
      couldn&rsquo;t smell himself without thinking of a match box, went away. The
      room which the dead sailor had occupied was emptied and sealed tight. The
      San Jose was to stay at her anchorage a while longer. Then, when all
      danger was past, she was to be towed to Boston and sold at auction for the
      benefit of the heirs of her dead skipper and owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellery himself was most urgent in the decision that he should not go back
      to the parsonage and his church just yet. Better to wait until he was
      sure, he said, and Dr. Parker agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that you are
      all right,&rdquo; declared the latter, &ldquo;but I know Trumet, and if I SHOULD let
      you go and you did develop even the tail end of a case of varioloid&mdash;well,
      &lsquo;twould be the everlasting climax for you and me in this county.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staying alone was not unpleasant, in a way. The &ldquo;dead line&rdquo; still
      remained, of course, and callers did not attempt to pass it, but they came
      more frequently and held lengthy conversations at a respectful distance.
      Ellery did his own cooking, what little there was to do, but so many good
      things were pushed under the ropes that he was in a fair way to develop
      weight and indigestion. Captain Zeb Mayo drove down at least twice a week
      and usually brought Mrs. Coffin with him. From them and from the doctor
      the prisoner learned the village news. Once Captain Elkanah and Annabel
      came, and the young lady&rsquo;s gushing praise of the minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;heroism&rdquo; made
      its recipient almost sorry he had ever heard of the San Jose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker told him of Grace Van Horne&rsquo;s return to the village. She had
      come back, so the doctor said, the day before, and was to live at the
      tavern for a while, at least. Yes, he guessed even she had given up hope
      of Captain Nat now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say,&rdquo; went on Parker, &ldquo;how are you feeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, thank you,&rdquo; replied the minister. &ldquo;I seem to be rather tired
      and good for nothing. More so than I was during the worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder. A chap can&rsquo;t go through what you did and not feel some
      reaction. I expected that. Don&rsquo;t get cold, that&rsquo;s all. But what I want to
      know is whether you think I could leave you for a couple of days? The
      Ostable County Medical Society meets at Hyannis to-morrow and I had
      promised myself to take it in this year. But I don&rsquo;t want to leave you, if
      you need me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery insisted that he did not need anyone, was getting along finely, and
      would not hear of his friend&rsquo;s missing the medical society&rsquo;s meeting. So
      the physician went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he called as he drove off. &ldquo;I guess your term is pretty nearly
      over. I shall let you out of jail inside of four or five days, if you
      behave yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This should have been cheering news, but, somehow, John Ellery did not
      feel cheerful that afternoon. The tired feeling he had spoken of so
      lightly was worse than he had described it, and he was despondent, for no
      particular reason. That night he slept miserably and awoke with a chill to
      find a cold, pouring rain beating against the windows of the shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not eat and he could not keep warm, even with the cook-stove top
      red hot and a blanket over his shoulders. By noon the chill had gone and
      he was blazing with fever. Still the rain and the wind, and no visitors at
      the ropes, not even the light-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay down on his bed and tried to sleep, but though he dozed a bit, woke
      always with a start and either a chill or fever fit. His head began to
      ache violently. And then, in the lonesomeness and misery, fear began to
      take hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the symptoms the doctor had warned him against, headache,
      fever, and all the rest. He felt his wrists and arms and began to imagine
      that beneath the skin were the little bunches, like small shot, that were
      the certain indications. Then he remembered how that other man had looked,
      how he had died. Was he to look that way and die like that? And he was all
      alone, they had left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came. The rain had ceased and stars were shining clear. Inside the
      shanty the minister tossed on the bed, or staggered back and forth about
      the two rooms. He wondered what the time might be; then he did not care.
      He was alone. The smallpox had him in its grip. He was alone and he was
      going to die. Why didn&rsquo;t some one come? Where was Mrs. Coffin? And Grace?
      She was somewhere near him&mdash;Parker had said so&mdash;and he must see
      her before he died. He called her name over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind felt cold on his forehead. He stumbled amidst the beach grass.
      What was this thing across his path? A rope, apparently, but why should
      there be ropes in that house? There had never been any before. He climbed
      over it and it was a climb of hundreds of feet and the height made him
      giddy. That was a house, another house, not the one he had been living in.
      And there were lights all about. Perhaps one of them was the light at the
      parsonage. And a big bell was booming. That was his church bell and he
      would be late for the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one was speaking to him. He knew the voice. He had known it always
      and would know it forever. It was the voice he wanted to hear. &ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; he
      called. &ldquo;Grace! I want you. Don&rsquo;t go! Don&rsquo;t go! Grace! oh, my dear! don&rsquo;t
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the voice had gone. No, it had not gone. It was still there and he
      heard it speaking to him, begging him to listen, pleading with him to go
      somewhere, go back, back to something or other. And there was an arm about
      his waist and some one was leading him, helping him. He broke down and
      cried childishly and some one cried with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning, just as day was breaking, a buggy, the horse which
      drew it galloping, rocked and bumped down the lighthouse lane. Dr. Parker,
      his brows drawn together and his lips set with anxiety, was driving. He
      had been roused from sleep in the hotel at Hyannis by a boy with a
      telegram. &ldquo;Come quick,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;Mr. Ellery sick.&rdquo; The sender was Noah
      Ellis, the lightkeeper. The doctor had hired a fast horse, ridden at top
      speed to Bayport, gotten a fresh horse there and hurried on. He stopped at
      his own house but a moment, merely to rouse his wife and ask her if there
      was any fresh news. But she had not even heard of the minister&rsquo;s seizure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul, Will!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the smallpox, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord knows! I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; groaned her husband. &ldquo;WHAT made me leave him?
      I ought to have known better. If that boy dies, I&rsquo;ll never draw another
      easy breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed out, sprang into the buggy, and drove on. At the ropes, early as
      it was, he found a small group waiting and gazing at the shanty. The
      lightkeeper was there and two or three other men. They were talking
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he, Noah?&rdquo; demanded the doctor, jumping to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, doc,&rdquo; replied Ellis. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t heard sence last night when I
      telegraphed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard? What do you mean by that? Haven&rsquo;t you been with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; was the rather sheepish reply. &ldquo;You see, I&mdash;I wanted to, but
      my wife&rsquo;s awful scart I&rsquo;ll catch it and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; Dr. Parker swore impatiently. &ldquo;Who is with him then? You
      haven&rsquo;t left him alone, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; Noah hesitated once more. &ldquo;No-o, he ain&rsquo;t alone. She&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? Who? Keziah Coffin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late Keziah&rsquo;s heard it yet. We was waitin&rsquo; for you &lsquo;fore we
      said much to anybody. But she&rsquo;s there&mdash;the&mdash;the one that found
      him. You see, he was out of his head and wanderin&rsquo; up the lane &lsquo;most to
      the main road and she&rsquo;d been callin&rsquo; on Keziah and when she come away from
      the parsonage she heard him hollerin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo; on and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&rdquo;&mdash;the lightkeeper glanced at his companions&mdash;&ldquo;why, doc,
      &lsquo;twas Grace Van Horne. And she fetched him back to the shanty and then
      come and got me to telegraph you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grace Van Horne! Grace Van&mdash;Do you mean to say she is there with him
      NOW?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She wouldn&rsquo;t leave him. She seemed &lsquo;most as crazy&rsquo;s he was. My wife
      and me, we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Parker did not wait to hear the rest. He ran at full speed to the door
      of the shanty. Grace herself opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; demanded the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he seems a little easier; at any rate, he&rsquo;s not delirious. He&rsquo;s
      in there. Oh, I&rsquo;m so thankful you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the doctor?&rdquo; called Ellery weakly from the next room. &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Parker, throwing off his coat and hat. &ldquo;Coming, Mr.
      Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, doctor, send her away. Don&rsquo;t let her stay. Make her go.
      Make her GO! I&rsquo;ve got the smallpox and if she stays she will die. Don&rsquo;t
      you understand? she MUST go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, John,&rdquo; said Grace soothingly. &ldquo;Hush, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker stopped short and looked at her. She returned the look, but
      without the slightest semblance of self-consciousness or embarrassment.
      She did not realize that she had said anything unusual, which must sound
      inexplicably strange to him. Her thoughts were centered in that adjoining
      room and she wondered why he delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked impatiently. &ldquo;What is it? Why do you wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor did not answer. However, he waited no longer, but hurried in to
      his new patient.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH DECIDES TO FIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The news was flying from house to house along the main road. Breakfasts
      were interrupted as some neighbor rushed in to tell the story which
      another neighbor had brought to him or her. Mr. Ellery was very sick and
      it was feared he had the smallpox, that was what Mrs. Parker, the doctor&rsquo;s
      wife, told those who lived near her. By the time the Corners heard of it
      the tale had grown until the minister was said to be dying. And when it
      reached Gaius Winslow&rsquo;s home at the upper end of the town he was reported
      dead. This was denied, upon investigation, but soon another rumor grew and
      spread; Grace Van Horne was with him, had taken him back to the shanty,
      and insisted upon staying there until the doctor came. Facing that
      dreadful disease and&mdash;It was wonderful&mdash;and queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Danielses&rsquo; house the servant girl rushed into the dining room to
      serve the toast and the story at one swoop. Captain Elkanah&rsquo;s dignity
      deserted him for an instant and his egg spoon jingled to the floor.
      Annabel&rsquo;s face turned a dull red. Her eyes flashed sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t do something now I&rsquo;ll never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father shook his head warningly. &ldquo;Debby,&rdquo; he said to the maid, &ldquo;you
      needn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Debby departed reluctantly. After the kitchen door had closed, Captain
      Elkanah said: &ldquo;My dear, we mustn&rsquo;t be too hasty in this matter. Remember,
      Mr. Ellery is very sick. As for&mdash;for the Van Horne girl, we haven&rsquo;t
      heard the whole truth yet. She may not be there at all, or it may be just
      an accident&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident! Pa, you make me boil. Accident! Accidents like that don&rsquo;t
      happen. If you let her stay there, or if&mdash;Oh, to think of it! And we
      were calling him a hero and&mdash;and everything! Hero! he stayed there
      just so she might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush, child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t hush. Pa, are you going to let him disgrace himself with HER?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Probably there ain&rsquo;t any idea of his marrying her. If there is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there is you put him out of the church and out of this town. And as
      for HER&mdash;O-oh! And we&rsquo;ve been having him here at dinner and&mdash;and
      I have&mdash;Oh, I shall die! I wish I WAS dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed hysterics and agony, greedily listened to by Debby, whose
      ear was at the crack of the door. Captain Elkanah soothed and pleaded and
      tried to pacify. It ended by his promising to investigate and, if
      necessary, take steps &lsquo;immejitly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia Pepper sprung the mine on her brother. Kyan was horrified. He had
      grown to be one of Ellery&rsquo;s most devoted worshipers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smallpox!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;The minister got the smallpox. Oh! that&rsquo;s
      turrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; observed his sister, also horrified, but rather relishing the
      horror. &ldquo;And if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Gracie Van Horne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? I say, if Gracie Van Horne hadn&rsquo;t happened to
      meet him, wanderin&rsquo; around, crazy as a coot, and toted him back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracie&mdash;Van&mdash;Horne! Godfreys mighty! She&mdash;she met him?
      Where? Down to Peters&rsquo;s grove, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peters&rsquo;s grove! No. What on earth made you think &lsquo;twas there? She&rsquo;d been
      visitin&rsquo; Keziah Coffin at the parsonage, and when she come out on the main
      road she heard him aravin&rsquo; down the lane. Must have passed right by this
      house and we never heard him. I never see such a dead man as you be when
      you&rsquo;re asleep. You don&rsquo;t SOUND dead, I&rsquo;ll say that for you, but nothin&rsquo; 
      wakes you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Laviny! you never woke up yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, lay it onto me. I expected you would; it&rsquo;s just like you.
      But why in time did you think Grace met the minister way down to Peters&rsquo;s
      grove? That&rsquo;s the most loony notion ever I heard, even from you. What made
      you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;. I guess I WAS loony, maybe. Dear! dear! dear! have you
      heard how&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; on? Is he took bad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t heard nothin&rsquo; yet, nobody has. But see here, &lsquo;Bish Pepper, you
      act funny to me. I want to know more about that Peters&rsquo;s grove notion. WHY
      did you say it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan wriggled upon the rack and dodged and squirmed for the next twenty
      minutes. He tried his best to keep the fateful secret, but he admitted too
      much, or not enough, and his sister kept up the cross-examination. At the
      end of the session she was still unsatisfied, but she was on the scent and
      her brother knew it. He fled to the woodshed and there punctuated his
      morning task of kindling chopping with groans and awful forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the very first to hear of the minister&rsquo;s illness was Keziah Coffin.
      Mrs. Parker told her and Keziah started for the beach before the tale of
      Grace&rsquo;s part in the night&rsquo;s happenings reached the village. She did not
      wait for a conveyance, hardly waited to throw a shawl over her shoulders,
      but began to cover the three miles on foot. She had walked nearly two
      thirds of the distance when Captain Zeb Mayo overtook her and gave her a
      seat in his chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said little during the drive, the shock and anxiety forbidding
      conversation. At the ropes was the same group, larger now, and Dr.
      Parker&rsquo;s horse was hitched to one of the posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go in, Mrs. Coffin,&rdquo; said Thoph Black. &ldquo;The doctor give us his
      orders not to let nobody get by. I guess nobody wants to, but all the same&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah paid not the slightest attention to Mr. Black. She stooped beneath
      his arm, under the rope and was on her way to the shanty before they
      realized her intention. Captain Zeb roared a command for her to return,
      but she kept on. No one followed, not even the captain. Mrs. Mayo had
      strictly forbidden his passing the dead line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keziah opened the door and entered the little building. The living room
      was empty, but at the sound of her step some one came from the room
      adjoining. That some one was Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What did you come here for? Why did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracie!&rdquo; exclaimed the housekeeper. &ldquo;You?&mdash;YOU?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker appeared, holding up a hand for silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quiet now and I think he will sleep. Don&rsquo;t talk
      here. Go outside, if you must talk&mdash;and I suppose you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grace led the way. Fortunately, the door was on the side not visible from
      the spot where Captain Zeb and the rest were standing. Keziah, bewildered
      and amazed at the girl&rsquo;s presence, followed dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, auntie,&rdquo; whispered Grace, turning to her, &ldquo;you want to know how he
      is, of course. Well, I think he is better. The doctor thinks so, too. But
      why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I come? I? Why, because my place was here. I belonged here. For
      the love of mercy&rsquo;s sakes what are YOU doin&rsquo; here? With HIM? And the
      smallpox!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush. I can&rsquo;t help it. I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t care for anything any more.
      I&rsquo;m glad I came. I&rsquo;m glad I was the one to find him and help him. No
      matter what happens&mdash;to me&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad. I never was so glad
      before. I love him, Aunt Keziah. I can say it to you, for you know it&mdash;you
      must know it. I LOVE him and he needed me and I came. He was calling my
      name when I found him. He might have died there, alone in the wet and
      cold, and I saved him. Think what that means to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was in a sort of frenzy of excitement and hysterical exaltation.
      All the night she had been calm and quiet, repressing her feelings, and
      tending the man she loved. Now, with some one to whom she could confide,
      she was calm no longer. Keziah answered her soothingly, questioning her
      from time to time, until, at last, she learned the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened softly and Dr. Parker came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s better, much better. And I&rsquo;ll tell you
      something else, if you won&rsquo;t make too much noise about it&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t
      got the smallpox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two women looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact,&rdquo; he said, with an emphatic nod. &ldquo;Not a symptom of it. I&rsquo;d have bet
      my best hat that he wasn&rsquo;t going to have it and I won&rsquo;t have to go
      bareheaded yet awhile. He is pretty close to brain fever, though, but I
      guess he&rsquo;ll dodge that this time, with care. On the whole, Keziah, I&rsquo;m
      glad you came. This young lady,&rdquo; with a movement of the head toward Grace,
      &ldquo;has done her part. She really saved his life, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. Now, I
      think she can go away and leave him to you and me. I&rsquo;ll pretty nearly
      guarantee to have him up and out of this&mdash;this pesthole in a
      fortnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was joyful tidings, the better for being so unexpected. Keziah leaned
      against the boards and drew a long breath. Grace said nothing, but, after
      a moment, she went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good thing, too,&rdquo; commented Parker, watching her as she went. &ldquo;I
      wanted to talk with you, Keziah Coffin, and right away. Now, then, there&rsquo;s
      something up, something that I don&rsquo;t know about, and I rather guess you
      do. Young women&mdash;even when they&rsquo;re her kind and that&rsquo;s as good a kind
      as there is&mdash;don&rsquo;t risk smallpox for any young man they pick up
      casually. They don&rsquo;t carry&mdash;I guess it was pretty nearly carrying&mdash;him
      home and put him to bed and care for him and cry over him and call him
      &lsquo;dear.&rsquo; And he doesn&rsquo;t beg them to run away and let him die rather than to
      stay there and risk dying, too. No, not to any great extent. Now, Keziah,
      you and I are fairly good friends and we ought to know each other by this
      time. I see a light&mdash;a little one. Now, then, if you turn up the
      lamp, so that I can see the whole blaze, maybe I can help those two in
      yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah considered. &ldquo;All right, doctor,&rdquo; she said, when she reached a
      decision, &ldquo;all right; I&rsquo;ll tell you the whole thing, and you can see one
      of the reasons why my hair is gettin&rsquo; grayer. This thing has reached the
      point now where there&rsquo;s no keepin&rsquo; it quiet. Folk&rsquo;ll know&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose
      they know already&mdash;that she&rsquo;s been here with him. They&rsquo;ll suspect a
      lot more and the truth is better than suspicion&mdash;that is, it can&rsquo;t be
      worse than the suspicions that come natural to a good many minds in this
      town. I am glad I can tell you, for I guess the time&rsquo;s come to step out in
      broad daylight and h&rsquo;ist our colors. Now, you listen. Here &lsquo;tis, from
      beginnin&rsquo; to end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on to tell all she knew of her parson&rsquo;s love story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I see. What made her change her mind so
      suddenly? You say, or you gather from what Mr. Ellery told you, that she
      had all but agreed to marry him. She cares for him, that&rsquo;s sure. Then, all
      at once, she throws him over and accepts Nat. Of course her uncle&rsquo;s sudden
      seizure was a shock and he wanted Nat to have her, but she isn&rsquo;t the kind
      of girl to be easily swayed. Why did she do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor, that&rsquo;s kind of a puzzle to me. All I can think is that she
      come to realize what it might mean to him, the minister, if he married a
      Come-Outer. I think she done it for his sake, to save him, though what
      made her realize it all at once I don&rsquo;t know. There&rsquo;s the part we ain&rsquo;t
      heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right. Something happened between the time she left Ellery
      and when you and I reached the tavern. But never mind that, that doesn&rsquo;t
      count now. Let&rsquo;s look at things as they are this minute. She&rsquo;s here and
      folks know it. As they do know it they&rsquo;ll begin to talk, and the more they
      talk the farther from the truth they&rsquo;ll get&mdash;most of &lsquo;em. Nat, poor
      chap, is dead, so her promise to him is canceled. Ellery will get well if
      he isn&rsquo;t troubled, and her being with him will help more than anything
      else. I can understand now why he broke down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he ain&rsquo;t been himself since it happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, and the last few weeks of worry and night work have helped to
      wreck his nerves. Well, as I see it, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do. If she
      leaves him he&rsquo;ll go to pieces again, so she mustn&rsquo;t leave. And she can&rsquo;t
      stay without an explanation. I say let&rsquo;s give the explanation; let&rsquo;s come
      right out with the announcement that they&rsquo;re engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew! that&rsquo;ll stir things up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! But let it stir. I like that parson of yours; he&rsquo;s a trump. And
      I always liked her, although, generally speaking, I don&rsquo;t love
      Come-Outers. And I like her more than ever now, when she risked what she
      thought was smallpox to care for him. As I said, she saved his life, and
      she ought to have him. She SHALL have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a Come-Outer and&mdash;there&rsquo;s the church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know it. But he never was so popular as he is now. And she isn&rsquo;t
      by any means a steady-going Come-Outer. Why, Zeke Bassett and the rest
      have been finding fault with her and calling her a backslider. That&rsquo;ll
      help. Then you trust me to whoop up her heroism and the fact that without
      her he would have died. We can do it, Keziah. Come on! I&rsquo;ve tackled a good
      many jobs, but matchmaking isn&rsquo;t one of &lsquo;em. Here goes to tackle that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was delighted; here was work after her own heart. But she still
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve forgot one thing, that&rsquo;s Gracie herself. Would
      she marry him now, knowing it may mean the loss of his ministry and all,
      any more than she would at first? I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your part, Keziah. You&rsquo;ve got to show her she MUST marry him or
      he&rsquo;ll die; see? Call on me to back you up in any fairy yarn you spin. You
      prove to her it&rsquo;s her duty to marry him. You&rsquo;ll have to stay, here and
      help nurse, of course, and that&rsquo;s easy because his disease isn&rsquo;t
      contagious. You convince her and I&rsquo;ll take care of the congregation. He&rsquo;ll
      live to be minister here for the rest of his life, if he wants to, and
      she&rsquo;ll be a minister&rsquo;s wife and sit in the front pew. I&rsquo;ll guarantee the
      church if you&rsquo;ll guarantee the girl. Why, it&rsquo;s your duty! Come, now, what
      do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s hesitation was at an end. Her face lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say good!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be thankful to you all the rest of my
      life. But for the dear mercy sakes, don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;duty&rsquo; to me again. Oh,
      doctor, if you only knew what it means to me to be fightin&rsquo; at last for
      somethin&rsquo; that ain&rsquo;t just duty, but what I really want! I do honestly
      believe we can win. Glory, hallelujah! And now I want to give you a piece
      of advice, your course for the first leg, as you might say: you see Cap&rsquo;n
      Zebedee Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Cap&rsquo;n Zeb is the first man I mean to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb listened with his mouth and eyes and ears open. Mrs. Mayo was
      with him when the doctor called, and she, too, listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, when the plea for support was ended. &ldquo;Well,
      by the flukes of Jonah&rsquo;s whale! Talk about surprises! Old lady, what do
      you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say go ahead, Zebedee. Go ahead! If Mr. Ellery wanted to marry
      Jezebel&rsquo;s sister, and I knew he really wanted to, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I do believe
      I&rsquo;d help him get her. And Grace Van Horne is a good girl. Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; put in Parker, profiting by a hint of Mrs. Coffin&rsquo;s, &ldquo;of
      course Daniels will fight tooth and nail against us. He&rsquo;ll be for
      discharging Ellery at once. And he really runs the parish committee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, hey? Well, I cal&rsquo;late he don&rsquo;t. Not if I&rsquo;m on deck, he don&rsquo;t.
      All right, doctor, I&rsquo;m with you. He, he, he!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Say, doc, do
      you know I sort of love a good lively row. That&rsquo;s been the only trouble
      with our society sence Mr. Ellery took command of it&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t
      been any rows. He, he, he! Well, there&rsquo;ll be one now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was, and it was lively enough to suit even Captain Zeb. Dr. Parker,
      on his calls that day, was assailed with a multitude of questions
      concerning Grace&rsquo;s presence at the shanty. He answered them cheerfully,
      dilating upon the girl&rsquo;s bravery, her good sense, and the fact that she
      had saved Mr. Ellery&rsquo;s life. Then he confided, as a strict secret, the
      fact that the two were engaged. Before his hearers had recovered from the
      shock of this explosion, he was justifying the engagement. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      they marry if they wanted to? It was a free country. The girl wasn&rsquo;t a
      Come-Outer any longer, and, besides&mdash;and this carried weight in a
      good many households&mdash;what a black eye the marriage would be for that
      no-account crowd at the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zebedee, having shipped with the insurgents, worked for them from
      sunrise to sunset and after. Zeb was something of a politician and knew
      whom to &ldquo;get at.&rdquo; He sought his fellows on the parish committee and
      labored with them. Mrs. Mayo and the doctor&rsquo;s wife championed the cause at
      sewing circle. They were lively, those sewing meetings, and the fur flew.
      Didama Rogers and Lavinia Pepper were everywhere and ready to agree with
      whichever side seemed likely to win. Lavinia was so deeply interested that
      she forgot to catechise Abishai further about his untimely reference to
      Peters&rsquo;s grove. And Kyan, puzzled but thankful, kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means a one-sided struggle. Captain Elkanah, spurred on by
      the furious Annabel, marshaled his forces and proclaimed that Ellery,
      having disgraced the Regular Society, should no longer occupy its pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does,&rdquo; thundered Elkanah, &ldquo;I shall never cross the threshold of
      that church. And I&rsquo;ve worshiped there for fifty years. Hum&mdash;ha! I
      should like to know whose money has gone more liberal for that meeting
      house than mine! But not another cent&mdash;no, sir! not one&mdash;if that
      licentious young scamp continues to blaspheme there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hinted concerning a good-sized contribution toward a parish house,
      something the society needed. If Ellery was discharged, the contribution
      would probably be made, not otherwise. And this was a point worth
      considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniels also wrote to his influential friends of the National Regular
      Society. But Captain Zebedee had forestalled him there and both letters
      were laid on the table to await further developments. As for the
      Come-Outers, they were wild with rage and Grace was formally read out of
      their communion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; shrieked Ezekiel Bassett, in prayer meeting, &ldquo;what the sperrit
      of the good and great man who used to lead us from this &lsquo;ere platform
      would say if he was here now? Hey? what would he say?&rdquo;
     </p>

      Josiah Badger upreared his lanky person. &ldquo;I dreamed about Cap&rsquo;n Eben
      t&rsquo;other n-nin-nun-night,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I see him just as&mdash;p-pup-pup-plain
      as you hear me n-n-now. And he says to me, he says, Josiah,&rsquo; he says,
      &lsquo;I-I-I-I&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ki yi!&rdquo; broke in Thoph Baker, from the shadow of the rear seat. Josiah
      turned to berate Thoph, who, being in disgrace because of his defense of
      Ellery, was reckless, and the communication from the dead leader of the
      Come-Outers was lost in the squabble which followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Keziah, installed as head nurse at the shanty, was having her
      troubles. The minister was getting better, slowly but surely getting
      better. The danger of brain fever was at an end, but he was very weak and
      must not be excited, so the doctor said. He knew nothing of the struggle
      for and against him which was splitting Trumet in twain, and care was
      taken that he should not know it. He was not allowed to talk, and, for the
      most part, was quite contented to be silent, watching Grace as she moved
      about the room. If he wondered why she was still with him, he said
      nothing, and the thought of what his congregation might say did not vex
      him in the least. She was there, he saw her every day, that was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had expressed a wish to talk with his housekeeper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something
      to tell you, Aunt Keziah,&rdquo; he said weakly. &ldquo;Some news for you and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s foot!&rdquo; snapped Keziah briskly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t start in tellin&rsquo; me news now.
      I&rsquo;ve got my hands full as &lsquo;tis. News&rsquo;ll keep and you won&rsquo;t, if you talk
      another minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are you, though you may not think so. If you don&rsquo;t believe it ask
      Grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the minister sighed. &ldquo;Well, perhaps I won&rsquo;t tell it now. I&rsquo;d
      rather wait until I feel stronger. You won t care, will you? It will be
      hard to tell and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Care? No. If it&rsquo;s bad news I don&rsquo;t want to hear it, and if it&rsquo;s
      good I can wait, I cal&rsquo;late. You turn over and take a nap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could manage him; it was with Grace that she had her struggle. John
      was safe now; he would be himself again before very long, and the girl had
      begun to think of his future and his reputation. She knew that gossip must
      be busy in the village, and, much as she wished to remain by his side, she
      decided that she should not do so. And then Keziah began to fulfill her
      agreement with Dr. Parker.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, and bluntly, she told the girl that her leaving now was useless.
      The secret was out; it had been made public. Everyone knew she was in love
      with John and he with her. Their engagement was considered an established
      certainty. Grace was greatly agitated and very indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dared say so?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Who dared say we were engaged? It&rsquo;s not
      true. It&rsquo;s a wicked lie and&mdash;Who is responsible, Aunt Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose likely I am, much as anybody, deary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You, Aunt Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup; me. You are in love with him; at any rate, you said so. And you&rsquo;re
      here with him, ain&rsquo;t you? If you two ain&rsquo;t engaged you ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah, how can you speak so? Don&rsquo;t you realize&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here. Don&rsquo;t you want to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WANT to? Oh, please&mdash;How can you? I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-s-sh! There! there! I am a bull-headed old thing, for sure. But I&rsquo;m
      like the dog that chased the rat across the shelf where they kept the best
      china, my intentions are good. Don&rsquo;t cry, deary. Let&rsquo;s get to the bottom
      of this thing, as the man said when he tumbled into the well. When I first
      knew that you and John were in love with each other, I felt dreadful. I
      knew your uncle and I knew Trumet. If you had married then, or let people
      know that you thought of it, &lsquo;twould have been the end, and ruin for John
      and you. But things are diff&rsquo;rent now, a good deal diff&rsquo;rent. John is
      worshiped pretty nigh, since his pluck with that smallpox man. He could go
      into church and dance a jig in the pulpit and nobody&mdash;or precious
      few, at least&mdash;would find fault. And you&rsquo;ve stood by him. If it
      wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for you he wouldn&rsquo;t be here to-day, and people know that. Dr.
      Parker and Captain Zebedee and Gaius Winslow and dozens more are fighting
      for him and for you. And the doctor says they are going to win. Do you
      want to spoil it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Keziah, that night before uncle died I was upstairs in my room and I
      heard uncle and Captain Elkanah Daniels talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elkanah? Was he there at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Somehow or other&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;he had learned about&mdash;about
      John and me. And he was furious. Aunt Keziah, I heard him say that unless
      I broke off with John he would drive him from the ministry and from Trumet
      and disgrace him forever. He said that if I really cared for him I would
      not ruin his life. That brought me to myself. I realized how wicked I had
      been and what I was doing. That was why I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! there! Tut! tut! tut! hum! Now I see. But, Gracie, you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; 
      to ruin his life. No, nor Elkanah ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to do it, either. He can&rsquo;t,
      no matter how hard he tries. I&rsquo;ve lived to see the day when there&rsquo;s a
      bigger man in the Reg&rsquo;lar church than Elkanah Daniels, and I thank the
      good Lord for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never should have come here. I know it. But he needed me. Aunt Keziah,
      he was sick and dying almost, and I couldn&rsquo;t leave him. I came, and now he
      will be ruined and disgraced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, I tell you; he won&rsquo;t. Listen to me. I ain&rsquo;t talkin&rsquo; for my
      health. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She argued and pleaded and coaxed, and, at last, when she began to think
      she had prevailed, Grace brought forward another objection. She had given
      her word to her uncle. How could she break that promise made to a dying
      man? She would feel like a traitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitor to who?&rdquo; demanded the housekeeper, losing patience. &ldquo;Not to poor
      Nat, for he&rsquo;s gone. And don&rsquo;t you suppose that he and Eben understand
      things better now, where they are? Do you suppose that Nat wouldn&rsquo;t want
      you to be happy? I know he would, for I knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was still unsettled when the long talk was over, but Grace agreed not
      to leave the minister at present. She would stay where she was until he
      was himself again, at least. Keziah was satisfied with the preliminary
      skirmish. She felt confident of winning the victory, and in the prospect
      of happiness for others, she was almost happy herself. Yet each time the
      mail was brought to the shanty she dreaded to look at it, and the sight of
      a stranger made her shake with fear. Ansel Coffin had threatened to come
      to Trumet. If he came, she had made up her mind what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parish committee was to meet. Captain Elkanah had announced his
      intention of moving that John Ellery be expelled from the Regular church.
      There was to be no compromise, no asking for a resignation; he must be
      discharged, thrown out in disgrace. The county papers were full of the
      squabble, but they merely reported the news and did not take sides. The
      fight was too even for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Keziah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We know what&rsquo;s
      what and who&rsquo;s who. The Rev. Mr. Ellery can preach here for the next
      hundred year, if he lives that long and wants to, and he can marry whoever
      he darn pleases, besides. Elkanah&rsquo;s licked and he knows it. He ain&rsquo;t got
      enough backers to man a lobster dory. Let him holler; noise don&rsquo;t scare
      grown folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon a few days before the date set for the meeting Elkanah and
      two or three of his henchmen were on the piazza of the Daniels home,
      discussing the situation. They were blue and downcast. Annabel was in the
      sitting room, shedding tears of humiliation and jealous rage on the
      haircloth sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed her father, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing we can do. If the vote in
      committee goes against us, I shall insist on the calling of a
      congregational meeting. Hum&mdash;ha! Yes, I shall insist on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be no good, cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; sniffed Beriah Salters dolefully. &ldquo;The biggest
      part of the congregation&rsquo;s for Ellery, and you know it. They&rsquo;re as sot on
      him as if he was the angel Gabriel. If you&rsquo;d only told what you knew afore
      this smallpox business, we&rsquo;d have been able to give him and his Come-Outer
      woman what b&rsquo;longs to &lsquo;em. But not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Daniels shifted uneasily in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha!&rdquo; he barked, to cover confusion. &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha! It seemed to
      me more&mdash;er&mdash;charitable to give the misguided young man another
      chance, and I did it. But&mdash;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one was talking excitedly on the sidewalk beyond the lilac bushes at
      the border of the Daniels property. Voices answered. Didama Rogers darted
      out of her yard and past the house in the direction of the sounds. Salters
      rose and walked down to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Halloo! Ahoy there! You, Em&rsquo;lous, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emulous Sparrow, the fish peddler, was seated in his cart, which was
      surrounded by men and women, neighbors of the Danielses. There was a
      perfect storm of questionings and ejaculations. Salters opened the gate
      and joined the group. A moment later he came running back, up the walk
      toward the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Elkanah, here&rsquo;s news! What do you think? A
      telegram&rsquo;s just come from Nat Hammond. He&rsquo;s safe and sound in New York,
      and he&rsquo;ll be here day after to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not believe it and rushed out to hear more. Emulous, glowing
      with importance, affirmed that it was so. He had seen the telegram at the
      store. It was for Grace Van Horne and they were just going to send a boy
      over to the shanty with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No details nor nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Just said &lsquo;Am all right. Arrived
      to-day. Will be in Trumet Thursday.&rsquo; And &lsquo;twas signed &lsquo;Nathaniel Hammond.&rsquo; 
      There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by thunder!&rdquo; exclaimed Salters. &ldquo;If that don&rsquo;t beat all. I wonder
      what&rsquo;s happened to him? Two year gone and give up for dead, and now&mdash;What
      do you cal&rsquo;late it means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah seized him by the arm and led him out of the group. The
      old man&rsquo;s face was alight with savage joy and his voice shook with
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing it means,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It means the end of
      Ellery, so far as his marrying her is concerned. She gave her word to
      Hammond and she&rsquo;ll keep it. She&rsquo;s no liar, whatever else she is. He may be
      minister of the Regular church, though I&rsquo;LL never set under him, but he&rsquo;ll
      never marry her, now.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH A RECEPTION IS CALLED OFF
    </h3>
    <p>
      Far out on the Pacific coast there are two small islands, perhaps a
      hundred miles distant from one another. The first of these is uninhabited.
      On the other is a little colony of English-speaking people, half-breed
      descendants of native women and the survivors of a crew from a British
      vessel cast away there in the latter part of the eighteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first of these islands, the smaller one, the Sea Mist had been
      wrecked. Driven out of her course by a typhoon, she staggered through day
      after day and night after night of terrific wind and storm until, at last,
      there was promise of fair weather. Captain Nat, nearly worn out from
      anxiety, care, and the loss of sleep, had gone to his stateroom and the
      first mate was in charge. It was three o&rsquo;clock, the wind still blowing and
      the darkness pitchy, when the forward lookout shrieked a warning,
      &ldquo;Breakers under the lee!&rdquo; Almost the next instant the ship was on a coral
      reef, full of water, and the seas breaking over her from stem to stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came and showed a little patch of land, with palm trees and
      tropical vegetation waving in the gusts and green in the sunshine. Captain
      Nat ordered the boats to be lowered. Much as he hated the thought, he saw
      that the Sea Mist had made her last voyage and must be abandoned. He went
      to the cabin, collected papers and charts and prepared to leave. The
      ship&rsquo;s money, over ten thousand dollars in gold belonging to the owner and
      to be used in trade and speculation among the East Indies, he took with
      him. Then the difficult and dangerous passage through the opening in the
      reef was begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the captain&rsquo;s boat reached the shore. The mate&rsquo;s was caught by a huge
      breaker, dashed against the reef and sunk. Captain Nat, his second mate
      and five of his men were all that was left of the Sea Mist&rsquo;s company. And
      on that island they remained for nearly two weeks. Provisions they had
      brought ashore with them. Water they found by digging. Nat hid the gold at
      night, burying it on the beach below high-water mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having made sure of his location by consulting the chart, he
      determined to attempt a voyage to the second island, where he knew the
      English colony to be. Provisions were getting short, and to remain longer
      where they were was to risk starvation and all its horrors. So, in the
      longboat, which was provided with a sail, they started. Charts and papers
      and the gold the skipper took with them. None of the crew knew of the
      existence of the money; it was a secret which the captain kept to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred miles they sailed in the longboat and, at last, the second
      island was sighted. They landed and found, to their consternation and
      surprise, that it, too, was uninhabited. The former residents had grown
      tired of their isolation and, a trading vessel having touched there, had
      seized the opportunity to depart for Tahiti. Their houses were empty,
      their cattle, sheep, goats, and fowl roamed wild in the woods, and the
      fruit was rotting on the trees. In its way the little island was an
      Eyeless Eden, flowing with milk and honey; but to Captain Nat, a
      conscientious skipper with responsibilities to his owners, it was a prison
      from which he determined to escape. Then, as if to make escape impossible,
      a sudden gale came up and the longboat was smashed by the surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that settles it,&rdquo; ruefully observed the second mate, &ldquo;another
      Cape Codder, from Hyannis. Cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll stay here for a spell now, hey,
      Cap&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a spell, yes,&rdquo; replied Nat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay here until we get another
      craft to set sail in, and no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another craft? ANOTHER one? Where in time you goin&rsquo; to get her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Build her,&rdquo; said Captain Nat cheerfully. Then, pointing to the row of
      empty houses and the little deserted church, he added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s timber and
      nails&mdash;yes, and cloth, such as &lsquo;tis. If I can&rsquo;t build a boat out of
      them I&rsquo;ll agree to eat the whole settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not have to eat it, for the boat was built. It took them six months
      to build her, and she was a curious-looking vessel when done, but, as the
      skipper said, &ldquo;She may not be a clipper, but she&rsquo;ll sail anywhere, if you
      give her time enough.&rdquo; He had been the guiding spirit of the whole
      enterprise, planning it, laying the keel, burning buildings, to obtain
      nails and iron, hewing trees for the largest beams, showing them how to
      spin ropes from cocoa-nut fiber, improvising sails from the longboat&rsquo;s
      canvas pieced out with blankets and odd bits of cloth from the abandoned
      houses. Even a strip of carpet from the church floor went into the making
      of those sails.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she was done, but Nat was not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never commanded a ship where I couldn&rsquo;t h&rsquo;ist Yankee colors,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and, by the everlastin&rsquo;! I won&rsquo;t now. We&rsquo;ve got to have a flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, from an old pair of blue overalls, a white cotton shirt, and the red
      hangings of the church pulpit, he made a flag and hoisted it to the truck
      of his queer command. They provisioned her, gave her a liberal supply of
      fresh water, and, one morning, she passed through the opening of the
      lagoon out to the deep blue of the Pacific. And, hidden in her captain&rsquo;s
      stateroom under the head of his bunk, was the ten thousand dollars in
      gold. For Nat had sworn to himself, by &ldquo;the everlasting&rdquo; and other oaths,
      to deliver that money to his New York owners safe and, necessary expenses
      deducted of course, untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven weeks the crazy nondescript slopped across the ocean. Fair winds
      helped her and, at last, she entered the harbor of Nukahiva, over twelve
      hundred miles away. And there&mdash;&ldquo;Hammond&rsquo;s luck,&rdquo; the sailors called
      it&mdash;was a United States man-of-war lying at anchor, the first
      American vessel to touch at that little French settlement for five years.
      The boat they built was abandoned and the survivors of the Sea Mist were
      taken on board the man-of-war and carried to Tahiti.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Tahiti Captain Nat took passage on a French bark for Honolulu. Here,
      after a month&rsquo;s wait, he found opportunity to leave for New York on an
      American ship, the Stars and Stripes. And finally, after being away from
      home for two years, he walked into the office of his New York owners,
      deposited their gold on a table, and cheerfully observed, &ldquo;Well, here I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the yarn which Trumet was to hear later on. It filled columns of
      the city papers at the time, and those interested may read it, in all its
      details, in a book written by an eminent author. The tale of a Cape Cod
      sea captain, plucky and resourceful and adequate, as Yankee sea captains
      were expected to be, and were, in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Trumet did not hear the yarn immediately. All that it heard and all
      that it knew was contained in Captain Nat&rsquo;s brief telegram. &ldquo;Arrived
      to-day. Will be home Thursday.&rdquo; That was all, but it was enough, for in
      that dispatch was explosive sufficient to blow to atoms the doctor&rsquo;s plans
      and Keziah&rsquo;s, the great scheme which was to bring happiness to John Ellery
      and Grace Van Horne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker heard it, while on his way to Mrs. Prince&rsquo;s, and, neglecting
      that old lady for the once, he turned his horse and drove as fast as
      possible to the shanty on the beach. Fast as he drove, Captain Zebedee
      Mayo got there ahead of him. Captain Zeb was hitching his white and
      ancient steed to the post as the doctor hove in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mighty!&rdquo; the captain exclaimed, with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
      enough you&rsquo;ve come, doctor. I hated to go in there alone. You&rsquo;ve heard, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, ain&rsquo;t it wonderful! I&rsquo;m tickled all up one side and sorry all down
      t&rsquo;other. Nat&rsquo;s a true-blue feller, and I&rsquo;m glad enough that he ain&rsquo;t shark
      bait; but what about the minister and her? She&rsquo;s promised to Nat, you
      know, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Don&rsquo;t I know! I&rsquo;ve been going over the affair and trying to see a
      way out ever since I heard of the telegram. Tut! tut! I&rsquo;m like you, mighty
      glad Hammond is safe, but it would have spared complications if he had
      stayed wherever he&rsquo;s been for a few months longer. We would have married
      those two in there by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin we would. But he didn&rsquo;t stay. Are you goin&rsquo; to tell Mr. Ellery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. And I hope he hasn&rsquo;t been told. He&rsquo;s getting well fast
      now, but he mustn&rsquo;t be worried, or back he&rsquo;ll go again. We must see Mrs.
      Coffin. Keziah is our main hold. That woman has got more sense than all
      the rest of us put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was Grace, not Keziah, who opened the shanty door in answer to
      their knock. She was pale and greeted them calmly, but it was evident that
      her calmness was the result of sheer will power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in, doctor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Captain Mayo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Parker entered the building, but Captain Zeb remained outside,
      stammering that he cal&rsquo;lated he&rsquo;d better stay where he could keep an eye
      on his horse. This was such a transparent excuse that it would have been
      funny at any other time. No one smiled now, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is Mrs. Coffin&mdash;er&mdash;Keziah aboard?&rdquo; the captain asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t. She went to the parsonage a few hours ago. Mr. Ellis
      brought the mail and there was a letter in it for her. She said it was
      important and that she must go home to see about some things. She&rsquo;ll be
      back pretty soon, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor whispered her name then and she went inside, closing the door
      after her. Captain Zebedee sat down on the step to ponder over the new and
      apparently insurmountable difficulty which had arisen. As he said
      afterwards, &ldquo;The more I tried to get an observation, the thicker it got.
      Blamed if I could see anything but fog, but I could hear&mdash;I could
      hear Elkanah and his gang gigglin&rsquo;, ahead, astern and off both bows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker found his patient sleeping soundly and had not disturbed him.
      Returning to the living room he spoke to Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted, watching her from under his brows, &ldquo;everything seems
      to be all right in there. He hasn&rsquo;t been excited or anything like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. He mustn&rsquo;t be. You understand that? He mustn&rsquo;t be told
      anything that will upset him. He&rsquo;s getting well fast and I want it to
      continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! Er&mdash;have you heard&mdash;Has anyone been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have heard. The telegram came and I answered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? Well, it&rsquo;s a miracle and we&rsquo;re all thankful, of course. Did you&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, I must go home. I mustn&rsquo;t stay here any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know why not. I must be at home when he comes. You must get some one
      to take my place. Aunt Keziah will stay, of course, and perhaps Mrs.
      Higgins would come, or Hannah Poundberry. She&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I know it. I&rsquo;d as soon have a hay-cutter running in here as
      Hannah&rsquo;s tongue. I could stop a hay-cutter when it got too noisy. Well, if
      you must go, you must, I suppose. But stay through tomorrow, at any rate.
      Nat won&rsquo;t get here until Thursday, and I may be able to find another nurse
      by that time. And what I shall say to him,&rdquo; motioning toward the other
      room, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you say anything? Just say that I have been called away for a few
      days on&mdash;on some business. Don&rsquo;t tell him. Don&rsquo;t tell him the truth,
      doctor, now. He is too weak and I am afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and turned away. The doctor watched her pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At any rate, this is only for a little while. When
      the captain knows, if he&rsquo;s the man I take him for, he&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whirled like a flash. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to tell him?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No,
      no! You mustn&rsquo;t. You must promise me you won&rsquo;t. Promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;ll tell him. Telling things is Trumet&rsquo;s specialty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must stop it. No one must tell him&mdash;no one except me. I
      shall tell him, of course. He must hear it from me and not from anyone
      else. He would think I was disloyal and ungrateful&mdash;and I am! I have
      been! But I was&mdash;I COULDN&rsquo;T help it. You know, doctor, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Well, I&rsquo;ll promise, but it will all come out right, you
      see. You mustn&rsquo;t think I&mdash;we&mdash;have been interfering in your
      affairs, Grace. But we&rsquo;ve all come to think a whole lot of that parson of
      ours and what he wanted we wanted him to have, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Thank you very much for all your kindness, and for your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to say much more, but he could not, under the
      circumstances. He stammered a good-by and, with a question concerning Mrs.
      Coffin&rsquo;s whereabouts, went out to join Captain Zeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried the latter anxiously. &ldquo;How is it? What&rsquo;s up? What&rsquo;s the
      next tack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to the parsonage,&rdquo; was the gloomy answer. &ldquo;If anybody can see a
      glimmer in this cussed muddle Keziah Coffin can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was on her knees in her room, beside a trunk, the same trunk she
      had been packing the day of the minister&rsquo;s arrival in Trumet. She was
      working frantically, sorting garments from a pile, rejecting some and
      keeping others. She heard voices on the walk below and went down to admit
      the callers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Keziah?&rdquo; asked Dr. Parker sharply, after a look at her
      face. &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d been through the war. Humph! I suppose you&rsquo;ve
      heard the news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah brushed back the hair from her forehead. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered
      slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s great news, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for&mdash;if things weren&rsquo;t as
      they are, I&rsquo;d be crowing hallelujahs this minute. Trumet has got a good
      man safe and sound again, and the Lord knows it needs all of that kind it
      can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But there&rsquo;s the other matter. I&rsquo;ve been to see Grace. She didn&rsquo;t say
      so, but it was easy enough to see; the man she promised to marry and
      thought was dead, is alive. She&rsquo;s a girl of her word&mdash;she promised
      him and she promised her dying uncle&mdash;and she&rsquo;ll marry him. And then
      what will become of John Ellery? He&rsquo;ll go downhill so fast that a ship&rsquo;s
      anchor wouldn&rsquo;t hold him. If he doesn&rsquo;t die I&rsquo;ll have to send him away
      somewhere, and the Regular church will lose the minister we&rsquo;ve fought so
      hard for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; concurred Zebedee, &ldquo;and them blasted Danielses&rsquo;ll run the shebang
      and the rest of us&rsquo;ll have to sing small, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we&rsquo;ve come to you, Keziah,&rdquo; went on the doctor. &ldquo;Do you see any
      salvation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Nat Hammond. If he knows Grace doesn&rsquo;t want to marry him, do you
      suppose he&rsquo;ll hold her to her promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not so sure. Men don&rsquo;t give up girls like that so easy.
      I wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;by George, I wouldn&rsquo;t! And she won&rsquo;t tell him the whole
      truth, I&rsquo;m afraid. She&rsquo;ll pretend to be glad&mdash;hang it! she IS glad&mdash;to
      have him home again and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s glad. Ain&rsquo;t we all glad and happy and thankful? We ought
      to be. But&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;doctor, you leave this to me. So
      far as John and Grace are concerned you needn&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;ll take it on
      myself to see that they have each other, as the Almighty meant &lsquo;em to.
      Leave it to me. Just leave it to me. I KNOW I can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would not say more, nor tell on what grounds she based her optimism.
      She would go back to the shanty that evening, she said, and stay until the
      following afternoon. Grace would undoubtedly go to the old tavern to
      prepare for the homecoming. Let Mrs. Higgins take her place as nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to leave, myself,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;for a little while; so
      perhaps you&rsquo;d better try to get somebody else to help the Higgins woman.
      Don&rsquo;t ask me any questions, please don&rsquo;t, and be sure not to say a word to
      anybody&mdash;most of all to Grace. Just do as I tell you and leave it to
      me. And don&rsquo;t come and see me again until after&mdash;after he comes home.
      Good-by, doctor. Good-by, Cap&rsquo;n Zeb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with each of them, a rather unusual proceeding as they
      thought of it afterwards. Then they went away and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; mused Parker, as they came out at the gate. &ldquo;Humph! She seems
      sure, doesn&rsquo;t she. And yet she doesn&rsquo;t act like herself. Did you notice
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yup. I noticed it. But I expect Nat&rsquo;s droppin&rsquo; out of the clouds shook
      her up, same as it done the rest of us. Well, never mind. She&rsquo;s a bully
      good, capable woman and what she says she&rsquo;ll do she gen&rsquo;rally does. I&rsquo;m
      bettin&rsquo; on her. By time! I feel better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah Daniels and his friends were feeling better also, and they
      were busy. Trumet had a new hero now. On Wednesday the Boston papers
      printed excerpts from Captain Hammond&rsquo;s story, and these brief preliminary
      accounts aroused the admiration of every citizen. It was proposed to give
      him a reception. Elkanah was the moving spirit in the preparations.
      Captain Nat, so they learned by telegraphing, would arrive on the noon
      train Thursday. His was not to be a prosaic progress by stage all the way
      from Sandwich. A special carriage, drawn by the Daniels span and escorted
      by other vehicles, was to meet the coach at Bayport and bring him to
      Trumet in triumphant procession. All this was to be a surprise, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wednesday afternoon the Daniels following was cheered by the tidings that
      Grace Van Horne had left the beach and was at her old home, the Hammond
      tavern. And Mrs. Poundberry reported her busy as a bee &ldquo;gettin&rsquo; things
      ready.&rdquo; This was encouraging and indicated that the minister had been
      thrown over, as he deserved to be, and that Nat would find his fiancee
      waiting and ready to fulfill her contract. &ldquo;Reg&rsquo;lar whirligig, that girl,&rdquo;
       sniffed Didama Rogers. &ldquo;If she can&rsquo;t have one man she&rsquo;ll take the next,
      and then switch back soon&rsquo;s the wind changes. However, most likely she
      never was engaged to Mr. Ellery, anyhow. He&rsquo;s been out of his head and
      might have said some fool things that let Dr. Parker and the rest b&rsquo;lieve
      he was in love with her. As for pickin&rsquo; of him up and totin&rsquo; him back to
      the shanty that night, that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but common humanity. She
      couldn&rsquo;t let him die in the middle of the lighthouse lane, could she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thursday was a perfect day, and the reception committee was on hand and
      waiting in front of the Bayport post office. The special carriage, the
      span brushed and curried until their coats glistened in the sunshine, was
      drawn up beside the platform. The horses had little flags fastened to
      their bridles, and there were other and larger flags on each side of the
      dashboard. Captain Daniels, imposing in his Sunday raiment, high-collared
      coat, stock, silk hat and gold-headed cane, sat stiffly erect on the seat
      in the rear. The other carriages were alongside, among them Captain
      Zebedee Mayo&rsquo;s ancient chaise, the white horse sound asleep between the
      shafts. Captain Zeb had not been invited to join the escort, but had
      joined it without an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess likely I&rsquo;d better be on hand,&rdquo; the captain confided to Dr.
      Parker. &ldquo;Maybe I can stop Elkanah from talkin&rsquo; too much about&mdash;well,
      about what we don&rsquo;t want him to talk about, and besides, I&rsquo;m just as
      anxious to give Nat a welcome home as the next feller. He&rsquo;s a brick and
      we&rsquo;re all proud of him. By mighty! I&rsquo;d like to have seen that craft he
      built out of cocoanuts and churches&mdash;I would so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan Pepper was there also, not yet fully recovered from the surprise
      which Lavinia&rsquo;s gracious permission had given him. Abishai had been
      leaning disconsolately over his front gate early that morning when Noah
      Ellis, the lightkeeper, jogged down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bish,&rdquo; hailed Noah, pulling up his horse. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?
      You look bluer&rsquo;n a spiled mack&rsquo;rel. What&rsquo;s the row? Breakfast disagree
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; replied Kyan shortly. &ldquo;Where you bound, all rigged up in your shore
      duds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bound to Bayport, to see Nat Hammond land,&rdquo; was the cheerful answer. &ldquo;I
      ain&rsquo;t had a day off I don&rsquo;t know when, and I thought I&rsquo;d take one. Be
      great doin&rsquo;s over there, they tell me. Elkanah&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to make a speech
      and there&rsquo;s eighteen teams of folks goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. I wisht I was goin&rsquo;, too, but I never have no fun. Have to
      stay to home and work and slave over them consarned tax papers. Sometimes
      I wish there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no taxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I&rsquo;ve wished that, myself, more&rsquo;n once. Why don&rsquo;t you go, if you
      want to? Climb right aboard here with me. Plenty of room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey? You mean that? By godfreys mighty! I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartin, I mean it. Come ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pepper sadly shook his head. &ldquo;I guess likely I&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; he
      sighed. &ldquo;Laviny might not like to have me leave her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fiddlesticks! she won&rsquo;t mind. I&rsquo;ll take care of you. It&rsquo;s perfectly
      safe. There ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be no women around. Haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still laughing at his own joke when through the slats of the closed
      blinds shading the Pepper house parlor a shrill voice was heard speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, &lsquo;Bishy dear,&rdquo; called Lavinia. &ldquo;Go ahead and go. A change of
      air&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan whirled and clutched at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HEY?&rdquo; he shouted in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you deef? Or is Mr. Ellis laughin&rsquo; so hard that you can&rsquo;t hear? What
      is it that&rsquo;s so funny, Mr. Ellis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light-keeper shut off his laughter by a sudden and rather frightened
      gulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;, Miss Pepper. Nice day, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. I ain&rsquo;t had time to look at it yet. I have to work. I can&rsquo;t
      let my wife do it for me, like some folks, and take &lsquo;days off.&rsquo; What was
      it you was laughin&rsquo; at, Mr. Ellis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo; at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! They used to tell me there was only one kind of person who laughed
      at nothin&rsquo;. Well, &lsquo;Bish Pepper, what are you standin&rsquo; there for? If you&rsquo;re
      goin&rsquo;, come right into the house and change your clothes this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan obeyed. Shortly he reappeared, clothed like a lily of the field, one
      that had long since gone to seed. He clambered up beside Noah and they
      drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerushy!&rdquo; exclaimed the lightkeeper. &ldquo;This is kind of unexpected, ain&rsquo;t
      it? What&rsquo;s got into her to make her so accommodatin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfreys mighty!&rdquo; was the dazed reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. This as fast as you
      can drive? Hurry up, afore she changes her mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it happened that Mr. Pepper was in Bayport with the rest, awaiting the
      stage which was bringing Trumet&rsquo;s latest celebrity from Sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she comes!&rdquo; shouted Ezra Simmons, the postmaster. &ldquo;Right on time,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough! A cloud of dust in the distance, rising on the spring wind,
      and the rattle of rapidly turning wheels. The reception committee prepared
      for action. Captain Elkanah descended from the carriage and moved in
      stately dignity to the front of the post-office platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum&mdash;ha!&rdquo; he barked, turning to his followers. &ldquo;Be ready now. Give
      him a good cheer, when I say the word. Let it be hearty&mdash;hearty,
      yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stage, its four horses at a trot, swung up to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; roared the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; ordered Elkanah. &ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the committee, its uninvited guests and the accompanying
      crowd of Bayport men and boys which had gathered to assist in the welcome.
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; yelled Kyan, a little behind, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      A passenger or two peered from the coach window. The stage driver
      ironically touched his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank ye very much. I&rsquo;ve been hopin&rsquo; for this for a
      long time, though I&rsquo;d about given up expectin&rsquo; it. I&rsquo;m very much obliged.
      Won&rsquo;t somebody please ask me to make a speech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah frowned his disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are cheering Cap&rsquo;n Nathaniel Hammond of Trumet,&rdquo; he explained
      haughtily. &ldquo;We are here to meet him and escort him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver sighed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I thought my merits had
      been recognized at last. And &lsquo;twas all for Cap&rsquo;n Hammond? Dear! dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He winked at Simmons, who wanted to laugh, but did not dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said Captain Elkanah. &ldquo;Where is he? Where&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Hammond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll tell ye; I don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You DON&rsquo;T? Isn&rsquo;t he with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t. And he didn&rsquo;t come on the train, nuther. He WAS on it. The
      conductor told me he see him and set along with him between stations as
      fur as Cohasset Narrows. But after that he never see hide nor hair of him.
      Oh, that&rsquo;s so! Here&rsquo;s the mail bag, Ezry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah looked at the reception committee and it looked at him.
      Here was a most disconcerting setback for all the plans. The committee,
      after asking more, and fruitless questions, went into executive session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zeb stepped beside the stage and put one foot on the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Thad,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;is that all you know? Where did he go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you, cap&rsquo;n. The conductor says he see him afore they got to
      Cohasset Narrows and not after. Naturally, we s&rsquo;pose he got off there.
      Pretty good joke on old Daniels, I call it. Serve him right, figgerin&rsquo; to
      take a passenger away from me. He, he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do know more, now don&rsquo;t you? Tell a feller&mdash;come! I don&rsquo;t
      like Elkanah any better&rsquo;n you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the driver&rsquo;s voice dropped still lower. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I
      did hear this much, though don&rsquo;t you tell none of them: A chap I know was
      on the train and he said he see Cap&rsquo;n Nat get off the cars at the Cohasset
      Narrows depot and there was a woman with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman? A WOMAN? What woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I know! And he didn&rsquo;t nuther. So long! Git dap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reception committee and its escort drove slowly back to Trumet. The
      Daniels following was disgusted and disappointed. Captain Elkanah had
      figured upon keeping Hammond under his own wing until he was safely
      deposited at the old tavern. Grace was there and Elkanah meant that these
      two should meet before any inkling of Ellery&rsquo;s story reached Nat&rsquo;s ears.
      Incidentally, he could drop a few damaging hints concerning the minister&rsquo;s
      character. To hurt Ellery all he could and prejudice Hammond against him&mdash;that
      was the plan, and now it was frustrated. The captain had not put in an
      appearance and no one knew where he was or when he would come home.
      Obviously, there was nothing to do except give up the reception and await
      further news from the missing man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those present wished to remain in Bayport until night. Another
      train was due in Sandwich and, possibly, Nat might come on that. They
      could telegraph and find out whether or not he did come, and if he did,
      could send a carriage for him. But this suggestion was overruled. The
      reception was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homeward journey had some unpleasant incidents. Several Come-Outers
      had driven over. Nat belonged to them, so they felt&mdash;he was the son
      of their dead founder and leader&mdash;and they determined the Regulars
      should not have him all to themselves. They had come to bid him welcome on
      behalf of the worshipers at the chapel. Now they took advantage of the
      general disappointment to make sarcastic and would-be-humorous remarks
      loud enough for the majestic occupant of the decorated carriage to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Thoph Black, &ldquo;that them flags ought to be ha&rsquo;f mast.
      That craft&rsquo;s in distress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sh-h!&rdquo; counciled his companion, another Come-Outer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      irreverent. Look who&rsquo;s cruisin&rsquo; under &lsquo;em. That&rsquo;s the King of Trumet.
      Let&rsquo;s you and me go ahead and fire salutes, Thoph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Elkanah wrathfully ordered the flags to be removed from the
      horses&rsquo; heads and from the dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Noah Ellis and his passenger turned into the lighthouse lane another
      vehicle turned out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; queried Kyan. &ldquo;Looked like one of the livery stable horses
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. &lsquo;Twas Thankful Payne&rsquo;s and that was her carriage, too. It&rsquo;s
      gettin&rsquo; so dark I couldn&rsquo;t see who was drivin&rsquo; it, but &lsquo;twas a man,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan seemed to be pondering. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I wonder if that
      cousin of hers from Sandwich is here visitin&rsquo;. That Caleb Pratt, seems to
      me his name is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;. I just wondered, that was all. That might explain why
      she let me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;. Good night, Noah. I&rsquo;m much obliged to you for takin&rsquo; me over,
      even if there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trumet spent that evening wondering what had become of Nat Hammond.
      Captain Zeb Mayo wondered most of all. Yet his wonderment was accompanied
      by vague suspicions of the truth. And, at eleven o&rsquo;clock, when the village
      was in bed, a horse and buggy moved down the Turn-off and stopped before
      the Hammond gate. A man alighted from the buggy and walked briskly up to
      the side door. There he knocked and then whistled shrilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A window overhead was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked a feminine voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Gracie,&rdquo; replied the man at the door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&mdash;Nat.
      I&rsquo;ve come home again.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH THE MINISTER RECEIVES A LETTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      John Ellery was uneasy. Physically he was very much better, so much better
      that he was permitted to sit up a while each day. But mentally he was
      disturbed and excited, exactly the condition which the doctor said he must
      not be in. Keziah and Grace had gone away and left him, and he could not
      understand why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higgins, Ike&rsquo;s mother, was at the shanty and she did her best to
      soothe and quiet him. She was a kind soul and capable, in her way, but she
      could not answer his questions satisfactorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Why did they go? Has anything happened?
      When are they coming back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you just when, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Higgins. &ldquo;Grace had
      to go home for a&mdash;a day or so and Keziah had things to attend to at
      the parsonage. Don&rsquo;t you fret yourself about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fretting, but it does seem strange. I could understand why one
      should go, perhaps, but not both. Didn&rsquo;t Gra&mdash;Miss Van Horne tell you
      why she went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, Mr. Ellery, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s worry about Gracie. She&rsquo;s a good girl
      with lots of common sense and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that. But that doesn&rsquo;t answer me. Why did she go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah hadn&rsquo;t been to the parsonage sence that day when you was fust took
      sick, and I expect likely she felt that she&rsquo;d ought to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Mrs. Higgins, tell me the truth. I&rsquo;m not asking about Mrs.
      Coffin. Didn&rsquo;t Miss Van Horne tell you her reason for leaving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know the reason? You&rsquo;re keeping something from me. Did she say
      when she would come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly, but, of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re keeping something from me. What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happened? Land sakes! does anything ever happen in Trumet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a good many things have happened lately. And the longer you keep
      the truth from me the more I shall suspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery, you set still in that chair, or, when the doctor comes, he&rsquo;ll
      put you to bed. I&rsquo;ve got some cookin&rsquo; to do and I can&rsquo;t set here gossipin&rsquo; 
      no longer. You behave yourself and stop frettin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m skipper here now&mdash;er&mdash;for
      a while, anyhow&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve got to take orders from me. There! now I
      cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re scared, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem greatly frightened, nor in awe of his new skipper.
      Instead, he was evidently preparing to ask more questions. Mrs. Higgins
      hurriedly fled to the living room and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister heard her rattling pans and dishes at a great rate. The noise
      made him nervous and he wished she might be more quiet. He moved to the
      chair nearest the window and looked out over the dunes and the wide
      stretch of tumbling blue sea. The surf was rolling up the shore, the
      mackerel gulls were swooping and dipping along the strand, the beach grass
      was waving in the wind. A solitary fish boat was beating out past the spar
      buoy. She was almost over the spot when the San Jose had first anchored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The view was a familiar one. He had seen it in all weathers, during a
      storm, at morning when the sun was rising, at evening when the moon came
      up to tip the watery ridges with frosted silver. He had liked it,
      tolerated it, hated it, and then, after she came, loved it. He had thought
      it the most beautiful scene in all the world and one never to be
      forgotten. The dingy old building, with its bare wooden walls, had been
      first a horror, then a prison, and at last a palace of contentment. With
      the two women, one a second mother to him, and the other dearest of all on
      earth, he could have lived there forever. But now the old prison feeling
      was coming back. He was tired of the view and of the mean little room. He
      felt lonely and deserted and despairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nerves were still weak and it was easy, in his childish condition, to
      become despondent. He went over the whole situation and felt more and more
      sure that his hopes had been false ones and that he had builded a fool&rsquo;s
      paradise. After all, he remembered, she had given him no promise; she had
      found him ill and delirious and had brought him there. She had been kind
      and thoughtful and gracious, but that she would be to anyone, it was her
      nature. And he had been content, weak as he was, to have her near him,
      where he would see her and hear her speak. Her mere presence was so
      wonderful that he had been satisfied with that and had not asked for more.
      And now she had gone. Mrs. Higgins had said &ldquo;for a day or two,&rdquo; but that
      was indefinite, and she had not said she would return when those two days
      had passed. He was better now, almost well. Would she come back to him?
      After all, conditions in the village had not changed. He was still pastor
      of the Regular church and she was a Come-Outer. The man she had promised
      to marry was dead&mdash;yes. But the other conditions were the same. And
      Mrs. Higgins had refused to tell him the whole truth; he was certain of
      that. She had run away when he questioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the chair and started toward the living room. He would not be
      put off again. He would be answered. His hand was on the latch of the door
      when that door was opened. Dr. Parker came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was smiling broadly. His ruddy face was actually beaming. He
      held out his hand, seized the minister&rsquo;s, and shook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a glorious day. Yes, sir, a
      bully day. Hey? isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery&rsquo;s answer was a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why have Mrs. Coffin and&mdash;and Miss Van Horne
      gone? Has anything happened? I know something has, and you must tell me
      what. Don&rsquo;t try to put me off or give me evasive answers. I want to know
      why they have gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Parker looked at him keenly. &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get into
      Mrs. Higgins&rsquo;s wig. I told her not to let you worry, and you have worried.
      You&rsquo;re all of a shake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. I asked you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did. Now, Mr. Ellery, I&rsquo;m disappointed in you. I thought you
      were a sensible man who would take care of his health, now that he&rsquo;d got
      the most of it back again. I&rsquo;ve got news for you&mdash;good news&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;m not sure that I shall tell it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! Dr. Parker, if you&rsquo;ve got news for me that is good, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake tell it. I&rsquo;ve been imagining everything bad that could
      possibly happen. Tell me, quick. My health can stand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, yes, I guess it can. They say joy doesn&rsquo;t kill, and that&rsquo;s one of
      the few medical proverbs made by unmedical men that are true. You come
      with me and sit down in that chair. Yes, you will. Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led his patient back to the chair by the window and forced him into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Ellery, if you think you are a man, a sensible
      man, who won&rsquo;t go to pieces like a ten-year-old youngster, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      let you sit here for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit still. No, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you anything. You sit where you
      are and maybe the news&rsquo;ll come to you. If you move it won&rsquo;t. Going to obey
      orders? Good! I&rsquo;ll see you by and by, Mr. Ellery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked out of the room. It seemed to Ellery that he sat in that chair
      for ten thousand years before the door again opened. And then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;Grace!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;O Grace! you&mdash;you&rsquo;ve come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was blushing red, her face was radiant with quiet happiness, but her
      eyes were moist. She crossed the room, bent over and kissed him on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, John,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back. Yes, dear, I&rsquo;ve come back to&mdash;to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside the shanty, on the side farthest from the light and its group of
      buildings, the doctor and Captain Nat Hammond were talking with Mrs.
      Higgins. The latter was wildly excited and bubbling with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s splendid!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost too fine to believe. Now
      we&rsquo;ll keep our minister, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; observed the doctor, with quiet satisfaction. &ldquo;Zeb
      and I had the Daniels crowd licked to a shoestring and now they&rsquo;ll stay
      licked. The parish committee is three to one for Mr. Ellery and the
      congregation more than that. Keep him? You bet we&rsquo;ll keep him! And I&rsquo;ll
      dance at his wedding&mdash;that is, unless he&rsquo;s got religious scruples
      against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higgins turned to Captain Nat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hard for you, Nat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s awful noble and
      self-sacrificin&rsquo; and everybody&rsquo;ll say so. Of course there wouldn&rsquo;t be much
      satisfaction in havin&rsquo; a wife you knew cared more for another man. But
      still it&rsquo;s awful noble of you to give her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at the doctor and laughed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let my nobility weigh on your mind, Mrs. Higgins,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      made up my mind to do this very thing afore ever I got back to Trumet.
      That is, if Gracie was willin&rsquo;. And when I found she was not only willin&rsquo; 
      but joyful, I&mdash;well, I decided to offer up the sacrifice right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did? You DID? Why, how you talk! I never heard of such a thing in my
      born days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I neither, not exactly. But there!&rdquo; with a wink at Parker, &ldquo;you see
      I&rsquo;ve been off amongst all them Kanaka women and how do you know but I&rsquo;ve
      fell in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat HAMMOND!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I&mdash;What is it, Grace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in the doorway and beckoning to him. Her cheeks were
      crimson, the breeze was tossing her hair about her forehead, and she made
      a picture that even the practical, unromantic doctor appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, Nat!&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got more courage than I have. If
      &lsquo;twas my job to give her up to somebody else I&rsquo;d think twice, I&rsquo;ll bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain went to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;will you come in? He wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John Ellery was still seated in the chair by the window, but he no longer
      looked like an invalid. There was no worry or care in his countenance now,
      merely a wondrous joy and serene happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hands and the captain shook them heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as they used to say at the circus, &lsquo;Here we are
      again.&rsquo; And you and I have been doing all kinds of circus acrobatics since
      we shook last, hey? I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re pretty nigh out of the sick bay&mdash;and
      the doctor says you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; began Ellery. Hammond interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Belay right there. If you and I are to cruise in the
      same family&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what I hear is likely to happen&mdash;I
      cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll heave overboard the cap&rsquo;ns and Misters. My name&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;Nathaniel&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Nat&rsquo; for short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. And mine is &lsquo;John.&rsquo; Captain&mdash;Nat, I mean&mdash;how can I
      ever thank you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me? What do you want to thank me for? I only handed over somethin&rsquo; 
      that wasn&rsquo;t mine in the first place and belonged to you all along. I
      didn&rsquo;t know it, that was the only trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your promise to your father. I feel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t. I told dad that it was just as Grace said. She says she&rsquo;s
      got a better man, or words to that effect. And&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how you
      feel about such things, John&mdash;but I b&rsquo;lieve there&rsquo;s a broader outlook
      up aloft than there is down here and that dad would want me to do just
      what I have done. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; the right thing and I
      know it. And don&rsquo;t pity me, neither. I made up my mind not to marry Grace&mdash;unless,
      of course, she was set on it&mdash;months ago. I&rsquo;m tickled to death to
      know she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to have as good a man as you are. She&rsquo;ll tell you so.
      Grace! Hello! she&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I told her I wanted to talk with you alone, for a few minutes. Nat,
      Grace tells me that Aunt Keziah was the one who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was. She met me at the Cohasset Narrows depot. I was settin&rsquo; in the
      car, lookin&rsquo; out of the window at the sand and sniffin&rsquo; the Cape air. By
      the everlastin&rsquo;! there ain&rsquo;t any air or sand like &lsquo;em anywheres else. I
      feel as if I never wanted to see a palm tree again as long as I live. I&rsquo;d
      swap the whole of the South Pacific for one Trumet sandhill with a
      huckleberry bush on it. Well, as I started to say, I was settin&rsquo; there
      lookin&rsquo; out of the window when somebody tapped me on the shoulder. I
      looked up and &lsquo;twas her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have blown me over with a fan. By the jumpin&rsquo; Moses, you could!
      You see, I&rsquo;d been thinkin&rsquo; about her&mdash;that is, I was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, turned red, coughed, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was surprised enough to see her, I tell you. Way up there at the
      Narrows! I couldn&rsquo;t have said a word, anyway, and she never gave me a
      chance. &lsquo;Nat,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk now. Come with me, quick, afore the
      train starts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I didn&rsquo;t say anything, nothin&rsquo; sane anyhow. &lsquo;Keziah!&rsquo; I managed to
      stutter. &lsquo;KEZIAH!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come!&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Hurry! I want you to get off here. I&rsquo;ve come here on
      purpose to meet you. I must talk with you; it&rsquo;s important. You can go to
      Trumet on the next train, to-night. But now I must talk with you. I MUST.
      Won&rsquo;t you please come, Nat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I went. The engine bell was beginnin&rsquo; to ring and we had to move
      lively, I tell you. I swung her off the step just as the car begun to
      move. After the smoke had faded away around the next bend I realized that
      my hat had faded away along with it. Yes, sir! I&rsquo;d left it on the seat.
      Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed uproariously. Ellery laughed in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t worryin&rsquo; about hats, just then. All I wanted to do was
      stand still, like a frozen image, and stare at her. You see, John, I
      hadn&rsquo;t laid eyes on a friend, one of the real homemade kind, for more days
      than I wanted to count; and here was one of &lsquo;em, one of the best, passed
      out to me unexpected and ahead of time, like a surprise party present. So
      I just pumped her hand up and down and stared. I didn&rsquo;t have any exclusive
      mortgage on the starin&rsquo; by no means, for the depot master and a dozen or
      so loafers was lookin&rsquo; at us with their mouths wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she noticed it, for she says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stay here, Nat. Come in the
      waitin&rsquo; room or somewheres where we can talk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So into the waitin&rsquo; room we went and come to anchor on the settee. Six or
      eight of the loafers settled themselves handy to the door, so&rsquo;s they could
      peek in occasionally. I remember I told one of them not to stretch his
      neck that way &lsquo;cause he might never get it back into shape again and in
      the gunnin&rsquo; season that would be dangerous. &lsquo;Some nearsighted feller might
      take you for a goose,&rsquo; I says. Ho! ho!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, John, we had our talk. Seems she left Trumet Wednesday
      afternoon. Got the livery stable man to drive her as fur as Bayport, hired
      another team there and come on to Sandwich. Stayed overnight there and
      took the mornin&rsquo; train which got to Cohasset Narrows just ahead of the one
      I was comin&rsquo; on. She&rsquo;d been so afraid of bein&rsquo; late, she said. She must
      see me afore I got to Trumet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she saw me and told me the whole yarn about you and Grace. She
      tried to break it to me gently, so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel too bad. She knew it
      would be a shock to me, she said. It was a shock, in a way, but as for
      feelin&rsquo; bad, I didn&rsquo;t. I think the world of Grace. I&rsquo;d do anything she
      wanted me to do; but most the way down on the train&mdash;yes, and long
      afore that&mdash;I&rsquo;d been dreadin&rsquo; my comin&rsquo; home on one account. I
      dreaded tellin&rsquo; her that, unless she was real set on it, she&rsquo;d better not
      marry me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, John, I&rsquo;ve thought a lot sence I&rsquo;ve been away. Had consider&rsquo;ble
      time to do it in. And the more I thought the less that promise to dad
      seemed right. I&rsquo;d have bet my sou-wester Gracie never cared for me in the
      way a girl ought to care for a chap she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to ship as pilot for the
      rest of her days. And, as for me&mdash;well, I&mdash;I had my reasons for
      not wantin&rsquo; to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, sighed, started to speak, and then sat silent, looking
      out of the window. Ellery laid a hand on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; said the minister, &ldquo;you saved my life once, do you remember that? I
      do, if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved your life? What are you talkin&rsquo; about? Oh! that time on the flats?
      That wasn&rsquo;t savin&rsquo; your life, &lsquo;twas savin&rsquo; your clothes from gettin&rsquo; a
      wettin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was more than that. And now I guess you&rsquo;ve saved it again, you and
      Grace between you. Yes, and Aunt Keziah. Bless her! to think of her going
      way up there to meet you and help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. &lsquo;Twas like her, wasn&rsquo;t it? She said she knew I&rsquo;d hear the yarn when
      I got to Trumet, but she wanted me to hear it just as it was, and nobody
      but she and Grace and you knew the whole truth about it. So she come. I&rsquo;m
      glad she did; not that I shouldn&rsquo;t have done the same, whoever told me,
      but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat, I want to tell you something. Something that only one other person
      knows. Grace doesn&rsquo;t know it yet. Neither does Aunt Keziah&mdash;the whole
      of it. And if she knew I told you even a part I&rsquo;m afraid she would, as she
      would say, &lsquo;skin me alive.&rsquo; But I owe her&mdash;and you&mdash;more than I
      could repay if I lived a thousand years. So I&rsquo;m going to tell and take the
      consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at him. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; now? More
      secrets? Blessed if this ain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; more excitin&rsquo; than the South Seas.
      I used to think excitement in Trumet was scurcer than cream in poorhouse
      coffee, but I&rsquo;ll have to change my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat, when&mdash;that morning after your father died and after you and
      Grace had agreed to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do somethin&rsquo; neither of us wanted to do? Yes, I know. Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That morning Aunt Keziah came home to the parsonage and broke the news to
      me. She did it as only she could do such a thing, kindly and pityingly and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. That&rsquo;s Keziah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, as you can imagine, I was almost crazy. I made a fool of
      myself, I expect; refused to believe her, behaved disgracefully, and at
      last, when I had to believe it, threatened to run away and leave my work
      and Trumet forever, like a coward. She made me stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She showed me it was my duty to face the music. When I whimpered
      about my troubles she told me her own story. Then I learned what trouble
      was and what pluck was, too. She told me about her marriage and&mdash;excuse
      me for speaking of what isn&rsquo;t my business; yet it is mine, in a way&mdash;she
      told me about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hammond did not answer. His good natured face clouded and he
      shifted in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me of you, Nat, all about you&mdash;and herself. And she told me
      something else, which explains why she felt she must send you away, why
      she thought your marriage to Grace would be a good thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. She told you that that darn scamp Anse Coffin was alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister started violently. He gasped in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew it? You KNEW it?&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it now. Have known it for over a year. My findin&rsquo; it out was one
      of the special Providences that&rsquo;s been helpin&rsquo; along this last voyage of
      mine. My second mate was a Hyannis man, name of Cahoon. One day, on that
      pesky island, when we was eatin&rsquo; dinner together, he says to me, &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; 
      he says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re from Trumet, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; I owned up. &lsquo;Know anybody named
      Coffin there?&rsquo; says he. I owned up to that, too. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I met
      her husband last trip I was in the Glory of the Wave.&rsquo; I stared at him.
      &lsquo;Met his ghost, you mean,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been dead for years, and a good
      thing, too. Fell overboard and, not bein&rsquo; used to water, it killed him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he wouldn&rsquo;t have it so. &lsquo;I used to know Anse Coffin in New Bedford,&rsquo; 
      he says. &lsquo;Knew him well&rsquo;s I know you. And when we was in port at Havre I
      dropped in at a gin mill down by the water front and he come up and
      touched me on the arm. I thought same as you, that he was dead, but he
      wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. He was three sheets in the wind and a reg&rsquo;lar dock rat to look at,
      but &lsquo;twas him sure enough. We had a long talk. He said he was comin&rsquo; back
      to Trumet some day. Had a wife there, he said. I told him, sarcastic, that
      she&rsquo;d be glad to see him. He laughed and said maybe not, but that she knew
      he was alive and sent him money when he was hard up. Wanted me to promise
      not to tell any Cape folks that I&rsquo;d seen him, and I ain&rsquo;t till now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can imagine how I felt when Cahoon spun me that yarn. First I
      wouldn&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve it and then I did. It explained things, just as you say,
      John. I could see now why Keziah gave me my walkin&rsquo; papers. I could see
      how she&rsquo;d been sacrificin&rsquo; her life for that scum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She wouldn&rsquo;t divorce him. She said she had taken him for better or
      worse, and must stand by him. I tried to show her she was wrong, but it
      was no use. She did say she would never live with him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not. LIVE with him! By the everlastin&rsquo;! if he ever comes
      within reach of my hands then&mdash;there&rsquo;s times when good honest murder
      is justifiable and righteous, and it&rsquo;ll be done. It&rsquo;ll be done, you hear
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked as if he meant it. Ellery asked another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell her&mdash;Aunt Keziah&mdash;when you met her at the
      Narrows?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I shall tell her when I see her again. She shan&rsquo;t spoil her life&mdash;a
      woman like that! by the Lord! WHAT a woman!&mdash;for any such crazy
      notion. I swore it when I heard the story and I&rsquo;ve sworn it every day
      since. That&rsquo;s what settled my mind about Grace. Keziah Coffin belongs to
      me. She always has belonged to me, even though my own pig-headedness lost
      her in the old days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cares for you, Nat. I know that. She as much as told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, John. Thank you. Well, I can wait now. I can wait, for I&rsquo;ve
      got something sure to wait for. I tell you, Ellery, I ain&rsquo;t a church-goin&rsquo; 
      man&mdash;not as dad was, anyway&mdash;but I truly believe that this thing
      is goin&rsquo; to come out right. God won&rsquo;t let that cussed rascal live much
      longer. He won&rsquo;t! I know it. But if he does, if he lives a thousand years,
      I&rsquo;ll take her from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pacing the floor now, his face set like granite. Ellery rose, his
      own face beaming. Here was his chance. At last he could pay to this man
      and Keziah a part of the debt he owed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat stopped in his stride. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I almost forgot, after
      all. Keziah sent a note to you. I&rsquo;ve got it in my pocket. She gave it to
      me when she left me at Cohasset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left you? Why! didn&rsquo;t she come back with you on the night train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s funny, too, and I don&rsquo;t understand it yet. We was together all
      the afternoon. &lsquo;I was feelin&rsquo; so good at seein&rsquo; her that I took her under
      my wing and we cruised all over that town together. Got dinner at the
      tavern and she went with me to buy myself a new hat, and all that. At
      first she didn&rsquo;t seem to want to, but then, after I&rsquo;d coaxed a while, she
      did. She was lookin&rsquo; pretty sad and worn out, when I first met her, I
      thought; but she seemed to get over it and we had a fine time. It reminded
      me of the days when I used to get home from a voyage and we were together.
      Then, when &lsquo;twas time for the night train we went down to the depot. She
      gave me this note and told me to hand it to you to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Good-by, Nat,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve had a nice day, haven&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We have, for a fact,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;But what are you sayin&rsquo; good-by for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to Trumet with you,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to the
      city. I&rsquo;ve got some business to see to there. Good-by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was set back, with all my canvas flappin&rsquo;. I told her I&rsquo;d go to Boston
      with her and we&rsquo;d come home to Trumet together to-morrow, that&rsquo;s to-day.
      But she said no. I must come here and ease your mind and Grace&rsquo;s. I must
      do it. So at last I agreed to, sayin&rsquo; I&rsquo;d see her in a little while. She
      went on the up train and I took the down one. Hired a team in Sandwich and
      another in Bayport and got to the tavern about eleven. That&rsquo;s the yarn.
      And here&rsquo;s your note. Maybe it tells where she&rsquo;s gone and why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister took the note and tore open the envelope. Within was a single
      sheet of paper. He read a few lines, stopped, and uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellery did not answer. He read the note through and then, without a word,
      handed it to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR JOHN:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going away, as I told you I would if he came. He is coming. Tuesday
      I got a letter from him. It was written at Kingston, Jamaica, almost three
      months ago. I can&rsquo;t think why I haven&rsquo;t got it sooner, but suppose it was
      given to some one to mail and forgotten. In it he said he was tired of
      going to sea and was coming home to me. I had money, he said, and we could
      get along. He had shipped aboard a brig bound for Savannah, and from there
      he was going to try for a berth on a Boston-bound vessel. So I am going
      away and not coming back. I could not stand the disgrace and I could not
      see him. You and Grace won&rsquo;t need me any more now. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. I
      can always earn a living while I have my strength. Please don&rsquo;t worry. If
      he comes tell him I have gone you do not know where. That will be true,
      for you don&rsquo;t. I hope you will be very happy. I do hope so. Oh, John, you
      don&rsquo;t know how I hate to do this, but I must. Don&rsquo;t tell Nat. He would do
      something terrible to him if he came, and Nat knew. Just say I have been
      called away and may be back some time. Perhaps I may. Love to you all.
      Good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;KEZIAH COFFIN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain stared at the note. Then he threw it to the floor and started
      for the door. The minister sprang from his chair and called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Nat! Stop! where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hammond turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;Goin&rsquo;? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to find her, first of all. Then I&rsquo;m
      comin&rsquo; back to wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t have to wait. He&rsquo;ll never come. He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? DEAD? By the everlastin&rsquo;! this has been too much for you, I ought
      to have known it. I&rsquo;ll send the doctor here right off. I can&rsquo;t stay
      myself. I&rsquo;ve got to go. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! listen to me! Ansel Coffin is dead, I tell you. I know it. I know
      all about it. That was what I wanted to see you about. Did Keziah tell you
      of the San Jose and the sailor who died of smallpox in this very building?
      In that room there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. John, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not raving. It&rsquo;s the truth. That sailor was Ansel Coffin. I watched
      with him and one night, the night before he died, he spoke Keziah&rsquo;s name.
      He spoke of New Bedford and of Trumet and of her, over and over again. I
      was sure who he was then, but I called in Ebenezer Capen, who used to know
      Coffin in New Bedford. And he recognized him. Nat, as sure as you and I
      are here this minute, Ansel Coffin, Aunt Keziah&rsquo;s husband, is buried in
      the Trumet cemetery.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH MR. STONE WASHES HIS HANDS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Abner Stone, of Stone &amp; Barker, marine outfitters and ship
      chandlers, with a place of business on Commercial Street in Boston, and a
      bank account which commanded respect throughout the city, was feeling
      rather irritable and out of sorts. Poor relations are always a nuisance.
      They are forever expecting something, either money&mdash;in Mr. Stone&rsquo;s
      case this particular expectation was usually fruitless&mdash;or employment
      or influence or something. Mr. Stone was rich, he had become so by his own
      ability and unaided effort. He was sure of that&mdash;often mentioned it,
      with more or less modesty, in the speeches which he delivered to his
      Sunday-school class and at the dinners of various societies to which he
      belonged. He was a self-made man and was conscious that he had done a good
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, being self-made, he saw no particular reason why he should aid
      in the making of others. If people were poor they ought to get over it.
      Poverty was a disease and he was no doctor. He had been poor once himself,
      and no one had helped him. &ldquo;I helped myself,&rdquo; he was wont to say, with
      pride. Some of his rivals in business, repeating this remark, smiled and
      added that he had been &ldquo;helping himself&rdquo; ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stone had &ldquo;washed his hands&rdquo; of his cousin, Keziah Coffin, or thought
      he had. After her brother Solomon died she had written to him, asking him
      to find her a position of some kind in Boston. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want money, I
      don&rsquo;t want charity,&rdquo; wrote Keziah. &ldquo;What I want is work. Can you get it
      for me, Abner? I write to you because father used to tell of what you said
      to him about gratitude and how you would never rest until you had done
      something in return for what he did for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Ben Hall&rsquo;s kindness was the one thing Mr. Stone forgot when he
      said no one had ever helped him. He disliked to be reminded of it. It was
      a long while ago and the captain was dead. However, being reminded, he had
      called upon a friend in the tailoring line and had obtained for Keziah the
      place of sewing woman. She decided to become housekeeper at the Trumet
      parsonage and so notified him. Then he washed his hands of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he was compelled to soil them again. Keziah had appeared at his
      office, without warning, and demanded that he find her a position.
      &ldquo;Demanded&rdquo; was the proper word. Certainly she had not begged. She seemed
      to feel that her demand was right and proper, and his acceding to it the
      least he could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine place you&rsquo;ve got here, Abner!&rdquo; she said, inspecting the
      office and the store. &ldquo;I declare it&rsquo;s finer than the one you had when you
      first went into business, afore you failed. I wish father could have lived
      to see it. He&rsquo;d have realized that his judgment was good, even though his
      investment wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Hall had invested largely in that first business, the one which
      failed. Mr. Stone changed the subject. Later in the day he again sought
      his friend, the tailor, and Keziah was installed in the loft of the
      latter&rsquo;s Washington Street shop, beside the other women and girls who
      sewed and sewed from seven in the morning until six at night. Mr. Stone
      had left her there and come away, feeling that an unpleasant matter was
      disposed of. He had made some inquiries as to where she intended staying,
      even added a half-hearted invitation to dinner that evening at his home.
      But she declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Abner,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to find a boardin&rsquo; place and
      I&rsquo;d just as soon nobody knew where I was stayin&rsquo;, for the present. And
      there&rsquo;s one thing I want to ask you: don&rsquo;t tell a soul I am here. Not a
      soul. If anyone should come askin&rsquo; for me, don&rsquo;t give &lsquo;em any
      satisfaction. I&rsquo;ll tell you why some day, perhaps. I can&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what troubled Mr. Stone as he sat in his office. Why should this
      woman wish to have her whereabouts kept a secret? There was a reason for
      this, of course. Was it a respectable reason, or the other kind? If the
      latter, his own name might be associated with the scandal. He wished, for
      the fiftieth time, that there were no poor relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy came into the office. &ldquo;There is some one here to see you, Mr.
      Stone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. Looks like a seafaring man, a sea captain, I should
      say&mdash;but he won&rsquo;t give his name. Says it&rsquo;s important and nobody but
      you&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! All right. Tell him to wait. I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sea captains and ship owners were Stone &amp; Barker&rsquo;s best customers. The
      senior partner emerged from the office with a smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, extending his hand. &ldquo;Glad to see you, Captain&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hammond,&rdquo; replied the visitor. &ldquo;Same to you, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine weather for this time of year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine enough, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain Hammond, what can we do for you? Going to sail soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not right away. Just made port, less&rsquo;n a week ago. Home looks good to me,
      for a spell, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Yes, I have no doubt. Let me see&mdash;where is your home, captain? I
      should remember, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know why you should. This is my first trip in your latitude, I
      guess. My home&rsquo;s at Trumet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trumet?&rdquo; Mr. Stone&rsquo;s tone changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Trumet, down on the Cape. Ever been there? We think it&rsquo;s about as
      good a place as there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hu-u-m! Trumet? Well, Captain Hammond, you wished to see me, I
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Fact is, Mr. Stone, I want to ask you where I can find Mrs. Keziah
      Coffin. She&rsquo;s a relation of yours, I b&rsquo;lieve, and she&rsquo;s come to Boston
      lately. Only yesterday or the day afore. Can you tell me where she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you wish to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for reasons, personal ones. She&rsquo;s a friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. No, captain, I can&rsquo;t tell you where she is. Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nat was greatly disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there, just a minute,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;This is important, you
      understand, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;m mighty anxious to find Kezi&mdash;Mrs. Coffin.
      We thought, some of her friends and I, that most likely you&rsquo;d know where
      she was. Can&rsquo;t you give us any help at all? Hasn&rsquo;t she been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Captain Hammond. You must excuse me, I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the office and closed the door. Captain Nat rubbed his
      forehead desperately. He had been almost sure that Abner Stone would put
      him on Keziah&rsquo;s track. Grace had thought so, too. She remembered what the
      housekeeper had told concerning her Boston cousin and how the latter had
      found employment for her when she contemplated leaving Trumet, after her
      brother&rsquo;s death. Grace believed that Keziah would go to him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nat walked to the door and stood there, trying to think what to do next. A
      smart young person, wearing a conspicuous suit of clothes, aided and
      abetted by a vivid waistcoat and a pair of youthful but promising side
      whiskers, came briskly along the sidewalk and stopped in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; observed this person, with cheerful condescension. &ldquo;Anything
      I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nat turned his gaze upon the side whiskers and the waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shook his head. &ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; he drawled dryly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,
      son. I admit that don&rsquo;t seem scarcely possible, but I am afraid it&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for something in our line, was you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. What might be on your line&mdash;clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bewhiskered one drew himself up. &ldquo;I am connected with Stone &amp;
      Barker,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;And, seeing you standing in our doorway, I
      thought possibly&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Beg your pardon, I&rsquo;m sure. No, I don&rsquo;t want to buy anything. I
      come to see Mr. Stone on a personal matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s busy, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled with serene satisfaction. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; he
      observed complacently. &ldquo;We ARE a busy house, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hammond&rsquo;s my name. Are you Mr. Barker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, my name is Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? Silent partner in the firm, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o, not exactly.&rdquo; Mr. Prince was slightly embarrassed. &ldquo;No, I am a&mdash;a
      salesman&mdash;at present. Was the matter you wished to see Mr. Stone
      about a very private one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middlin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I asked because Mr. Stone is a busy man and we like to save him all
      the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble you can, hey? That&rsquo;s nice of you, you must save him a lot, Mr&mdash;er&mdash;King,
      was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure and sartin&rsquo;, Prince, of course. I knew &lsquo;twas connected with the
      royal family. Well, Mr. Prince, I&rsquo;m afraid even you can&rsquo;t help me nor him
      out this time. I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; up a friend of mine, a widow lady from down the
      Cape. She&rsquo;s a relation of Mr. Stone&rsquo;s, and she&rsquo;s come to Boston durin&rsquo; the
      last day or so. I thought likely he might know where she was, that&rsquo;s all.
      That would be a little out of your latitude, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Her name wasn&rsquo;t Coffin, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Nat started. &ldquo;It certainly was,&rdquo; he answered eagerly. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you
      know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prince&rsquo;s complacence was superb. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he answered with condescension,
      &ldquo;Mr. Stone trusts me with a good many of his personal affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think likely he would. But about Mrs. Coffin? You was goin&rsquo; to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is with James Hallett &amp; Co., the tailors, on Washington Street.
      Mr. Stone found a place for her there, I believe. I&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;superintended
      the carrying of her valise and&mdash;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo;. Hum! Hallett &amp; Co., tailors? What number Washin&rsquo;ton
      Street did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prince gave the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you a lot,&rdquo; said Captain Nat, with fervor. &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Prince.
      Hope the next time I come you&rsquo;ll be in the firm. Good day, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day. Nothing else I can do? And you won&rsquo;t wait for Mr. Stone? Very
      good. Is there any message for him that you would like to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; Nat had started to go, but now he paused and turned. There was a
      grim twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;Message?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Why, ye-es, I don&rsquo;t know
      but there is. You just give Mr. Stone Cap&rsquo;n Hammond&rsquo;s compliments and tell
      him I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo; forward to interviewin&rsquo; him some time. Just tell him that,
      will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him. Glad to have met you, Captain Hammond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded solemnly. &ldquo;Say, Mr. King,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t half so
      glad as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prince strutted into the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that chap you were talking with?&rdquo; asked a fellow-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a hayseed who wanted to see the old man. Poor relation, I guess. I
      headed him off. Stone is always telling us that time is money, so I saved
      both of &lsquo;em for him. He ought to thank me. Wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I got
      the raise I&rsquo;ve been asking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prince did not get the raise, nor the thanks. But he was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the workshop of Hallett &amp; Co., Keziah sat sewing busily. The window
      near her was closed, stuck fast, and through the dingy panes she could see
      only roofs and chimneys. The other women and girls near her chatted and
      laughed, but she was silent. She did not feel like talking, certainly not
      like laughing. The garment she was at work on was a coat, a wedding coat,
      so the foreman had told her, with a smile; therefore she must be very
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered idly whose coat it might be and who its future wearer was to
      marry. This reminded her of the minister and Grace. They would be happy
      now, her talk with Nat had assured her of that, and they, too, would be
      married one of these days. But she would not attend the wedding. She
      wondered what John had said when he read her note. He and Grace would be
      sorry for her, of course; but there was nothing they could do to help. No
      one could help her, no one. Perhaps by this time the man she had run away
      from had reached Trumet and her secret was known. How Didama and the rest
      would spread the tale! How Captain Elkanah and Annabel would sneer and
      exult! They hated her because she was the minister&rsquo;s friend. And Nat, poor
      fellow, what would he do? Well, at least he would understand now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The narrow stairway leading up to the workshop ended in a little boxed-in
      room where the finished garments were hung to await the final pressing.
      From behind the closed door of this room came the sound of voices,
      apparently in heated argument. One of these voices was that of Larry, the
      errand boy. Larry was speaking shrilly and with emphasis. The other voice
      was lower in key and the words were inaudible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared Larry. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, I tell you. The boss
      don&rsquo;t let nobody in there and&mdash;Hold on! Hold on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other voice made a short but evidently earnest answer. Larry again
      expostulated. The workers looked up from their sewing. The door opened and
      Larry appeared, flushed and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Upham?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Mr. Upham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upham was the foreman of the workroom. At the moment he was downstairs in
      conversation with the head of the house. A half dozen gave this
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Who is it?&rdquo; asked several.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who &lsquo;tis. It&rsquo;s a man and he&rsquo;s crazy, I think. I told him he
      couldn&rsquo;t come in here, but he just keeps comin&rsquo;. He wants to see somebody
      named Coffin and there ain&rsquo;t no Coffins here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah bent lower over the wedding coat. Her hand shook and she dropped
      the needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him we didn&rsquo;t keep coffins,&rdquo; declared Larry. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no
      undertaker&rsquo;s. Where&rsquo;s Mr. Upham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah&rsquo;s nearest neighbor leaned toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s somebody to see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your name is Coffin, ain&rsquo;t
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. That is, it can&rsquo;t be anybody to see me. I don&rsquo;t want to see
      anybody. Tell him so, whoever it is. I can&rsquo;t see anybody. I&mdash;NAT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the doorway, beckoning to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come here. I want you. I&rsquo;ll tell you why in a minute.
      Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. In a measure she was relieved, for she had feared the man
      at the door might be her husband. But she was greatly agitated and
      troubled. Everyone in the place was looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; she said, trying to speak firmly, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see you now. I&rsquo;m very
      busy. Please go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come. Go away. Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah, I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo;. And I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to wait if I stay here all night.
      Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed then. She could not have a scene there, before all those
      strangers. She stepped past him into the little room. He followed and
      closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat,&rdquo; she said, turning to him, &ldquo;why did you come? How could you be so
      cruel? I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her, but not with words. The next moment his arms were
      about her and she was pressed tight against the breast of his blue jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to take you home. Home for good. No,
      stay where you are and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Praise be to God! we&rsquo;re
      off the rocks at last. All that&rsquo;s left is to tow you into port, and, by
      the everlastin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Upham came up the stairs after his long interview with &ldquo;the boss,&rdquo; he
      found the door at the top closed. When he rattled the latch that door was
      opened by a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Mr. Hallett?&rdquo; asked Captain Nat briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. Mr. Hallett is in his office on the first floor. But what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the main deck, hey? Well, all right; we won&rsquo;t trouble him. You&rsquo;ll do
      just as well; I judge you&rsquo;re one of the mates of this craft. You tell Mr.
      Hallett that this lady here has decided not to cruise with him any longer.
      No fault to find, you understand, but she&rsquo;s got a better berth. She&rsquo;s
      goin&rsquo; to ship along with me. Ain&rsquo;t that so, Keziah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah, pale, trembling, scarcely realizing the situation even yet, did
      not speak. But Captain Nat Hammond seemed to find his answer in her
      silence. A few minutes later, her arm in his, they descended the gloomy,
      dusty stairs, and emerged into the sunshine together.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Mr. Abner Stone again &ldquo;washed his hands&rdquo; of his poor
      relation&mdash;this time, as he indignantly declared, &ldquo;for good and all.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN WHICH KEZIAH&rsquo;S PARSON PREACHES ONCE MORE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Time has wrought many changes in Trumet. The packet long since ceased to
      ply between the village and Boston, the stage has been superseded by the
      locomotive, the old &ldquo;square-riggers,&rdquo; commanded by Cape Cod men, no longer
      sail the seas. Along the main road the houses have changed hands. Didama
      Rogers peers no more from her parlor window; that parlor is now profaned
      by the frivolous and irreverent summer boarder. But the old residents love
      to talk of the days that are gone and if you happen to catch Mr. Isaac
      Higgins, now postmaster and a dignified member of the board of selectmen,
      in a reminiscent mood he will very likely tell you of the meeting of the
      parish committee called by its chairman, Elkanah Daniels, to oust the Rev.
      John Ellery from the pulpit of the Regular church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget,&rdquo; says Mr. Higgins, &ldquo;that parish committee meetin&rsquo; if I
      live a thousand year. I, and two or three other young shavers, was hid in
      the little room off the vestry&mdash;the room where they kept the dishes
      they used for church suppers&mdash;and we heard the whole business. Of
      course nobody knew that Nat was goin&rsquo; to marry Keziah then, but they did
      know that he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to marry Grace Van Horne, and had given her up
      to the minister of his own accord. So Daniels&rsquo;s guns was spiked and he
      didn&rsquo;t stand no chance at all. However, you&rsquo;d never have guessed it to
      look at him. He marched into that meetin&rsquo; and up to the platform as stiff
      and dignified as if he&rsquo;d swallered a peck of starch. He called the meetin&rsquo; 
      to order&mdash;&lsquo;twas a full one, for all hands and the cook was there&mdash;and
      then got up to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He opened fire right off. He raked John Ellery fore and aft. The parson,
      he said, had disgraced the society and his sacred profession and should be
      hove overboard immediate. &lsquo;Twas an open secret, he said. Everybody knew
      how he, minister of a Reg&rsquo;lar church, had been carryin&rsquo; on with a
      Come-Outer girl, meetin&rsquo; her unbeknownst to anyone, and so on. As he got
      warmed up on this subject he got more bitter and, though he didn&rsquo;t come
      out open and say slanderous things, his hints was as nigh that as a pig&rsquo;s
      snout is to his squeal. Even through the crack of the dish-closet door I
      could see the bristles risin&rsquo; on the back of Cap&rsquo;n Zeb Mayo&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last Cap&rsquo;n Zeb couldn&rsquo;t stand it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Belay there!&rsquo; he sings out, jumpin&rsquo; to his feet. &lsquo;I want to ask you one
      question, Elkanah Daniels: Are you tryin&rsquo; to say somethin&rsquo; against Grace
      Van Horne&rsquo;s character?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was a sort of sticker, in a way, and I cal&rsquo;late Daniels
      realized it. He &lsquo;hum-ha&rsquo;d&rsquo; and barked a little and then give in that he
      couldn&rsquo;t swear the Van Horne person&rsquo;s character wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all right, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t swear!&rsquo; snorts Zeb. &lsquo;You better not try to, not when the
      minister or Nat&rsquo;s around. Aw, belay! you want us to fire John Ellery out
      of this society&mdash;the best minister it ever had or ever will have&mdash;because
      he had the sense to get sweet on a good clean girl and the spunk to ask
      her to marry him. And you&rsquo;re down on her because she&rsquo;s been brought up in
      a Come-Outer family&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s the reason you give out, though
      some of us have suspicions &lsquo;tain&rsquo;t the real one. Why! she risked what she
      thought was smallpox to keep him from dyin&rsquo; that night she picked him up,
      ravin&rsquo; distracted, in the middle of the lighthouse lane, and if he hadn&rsquo;t
      married her after that I, for one, would have been willin&rsquo; to vote to give
      him his walkin&rsquo; papers, Come-Outer she may have been, but, by time, she&rsquo;s
      got religion that&rsquo;s good enough for me and I&rsquo;ll be proud to see her the
      wife of my minister. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have no more chin music. We know what you
      want and what you called this meetin&rsquo; for; now let&rsquo;s vote on it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four sung out &lsquo;Question&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vote.&rsquo; But Elkanah held up his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;before I ask for the vote I want to say just one
      word. I&rsquo;ve worshiped in this meetin&rsquo; house ever sence I was a child. I was
      christened in it; my father worshiped here afore me; I&rsquo;ve presided over
      the meetin&rsquo;s of this body for years. But I tell you now that if you vote
      to keep that rascally hypocrite in your pulpit I shall resign from the
      committee and from the society. It&rsquo;ll be like cuttin&rsquo; off my right hand,
      but I shall do it. Are you ready for the vote? Those in favor of retaining
      the present minister of this parish will rise. Those opposed will remain
      seated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man on the floor stood up. Daniels himself was the only one that
      stayed settin&rsquo; down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is a vote,&rsquo; says he, white as a sheet, and his voice trembling.
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, I bid you good day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took up his hat and cane, give one look around the vestry, as if he
      was sayin&rsquo; good-by to it, and marched down the aisle as straight and
      starchy as he&rsquo;d come into it. Only, when he reached the door, he put up
      one hand as if he was steadyin&rsquo; himself. There was precious few in that
      vestry that liked Elkanah Daniels, but I&rsquo;m bettin&rsquo; high there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a one
      who didn&rsquo;t feel sorry for him then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twas quiet as could be for a minute or so after he&rsquo;d gone. Then Cap&rsquo;n
      Zeb draws a big breath and flings up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Shipmates,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;this is the Almighty&rsquo;s house and we&rsquo;ve got to do
      it quiet, but I propose three whisperin&rsquo; cheers for the Rev. John Ellery
      and the lady that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be his wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they give &lsquo;em&mdash;hearty, too, if they was whispered&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;s all there is to that meetin&rsquo; worth tellin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Daniels and his daughter moved to Boston that summer. They never
      came back to Trumet to live. Annabel remained single until after her
      father&rsquo;s death; then she married a man very much younger and poorer than
      she was. It was remarked by acquaintances of the couple that the
      difference in age became less and less apparent as their married life
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; observed Captain Zeb, summing up the situation, &ldquo;he started about
      ten year astern, but he&rsquo;ll beat her on the run into the cemetery, now you
      mark my words. Annabel&rsquo;s temper&rsquo;s cal&rsquo;lated to keep any average chap
      drivin&rsquo; on that course, bows under. There&rsquo;s a three-reef breeze blowin&rsquo; 
      off her tongue, day and night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a Sunday morning, a few weeks after the committee meeting, the Regular
      church was crowded. John Ellery was to preach his first sermon since the
      San Jose came ashore. Every member of the congregation was present. Even
      Mrs. Prince, feeble but garrulous, was there. Gaius Winslow, having
      delivered his brood of children at the church door, made a special trip in
      his carryall to fetch the old lady. Captain Zebedee and Mrs. Mayo beamed
      from their pew. Dr Parker and his wife smiled at them across the aisle.
      Didama Rogers&rsquo;s new bonnet was a work of art and her neck threatened to
      twist itself off as she turned to see each one who came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lavinia Pepper sailed to the front. She was dressed in a new black alpaca
      which rustled so very much like silk that nearsighted people might have
      been deceived by it. With her was a man, apparently suffering from
      strangulation because of the height and tightness of his collar. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      Caleb Pratt, from Sandwich,&rdquo; whispered Didama. &ldquo;Thankful Payne&rsquo;s relation,
      you know. Have you heard what folks are sayin&rsquo;? I guess it&rsquo;s true, because&mdash;Look
      at Kyan! you&rsquo;d think he was goin&rsquo; to his own funeral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Abishai&rsquo;s expression was not cheerful, certainly. He followed Mr. Pratt
      and his sister to the Pepper pew and subsided sadly in the corner next the
      wall. Occasionally he was observed to wipe his forehead and once&mdash;it
      was during the prayer&mdash;he groaned audibly. Lavinia&rsquo;s dig in the ribs
      prevented his repeating the sound, but, judging by his looks, he continued
      to groan in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir at the door. All heads swung in that direction&mdash;all
      but Mr. Pepper&rsquo;s, that is. The minister and Grace were coming up the aisle
      and behind them came Captain Nat Hammond and Keziah Coffin. Nat was
      smiling and self-possessed. Never before in his life had he entered the
      Regular meeting house as a worshiper, but he seemed to be bearing the
      ordeal bravely. It was Grace&rsquo;s first visit to the church, also, and she
      was plainly embarrassed. To be stared at by eighty-odd pairs of eyes, and
      to catch whispered comments from the starers&rsquo; tongues, is likely to
      embarrass one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the comments were all friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Prince, &ldquo;I never see her look so pretty afore.
      I knew she was the best lookin&rsquo; girl in this town, but I never realized
      she was SUCH a beauty. Well, there&rsquo;s one thing sartin&rsquo;&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got the
      handsomest parson and parson&rsquo;s wife in THIS county, by about ten mile and
      four rows of apple trees. And there&rsquo;s the other bride that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be.
      I never see Keziah look so well, neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah did look well. Her parson had emerged triumphant from his battle
      with disease and adverse fate and was more than ever the idol of his
      congregation. He was to marry the girl of his choice&mdash;and hers. The
      housekeeper&rsquo;s ears were still ringing with the thanks of John and Grace.
      Both seemed to feel that to her, Keziah Coffin, more than anyone else,
      they owed their great joy. Some of the things they said she would never
      forget. And her own life, too, was freed forever of its burden, the secret
      which had hung over her for so many years. Only a very few knew that
      secret, and they would not disclose it. Toward the memory of the man
      buried in the stranger&rsquo;s lot at the cemetery she felt almost kindly now.
      While he lived she had feared and dreaded him, now she was beginning to
      forgive. For he had paid his debt with his life, and with her, beside her,
      was the other, the one whom she had loved, had given up, had mourned for,
      and who was now to be hers always. No wonder Keziah looked well. She was
      happy, and happiness is a wondrous beautifier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister went up the stairs to the pulpit. He was still white and
      thin, but his eyes were bright and his voice clear. He gave out the
      opening hymn and the service began.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said it was the finest sermon ever preached in that church, and
      perhaps it was. When it was over, before the benediction was pronounced,
      Ellery stepped out from behind the pulpit to the edge of the platform. He
      looked over the friendly faces upturned to his and, for an instant, it
      seemed that he could not trust himself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot let you go without a personal word. I owe
      you so much, all of you, that nothing I can say will convey to you my
      feeling of gratitude and love for this congregation and this church. You
      have stood by me all through. You trusted me and believed in me. I came to
      Trumet a stranger. I have found here the truest friends a man could hope
      to find&mdash;yes, and more than friends. If I live, and while I live, I
      shall hope to prove by the best effort that is in me my realization of the
      great debt I owe you and my desire to repay it, even though the payment
      must, of necessity, be so inadequate. God bless you all&mdash;and thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it lovely!&rdquo; gushed Didama. &ldquo;And when he said that about true
      friends he was lookin&rsquo; straight at Gracie all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t seem to me so,&rdquo; declared Gaius Winslow. &ldquo;I thought he was lookin&rsquo; 
      at Cap&rsquo;n Hammond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Parker, the doctor&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;I would
      have sworn he was looking at Keziah Coffin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Zebedee grinned. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was lookin&rsquo; at all of &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much hand shaking and congratulation and the church emptied
      slowly. Among the last to leave were the Peppers and Mr. Pratt. Lavinia
      took the minister aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ellery,&rdquo; she simpered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;that is, Caleb and me&mdash;will
      prob&rsquo;ly want you to&mdash;That is, we want you to be the one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Pepper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my sakes! you see&mdash;&lsquo;Bishy dear, come here a minute, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kyan approached, the picture of desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens to Betsy! Don&rsquo;t look so sour. A body&rsquo;d think you was goin&rsquo; to be
      hung, to look at you. &lsquo;Bishy, you tell Mr. Ellery all about it, there&rsquo;s a
      dear. He&rsquo;ll tell you, Mr. Ellery; and remember we count on you. Neither me
      nor Caleb wont have nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized Mr. Pratt by the arm and led him hastily away. Kyan looked
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hung?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I wish, by godfreys mighty, I had the hangin&rsquo; of
      SOME folks! I&rsquo;d put a tighter collar on &lsquo;em than they&rsquo;ve got now, I bet
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister&rsquo;s lips twitched. He knew what was coming. Hints of a
      surprising nature had been circulating about Trumet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Mr. Pepper?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Matter enough! You know what she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to do? She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
      marry THAT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word was emphasized by a furious gesticulation toward the back of
      the gentleman from Sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Mr. Pratt? Is your sister to marry him? Indeed! I congratulate them
      both&mdash;and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? What in tunket&mdash;I ask your pardon, Mr. Ellery, for talkin&rsquo; so in
      the meetin&rsquo; house&mdash;but what are you congratulatin&rsquo; me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because your sister is to have a good husband; at least people speak
      highly of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And because&mdash;well, Mr. Pepper, you have been quite confidential with
      me; we have shared secrets, you know; and I thought possibly the new
      arrangement might make it a bit more pleasant for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Mr. Pratt will take his bride home to Sandwich, and you, being
      here alone, will be more free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free?&rdquo; Kyan repeated the word wrathfully. &ldquo;Free! I&rsquo;ll be about as free as
      a settin&rsquo; hen under a barrel, I will. Is a feller free when he&rsquo;s got two
      pickin&rsquo; at him instead of one? I thought I was goin&rsquo; to have a little
      peace and comfort; I thought that same as you, Mr. Ellery. I&rsquo;ve had my
      suspicions as to her and him for some time. That day when I cal&rsquo;lated I&rsquo;d
      locked her up and come back to find she&rsquo;d gone buggy ridin&rsquo;, I thought
      &lsquo;twas queer. When she went to conference and left me alone I smelt a rat.
      When she took to letter writin&rsquo; the smell got stronger; until the last few
      weeks I&rsquo;ve been sartin of the game she was up to. And I never complained,
      no sir! Some brothers would have ripped up the eternal foundations afore
      they&rsquo;d have let their sister break up their home and desert &lsquo;em for a
      stiff-necked, bald-headed old shoe peddler like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! hush! Mr. Pepper. You forget&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t forget, nuther. Mr. Ellery, you don&rsquo;t know it all. When
      Laviny come to me and told me what she was goin&rsquo; to do, was I obstinate?
      Did I stand on my rights as head of the family and tell her she couldn&rsquo;t
      do it? No, sir-ee, I didn&rsquo;t! I was resigned. I says to her, &lsquo;Laviny,&rsquo; I
      says, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t say that I shan&rsquo;t be turrible lonesome without you. I won&rsquo;t
      say that I ain&rsquo;t sort of shocked and grieved at our partin&rsquo; after all
      these years. But what&rsquo;s my personal feelin&rsquo;s when I compare &lsquo;em with your
      happiness? Nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo; at all!&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Bless you, Laviny,&rsquo; says I.
      &lsquo;When you goin&rsquo; to go away?&rsquo; And what do you s&rsquo;pose she says to me? Why,
      that she wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; away at all. That&mdash;that Pratt thing has sold
      out his shoe store up to Sandwich and is comin&rsquo; here to live. Comin&rsquo; to
      live at our HOUSE, mind you, with her and with ME! &lsquo;&rsquo;Twill be so nice for
      you, &lsquo;Bishy dear,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;to have a man in the house to keep you
      comp&rsquo;ny and look out for you when I ain&rsquo;t round.&rsquo; Godfreys mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This portion of Kyan&rsquo;s disclosure was surprising, if the announcement of
      his sister&rsquo;s engagement was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pratt is coming to Trumet?&rdquo; the minister repeated. &ldquo;What for? What is
      he going to do here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep shoe store, I s&rsquo;pose likely. Laviny says there&rsquo;s a good openin&rsquo; for
      one in this town. I told her the best openin&rsquo; I could think of for him was
      the well and I hoped to the nation he&rsquo;d fall into it. Then she went for me
      like a dogfish after a herrin&rsquo; and I never had a taste of vittles till I&rsquo;d
      took it all back and said I was glad he was goin&rsquo; to live with us. Free!
      Don&rsquo;t talk to me about freedom! Godfreys mighty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ellery smothered his desire to laugh and expressed sympathy. Abishai
      listened in sullen silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, turning to go, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand it, if I can help
      it. I&rsquo;ve been doin&rsquo; some thinkin&rsquo; on my own account and there&rsquo;s two ways
      of gettin&rsquo; even. That Caleb critter is marryin&rsquo; into our family &lsquo;cause he
      knows I&rsquo;m well off. I&rsquo;ll cheat him, by godfreys! I&rsquo;ll will every cent of
      my fifteen hundred dollars to the poor or the heathen or somethin&rsquo;. I
      will, sure&rsquo;s taxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister was obliged to laugh, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;From what I hear, Mr. Pratt is worth
      several times fifteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; but he&rsquo;s so dum mean that &lsquo;twould break his heart to see even
      ten cents gettin&rsquo; away from him. However, that ain&rsquo;t my only plan. He and
      Laviny ain&rsquo;t got any mortgage on the marryin&rsquo; business. Other folks can do
      it as well as them. What do you think of Hannah Poundberry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I think of her? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what I mean. Just you keep that in your head, Mr. Ellery. You
      remember that I asked you, as man to man, &lsquo;What do you think of Hannah
      Poundberry?&rsquo;&mdash;Yes, yes, Laviny, I&rsquo;m a-comin&rsquo;. They want me to ask you
      to marry &lsquo;em,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll have to. But say, Mr. Ellery,
      when you do, just tell Pratt that your usual price for the job is ten
      dollars. That&rsquo;ll spile his honeymoon for him, or I miss my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away and moved sulkily toward his beckoning sister and her
      escort; but wheeled once more to add, in a mysterious whisper, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      forget now, Mr. Ellery. Remember that question I put to you: &lsquo;What do you
      think of&rsquo;&mdash;Yes, yes, La-viny, I hear you!&mdash;of you know who?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at the parsonage, Keziah was clearing the table and Captain
      Nat was helping her. A happy party of four had enjoyed the meal, John and
      Mrs. Coffin acting as hosts and Grace and the captain being the invited
      guests. Now the younger couple had gone over to the church, the bell of
      which was ringing for evening service.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up, Keziah,&rdquo; urged Nat. &ldquo;If you and me don&rsquo;t get decks cleared
      pretty soon we&rsquo;ll be late for meetin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;d hate to do that,
      considerin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m such a brand-new disciple, as you might say. What do we do
      next, shorten sail? Like this, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the cloth from the table, sending the crumbs flying in all
      directions, and proceeded to fold it, after a fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed with satisfaction; &ldquo;there she is, canvas furled and
      under bare poles. Now we can clear out, can&rsquo;t we? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah took the cloth from his hands and refolded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat Hammond,&rdquo; she said, laughing, &ldquo;you may be a good sailor, but you&rsquo;re
      an awful poor housekeeper. Look at the mess you&rsquo;ve made of that floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat looked at the scattered crumbs and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the everlastin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;I did make dirty weather on that tack,
      didn&rsquo;t I? Cal&rsquo;late I ain&rsquo;t much of a housekeeper, same as you say. Maybe
      that&rsquo;s why I was so dreadful anxious to get a good one to cruise along
      with me. Well, I&rsquo;ve got her. I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the back door of the kitchen, threw it open, and stood
      looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keziah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come here a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came from the dining room and stood at his side. He put an arm about
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look off there,&rdquo; he said, pointing with his free hand. &ldquo;See that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun was just setting and all the west was gorgeous with crimson and
      purple and yellow. The bay was spangled with fire, the high sand bluffs
      along the shore looked like broken golden ingots. The fields and swamps
      and salt meadows, rich in their spring glory of bud and new leaf, were
      tinged with the ruddy glow. The Trumet roofs were bathed in it, the old
      packet, asleep at her moorings by the breakwater, was silhouetted against
      the radiance. The church bell had ceased to ring and there was not a
      sound, except the low music of the distant surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at it, Keziah,&rdquo; urged Captain Nat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lookin&rsquo;, Nat,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it? I love it, you know that, and I never thought I should be
      anxious for the time to come when I must leave it. But I am. I want to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were to be married in another month. It would be a double wedding,
      for Grace and the minister were to be married at the same time. Then Nat
      and his wife were to go to New York, where a new ship, just out of the
      builders&rsquo; hands, was to be ready for him. She was a fine one, this
      successor to the Sea Mist. She had been building for more than a year and
      when Captain Hammond returned, safe and sound, and with their money in his
      possession, the owners decided at once that he should command the addition
      to their fleet. She was to sail for Liverpool and Keziah was to be a
      passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hardly wait to get to sea,&rdquo; went on Nat. &ldquo;Think of it! No more
      lonesome meals in the cabin, thinkin&rsquo; about you and about home. No, sir!
      you and home&rsquo;ll be right aboard with me. Think of the fun we&rsquo;ll have in
      the foreign ports. London, and you and me goin&rsquo; sightseein&rsquo; through it!
      And Havre and Gibraltar and Marseilles and Genoa and&mdash;and&mdash;by
      and by, Calcutta and Hong Kong and Singapore. I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;em all, of
      course, but you haven&rsquo;t. I tell you, Keziah, that time when I first saw a
      real hope of gettin&rsquo; you, that time after I&rsquo;d learned from John that that
      big trouble of yours was out of the way forever, on my way up to Boston in
      the cars I made myself a promise&mdash;I swore that if you did say yes to
      me I&rsquo;d do my best to make the rest of your life as smooth and pleasant as
      the past so far had been rough. I ain&rsquo;t rich enough to give you what you
      deserve, nowhere near; but I&rsquo;ll work hard and do my best, my girl&mdash;you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Keziah was looking out over the bay, her eyes brighter than the sunset.
      Now she turned to look up into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich!&rdquo; she repeated, with a little catch in her voice. &ldquo;Rich! there never
      was a woman in this world so rich as I am this minute. Or so happy,
      either.&rdquo;
     </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
